<u n="1" who="S0520">the idea is to meet <trunc>i</trunc> with them on the Sunday but <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I mean I'm not <trunc>tr</trunc> fully sure whether <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s going to go on this trip but he had planned to go on a motorcycle trip with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> this weekend so we're assuming <pause dur="long"/> that he's not going to be there</u>
<u n="2" who="S0519" trans="overlap">that's he just not</u>
<u n="3" who="S0520">which case it makes it harder for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because she is in control of the kids and both of them and like if we're at lunch and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s going spare</u>
<u n="4" who="S0519" trans="overlap">no no it's no fun</u>
<u n="5" who="S0520">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s there he can take him out and play whereas if it's just her</u>

<u n="7" who="S0521" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0519">no I thought let's take is we're going to meet them let's go to some sort of activity like er an adventure park or a a zoo or a something and take a picnic and walk round and chat and let the children have fun and run about</u>
<u n="9" who="S0520" trans="overlap">well what we were thinking is we'd go for lunch and then we'd do that but lunch is not the main event you know because with the the kids</u>
<u n="10" who="S0519" trans="overlap">well let's just have a picnic or fish and chips or you know</u>
<u n="11" who="S0520">we could but it's not as fun</u>
<u n="12" who="S0521" trans="overlap">it's <unclear/></u>
<u n="13" who="S0520">picnic is only nice when it's really sunny otherwise it's depressing</u>
<u n="14" who="S0519">yeah it's what I mean is if you book a restaurant for lunch I mean a nice café is better with a little park and as you say just have a quick lunch you know</u>
<u n="15" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0519">not a if you want to have a nice meal chat lunch it's too much for the kids</u>
<u n="17" who="S0520">yeah it doesn't work that's what she said as well which is fine yeah well in that case we should just decide on like a park or something to meet them and go around</u>
<u n="18" who="S0519">mm bring their bikes have a walk</u>
<u n="19" who="S0520" trans="overlap">have a walk the kids can do whatever</u>

<u n="27" who="S0520">you need to be doing stuff with them don't you? and that's fine and we could go out well we don't even have to go out all the time it's not really necessary</u>

<u n="322" who="S0521" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="323" who="S0520">erm and also it's just a quite a unique place I think because it's so small and because small population and they're sort of doing their own thing up there</u>
<u n="324" who="S0521">they're doing their own thing I think that's what I would say rather than it being integrated in Europe it's more</u>

<u n="330" who="S0519" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="331" who="S0520">came <trunc>a</trunc> came across quite strongly in some things like in their <trunc>ed</trunc> in their education system they were very strongly conditioned not to put themselves set themselves apart</u>

<u n="333" who="S0520">through any way you know through achievement for instance which you know is one of the main differences</u>

<u n="335" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="336" who="S0521">you in the when I went over generally speaking when I went to somewhere people would <pause dur="short"/> change their routine to suit me in other words typically we'd work late and things like that</u>
<u n="337" who="S0520">mm</u>
<u n="338" who="S0521">but the Norwegians they were out of the door at four o'clock whatever happened</u>

<u n="371" who="S0520" trans="overlap">it's a bit weird isn't it? yeah we did the same the Greece the first day you know always when you arrive you kind of don't get it yet and erm we tried all the restaurants were empty you know this was at nine PM anyway we thought we were late for dinner</u>
<u n="372" who="S0519" trans="overlap">mm mm no no that's right</u>
<u n="373" who="S0520">and erm</u>
<u n="374" who="S0519">well we could never had any problem getting a table cos we were far too early</u>

<u n="387" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="388" who="S0520">so everyone skis <pause dur="short"/> some</u>
<u n="389" who="S0521">I think the south of Norway's on a par with <anon type="place"/> isn't it? Stavanger's sort of more or less most of Norway would be north of <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="391" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="392" who="S0519">yeah</u>
<u n="393" who="S0520">and I mean the thing is is it's the Gulf Stream</u>
<u n="394" who="S0519" trans="overlap">but it's not it's not even Stavanger wouldn't be the same weather as <anon type="place"/> I would think it was much wetter</u>
<u n="395" who="S0521">because of the</u>
<u n="396" who="S0520">because it's on the west coast</u>
<u n="397" who="S0521" trans="overlap">western winds</u>
<u n="398" who="S0519" trans="overlap">it's on the west yeah</u>

<u n="405" who="S0519">yeah <anon type="place"/> yeah</u>
<u n="406" who="S0520">no temperature no and also the thing is erm the Gulf Stream goes I think it goes south of Britain and then it goes up towards erm Scandinavia and that's the only reason that it's even inhabitable</u>
<u n="407" who="S0521" trans="overlap">it's not frozen yeah</u>
<u n="408" who="S0520">because if you look at the equivalent <trunc>sa</trunc> on the south pole</u>

<u n="410" who="S0520">you know latitude south you know there's nothing it's just an ice cap</u>

<u n="415" who="S0521">that's true yeah</u>
<u n="416" who="S0519">and it's leaving us in you you know it's it's it's warming below us instead of warming us</u>
<u n="417" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="418" who="S0519">and causing us to be right in a kind of low pressure above it</u>
