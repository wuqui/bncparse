<u n="110" who="S0024">I don't know what that is</u>
<u n="111" who="S0144">no nor do I</u>
<u n="112" who="S0024">yeah</u>

<u n="116" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0144">which I don't know how critical it is in getting something <pause dur="short"/> I mean two weeks sounds like quite a long time to me</u>
<u n="118" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="120" who="S0024">yeah</u>

<u n="122" who="S0024">well wait what else can you do? That's what you've got to do</u>
<u n="123" who="S0144">well yeah but</u>
<u n="124" who="S0024">you've got to wait</u>
<u n="125" who="S0144">if it was private you'd get it done the next day wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0024">yeah I was talking to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> about private as well <pause dur="short"/> cos <trunc>sh</trunc> cos she works at the hospital she said you know they've only got a certain amount of things they can do with private healthcare <pause dur="short"/> and they can do all the diagnosis and stuff but when it comes to actual an operation or something else then they they ship them to the NHS hospital anyway</u>
<u n="127" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0024">so you literally just have to get um you have to get the the check done <pause dur="short"/> and that can be done like within a couple of days <pause dur="short"/> all of the checks done <pause dur="short"/> and then you go to the NHS with your consultant thing <pause dur="short"/> and you pass the piece of paper with the consultant thing on and they give you the treatment that you have to have <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="129" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> hm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0144">er</u>
<u n="132" who="S0024">so I was thinking that for some other people as well <pause dur="short"/> whether they should go do the private healthcare</u>
<u n="133" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="134" who="S0024">just to get the check out</u>
<u n="135" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="136" who="S0024">and then get your consultancy papers and everything</u>
<u n="137" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0024">every diagnosis that you've got <pause dur="short"/> and then go back onto the NHS</u>
<u n="139" who="S0144">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="140" who="S0024">there's no point in doing everything through private healthcare because they just</u>
<u n="141" who="S0144">no</u>
<u n="142" who="S0024">send you through the NHS anyway</u>
<u n="143" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's true <pause dur="short"/> it's the waiting isn't it?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0024">you just have to pay</u>
<u n="145" who="S0144">that's the biggest thing</u>
<u n="146" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0144">it's getting something done the next week or getting something done in three years' time <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="148" who="S0024">I was wondering as well you said that they've spent all their money</u>

<u n="156" who="S0024">well I'm sure they've got some left</u>
<u n="157" who="S0144">well he's always been a bit foolish with money really <pause dur="short"/> he's not gonna <trunc>l</trunc> start learning now</u>
<u n="158" who="S0024">well I think it it should be alright now they've got they've got some</u>

<u n="406" who="S0024">that's like these cures</u>

<u n="443" who="S0144">people don't want to go out and learn how to criticize things to get a a different perspective</u>
