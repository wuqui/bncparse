<u n="359" who="S0315">so that's what we'll do I'll teach you how to do the treatment</u>
<u n="360" who="S0255" trans="overlap">just remind me what the Shakira bits are as well the chakra bits cos</u>
<u n="361" who="S0315">so with the chakras you've got your base chakra okay?</u>
<u n="362" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="363" who="S0315">sometimes if this is out of alignment it can make everything be thrown out</u>
<u n="364" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="365" who="S0315">okay? so your base chakra is red okay?</u>
<u n="366" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="367" who="S0315">and then after that you've got your solar plexus</u>
<u n="368" who="S0255">mm hm</u>
<u n="369" who="S0315">which is orange and then you've got your <pause dur="short"/> erm stomach <pause dur="short"/> er no sorry you've got your reproductive organs which is orange and then you've got your erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> solar plexus which is yellow</u>
<u n="370" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="371" who="S0315">which is around here this is where you keep a lot of your emotions</u>
<u n="372" who="S0255">right yeah</u>
<u n="373" who="S0315" trans="overlap">okay? and then you've got your erm heart chakra which is green</u>
<u n="374" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="375" who="S0315">then you've got your throat chakra which is blue</u>
<u n="376" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="377" who="S0315">and then you've got your third eye chakra which is purple and then you've got your crown chakra which can be white gold silver</u>
<u n="378" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="379" who="S0315">anything called the higher self okay?</u>
<u n="380" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="381" who="S0315">so when these areas become out of sync with each other that's when they can throw certain areas</u>
<u n="382" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="383" who="S0315">out of you know tune with each other</u>
<u n="384" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="385" who="S0315">cos that's sometimes why you sometimes do experience maybe pains in certain areas because they become blocked <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="386" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="387" who="S0315">and also <trunc>cer</trunc> experience certain emotions as well that are unbalanced</u>
<u n="388" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="389" who="S0315">okay?</u>
<u n="390" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="391" who="S0315">so erm just by doing the reflexology treatment what we're doing is helping to stimulate the blood circulation all around the body again</u>
<u n="392" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="393" who="S0315">okay? and erm just helping to erm <trunc>r</trunc>relieve any blockages which are going through the meridian lines which run all the way down the body and these meridian lines</u>
<u n="394" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="395" who="S0315">run all the way down the body and they link up with each other</u>
<u n="396" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="397" who="S0315">okay?</u>
<u n="398" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="399" who="S0315">so sometimes if you have a pain in your shoulder</u>
<u n="400" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="401" who="S0315">sometimes it can show in your knee</u>
<u n="402" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="403" who="S0315">because it's in the same zone</u>
<u n="404" who="S0255">yeah okay</u>
<u n="405" who="S0315">okay? <trunc>d</trunc>do you understand?</u>

<u n="408" who="S0255">yeah it makes sense</u>
<u n="409" who="S0315"><unclear/> sometimes it's quite hard to</u>
<u n="410" who="S0255">no</u>
<u n="411" who="S0315">get the gist of <pause dur="short"/> erm so by doing this treatment we're working on the top of the feet top of the toes all the way down to the bottom</u>
<u n="412" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="413" who="S0315">and just helping to stimulate all these areas just to help everything unblock</u>
<u n="414" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="415" who="S0315">and channel better</u>
<u n="416" who="S0255">yeah okay</u>
<u n="417" who="S0315">okay?</u>
<u n="418" who="S0255" trans="overlap">that makes sense yeah</u>
<u n="419" who="S0315">so erm what we'll do first of all is we'll do some <trunc>brea</trunc> deep breathing before we start going into the treatment</u>
<u n="420" who="S0255">mm hm</u>
<u n="421" who="S0315">do some relaxation techniques on the feet to help relax those</u>
<u n="422" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0315">and then I'll work on <pause dur="short"/> erm the right foot first and then I'll work on the left foot afterwards</u>
<u n="424" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="425" who="S0315">okay? cos I like to work on one foot at a time</u>
<u n="426" who="S0255">yeah</u>

<u n="428" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="429" who="S0315">and then bring you round and just tell you about what I've found</u>

<u n="961" who="S0315"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="962" who="S0255">but it's really nice wine <pause dur="short"/> so we <trunc>g</trunc>we got in the habit of just having a box of wine there all the time and just</u>
<u n="963" who="S0315" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="gasp"/> just tipping er topping it up</u>

<u n="966" who="S0255" trans="overlap">no no this is it <pause dur="short"/> so now again we <trunc>b</trunc> we try and be more careful so it's er I mean the fact he's away in the week I don't drink in the week now</u>
<u n="967" who="S0315" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="968" who="S0255">but at weekend yeah we'll we'll have a couple of glasses of wine or so and</u>
<u n="969" who="S0315">I think if I didn't work in the evenings you know what? I think I'd be terrible</u>
<u n="970" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="971" who="S0315">I think I'd always be having at least a glass or two</u>
<u n="972" who="S0255">yeah oh yeah</u>
<u n="973" who="S0315">cos when I was off last week I know I was off having <trunc>n</trunc> was it last week that I was off? I think the week er before that</u>
<u n="974" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="975" who="S0315">I was off for a week and we were <trunc>j</trunc> having a drink every night</u>
<u n="976" who="S0255">oh yeah</u>
<u n="977" who="S0315">it's terrible</u>
<u n="978" who="S0255">you get in the habit of it don't you?</u>
<u n="979" who="S0315">you do and it just goes down too easily</u>
<u n="980" who="S0255">yeah cos it's er they're saying about this Stoptober thing oh that's the smoking isn't it? or stay sober for October and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was saying last night about it saying well she can't think how it can work cos people that only go out at the weekend and have a couple of drinks or so or if they're gonna stop that it's not actually that much and if you're drinking every day who drinks every day? only alcoholics</u>
<u n="981" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="982" who="S0255">and I said well actually not really I said there's so many people that get in from work now and will quite naturally in an evening always have a glass of wine</u>
<u n="983" who="S0315">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="984" who="S0255">or maybe two and you don't realise what you're actually drinking</u>
<u n="985" who="S0315">cos you could er actually be classed as maybe an <vocal desc="laugh"/> alcoholic couldn't you?</u>
<u n="986" who="S0255">well yeah yeah</u>
<u n="987" who="S0315">when you think about it</u>
<u n="988" who="S0255">this is it yeah this is it so</u>
<u n="989" who="S0315">a lot of people come home from work they're that stressed they crack open a bottle of wine</u>
<u n="990" who="S0255" trans="overlap">oh yeah exactly</u>
<u n="991" who="S0315">and they drink it</u>
<u n="992" who="S0255">yeah exactly and just general chatting with friends which I've done you know er a lot over the years and you talk to people and actually you sometimes realise oh yeah and they've said actually yeah I do drink every night</u>
<u n="993" who="S0315">mm</u>
<u n="994" who="S0255">a couple of glasses of wine and maybe a few more at the weekend cos friends'll be round we'll have a meal and you just don't realise how it's actually just all building up all the time</u>
<u n="995" who="S0315" trans="overlap">when you think if you were er to write it down I think you'd be shocked how much you probably</u>
<u n="996" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="997" who="S0315">were consuming</u>
<u n="998" who="S0255">yeah yeah so I'm seeing the point of this you know stay sober and not have any and but for me to do that and then they're saying you're raising money for Macmillan or for whoever but for me if you're gonna stop drinking and then you get people to sponsor you or er that just seems really strange so</u>
<u n="999" who="S0315">yeah yeah funny way of doing it</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0255">I mean yeah I I can understand thinking actually I'm not gonna drink for the next so many weeks and just do that for my health and do this and do that</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0255">but it just seems a bit of a <pause dur="short"/> a strange concept to say to do that</u>

<u n="1510" who="S0315">does she?</u>
<u n="1511" who="S0255">and I'd got so I wouldn't play the game with her any more and I wouldn't do that and it was it was amazing and then obviously with dad being ill it it was it er changed things a bit er but then with him obviously once he died it she I <trunc>m</trunc>I made allowances for her and we got getting back into that sort of routine</u>
<u n="1512" who="S0315">mm</u>

<u n="1545" who="S0255" trans="overlap">just religion and the self and yeah and and she would actually then not be so controlling she could just be herself and <pause dur="short"/> I don't think she'll do it now but I mean she did say once you know yeah in years to come I might just disappear off to a retreat and <trunc>w</trunc>would you think that was bad or wrong? and I just said no <trunc>absolu</trunc> you know if you felt that was what you wanted to do</u>

<u n="1846" who="S0315">into your stomach area <pause dur="short"/> absorbing in filling you <pause dur="short"/> lovely yellow tones <pause dur="long"/> and then the next colour is green this is for your heart chakra <pause dur="short"/> so if you visualise a lovely luscious green tree bright green leaves <pause dur="short"/> absorbing that colour into your heart <pause dur="long"/> and then the next colour is blue for the throat chakra <pause dur="short"/> so think of a lovely blue blue sky <pause dur="long"/> absorbing that colour round your throat chakra <pause dur="long"/> and now we're gonna visualise purple and violet the third eye chakra <pause dur="short"/> so in the middle of your forehead <pause dur="short"/> just imagine lovely purple tones <pause dur="short"/> absorbing through <pause dur="short"/> into your forehead <pause dur="long"/> and now we're <trunc>g</trunc> last we're gonna do the crown chakra so I like to visualise silver and gold ribbons <pause dur="long"/> all flowing in the wind <pause dur="short"/> or a halo of gold around the crown <pause dur="long"/> and then just imagine those tree roots growing out of your feet planting themselves into the ground grounding you back down to earth <pause dur="short"/> rebalancing that body <pause dur="short"/> centring everything <pause dur="long"/> so I'm gonna talk you through a relaxation technique now which I do <pause dur="short"/> so what I want <trunc>y</trunc>what I want you to practise <pause dur="short"/> is breathing in for seven so as you're breathing in counting in your head <pause dur="short"/> up to seven <pause dur="short"/> and then on the exhale <pause dur="short"/> breathing out but counting down to eleven <pause dur="long"/> so ever so slowly just let that breath out <pause dur="short"/> and counting to eleven <pause dur="short"/> they call it the seven eleven breathing technique <pause dur="short"/> and it's supposed to do something with the gases inside the brain <pause dur="short"/> and that's where the real action relaxation comes in so whenever you're feeling stressed <pause dur="short"/> or overwhelmed and you feel like you need to just calm down just remember your seven eleven breathing so just go somewhere quiet or <trunc>h</trunc> <trunc>e</trunc>even you you can get to the point where you can do it so well that you can just do it on the spot without even thinking about it</u>
