<u n="1" who="S0642">is that music a problem?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0486">no I don't think so</u>
<u n="3" who="S0642">alright then</u>
<u n="4" who="S0486">hi <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> thank you for talking to me today erm so can you tell me about the art course you're running here?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0642">yes this is a a recreational course at the Creative Innovation Centre so the creative the word creative innovation is key to the sort of course we do here it's not the normal erm sort of for instance watercolour for beginners type course so a lot of the erm the people who attend are the majority of them are mature people and quite a few have experienced a reasonably good or very er professional art education but it's open to erm anyone really and we have about twenty doing painting and drawing in the morning and about twenty doing the life drawing and the nearest you could say was related to would be a foundation type course</u>
<u n="6" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="7" who="S0642">in an art school so it's quite diagnostic in a sense</u>
<u n="8" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right okay</u>
<u n="9" who="S0642">but it's very erm liberally individually biased er in the sense that people are encouraged to sort of work in a way that suits them and I suppose my philosophy would be that they'll learn more from each other than they would from me</u>
<u n="10" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="11" who="S0642">cos cos they work they're encouraged to experiment really</u>
<u n="12" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right okay so what sort of qualification do they get afterwards is it in line with an art access course or anything?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0642" trans="overlap">no there is no qualification as such</u>
<u n="14" who="S0486" trans="overlap">no okay</u>
<u n="15" who="S0642">so it's not it's not a ratified recognisable</u>
<u n="16" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="17" who="S0642">erm educational qualification it it is purely recreational</u>
<u n="18" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="19" who="S0642">but it's also seen as part of the sort of a wider remit here where we do all sorts of music and poetry and languages and performance</u>
<u n="20" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="21" who="S0642">and even theatre occasionally</u>
<u n="22" who="S0486">yeah</u>

<u n="61" who="S0642" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0486">although I could see that there was a bit of humour in it but it was incredibly poignant and it left me feel you know with a a feeling of erm she'd been on the run all her life basically and that's what that's what the feeling it left me with erm so erm they do a lot of films down at the Odeon <trunc>a</trunc>and do they do any ballet dancing films or any of that sort of thing here? any dance?</u>
