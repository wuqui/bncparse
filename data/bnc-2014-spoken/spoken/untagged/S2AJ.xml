<u n="262" who="S0441">she's such a moron</u>
<u n="263" who="S0439">yup and then no one had told my mum <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> hadn't told my mum</u>
<u n="264" who="S0441">they should speak to the home about this</u>

<u n="266" who="S0441">are they going to?</u>
<u n="267" who="S0439">yeah</u>

<u n="270" who="S0441">she needs to say that they need to be informed</u>

<u n="272" who="S0441">that's horrendous</u>
<u n="273" who="S0439">for the hospital to not even know that you've had two children</u>
<u n="274" who="S0441">what a dick she is</u>
<u n="275" who="S0439">I know and then they tried to get hold of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and they couldn't and then they messaged me and were like could you message <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> so she can get hold of her mum so she can fucking talk to us they're lucky he only had well not lucky but he only had gastroenteritis so it wasn't like he was dying or anything</u>
<u n="276" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="277" who="S0439">he just had a very horrible stomach but it's just ridiculous how they rang <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like every day and they couldn't get through to her and then she sent them one text message on Sunday being like oh he's fine he's moaning again</u>
<u n="278" who="S0441">great</u>

<u n="284" who="S0441">what a dick</u>
<u n="285" who="S0439">and then they're arguing because grandad wanted to leave us money when he dies and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> doesn't want him to because she wants any money that not that there's going to be any money left over to be honest but you know</u>
<u n="286" who="S0441">why does she want it all? I don't understand</u>
<u n="287" who="S0439">because apparently she's poor or</u>
<u n="288" who="S0441">I don't know why she wants it all but sure that's doesn't</u>
<u n="289" who="S0439">it's because he wanted to leave us five thousand pounds each which for me and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> obviously isn't as much as her because she's got three children</u>
<u n="290" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="291" who="S0439">and also she's got all these great grandchildren so she feels like she has to like distribute the money further</u>
<u n="292" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="293" who="S0439">but that's her choice you know like that's not grandad's choice grandad's doesn't want to support his great grandchildren he doesn't really care that much about them</u>
<u n="294" who="S0441">no</u>
<u n="295" who="S0439">sounds horrible but he doesn't care enough but she's like you know it's just not fair I think all the money should go to us and my mum's like but he doesn't want that and she basically just being really dicky about it</u>
<u n="296" who="S0441">moron <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="297" who="S0439">you know when you just look at your your own siblings and you just think I can't ever imagine being in a</u>
<u n="298" who="S0441" trans="overlap">I know</u>
<u n="299" who="S0439">state with them as what they are</u>
<u n="300" who="S0441">I never want to be like that with my brother</u>

<u n="302" who="S0441">it's just so sad</u>
<u n="303" who="S0439">yeah I can't imagine ever arguing with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> over money</u>
<u n="304" who="S0441">no</u>
<u n="305" who="S0439">because we both just be like if mum and dad die just split it</u>
<u n="306" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="307" who="S0439">there'd be no question on well you know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you didn't live in the country for how many years and so I've done more therefore I deserve more money like</u>
<u n="308" who="S0441">it doesn't work like that</u>
<u n="309" who="S0439">yeah it doesn't like that's not how it works you just everything you just half it it is like there's just no respect from the other person</u>
<u n="310" who="S0441">no <pause dur="short"/> what a dick?</u>
<u n="311" who="S0439">yeah</u>

<u n="313" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="314" who="S0441">I mean to be fair my nanny did leave more money to others than she did to</u>
<u n="315" who="S0439">but then I guess it's their decision or who to be executive</u>
<u n="316" who="S0441">yeah exactly er</u>
<u n="317" who="S0439">and there was this case in the news the other week that really annoyed me actually this woman went to court because her mum didn't leave her any money in her will because she ran off she got married and she ran off with somebody her mum didn't like so her mum basically cut her off and they never spoke they did not speak from the time the woman ran off with her husband until the time her mum died</u>
<u n="318" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="319" who="S0439">so her mum was just like basically disowned her she's like you're not my daughter I don't really want anything to do with you I don't want to leave you my estate and it was like a lot of money and the daughter went to court to get it and you're just like mm I think that's really unfair</u>
<u n="320" who="S0441">yes</u>
<u n="321" who="S0439">because the daughter didn't deserve like she just didn't deserve the money you know it's the mum's money</u>
<u n="322" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="323" who="S0439">she didn't like her mum she just wanted the money and you're just like</u>
<u n="324" who="S0441">it is not good</u>
<u n="325" who="S0439">yeah it's like her will the will should have been I think should have been final and it wasn't which I thought was really bad</u>
<u n="326" who="S0441">what so it got over run?</u>
<u n="327" who="S0439">yeah the will got overturned and the daughter got something like two hundred and fifty thousand pounds or something like that <event desc="sound of tap running"/> well it might even been more either way though it was a lot of money and you're just like that isn't what the mum wanted she wanted her money to go to charity</u>
<u n="328" who="S0441">yeah <event desc="sound of tap running"/></u>
