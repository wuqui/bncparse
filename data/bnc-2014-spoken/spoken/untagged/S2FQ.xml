<u n="1" who="S0261">we've just been spending time talking with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> er about things</u>
<u n="2" who="S0262">to do with social storytelling and how to teach someone how to problem solve <pause dur="short"/> do we do this in a traditional way? or do we do this in an experimental way? and I suggest that we do it in an experimental way because that will get us to become more creative <pause dur="long"/> and I think that some of the suggestions that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> made could be worthwhile discussing in saying put into the good pile or put into the not sure about that pile</u>
<u n="3" who="S0261">okay so one of the key things is about erm ensuring that we operate within a certain niche</u>
<u n="4" who="S0262">mm mm</u>
<u n="5" who="S0261" trans="overlap">er however that might be formed and <pause dur="short"/> you can operate in a variety of niches er but you need to find a target audience that is focused enough and interested enough such that you can reach them effectively and that's kind of the context of the way the web works right so if you keep it general then you'll be predominantly using general terms to be able to cover everything and so you will pick up a whole variety of people but not necessarily be anybody who is focused enough or interested enough on any range of topics to be able to buy what you are into if you focus it on a particular group then and become relative experts in that by bringing together others in that group that the others can learn from then that carries a lot more power and er and therefore you can create a community that has more focus and and by default people who will purchase products because they are intrinsically interested in that particular topic</u>
<u n="6" who="S0262">yeah that will require a bit of market research <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="7" who="S0261">well you could certainly pick anything and you can go I am going to run through this process with the same <unclear/> erm and <vocal desc="cough"/> there's so many different things that you could do so many different things</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="8" who="S0262">yeah but what?  what should we start with? I mean what's the sort of thing that's going to be the most compelling?</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="9" who="S0261"><vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="long"/> erm</u>
<u n="10" who="S0262">and how much of it has got a kind of teaching not teaching but an educational kind of slant to it? <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="11" who="S0261">what's the education element?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0262">I don't know I don't know whether you bring in as an interviewer whether I'm you know bringing in some erm say external reading from different authors or I am just really keeping everything on track just being an interviewer and focusing right onto the person whose er <trunc>whose</trunc> who I am interviewing and just finding out about their life story</u>
<u n="13" who="S0261">you see I've got this this thing about problem solving I don't I'm not convinced that's what it's about <pause dur="long"/> I don't think that's the the end of what the story telling journey is about I don't think it is about demonstrating how to problem solve <pause dur="short"/> I think it's more about trying to bring together a community in an alternative way which is through the storytelling mechanism and highlighting <pause dur="short"/> how to bring people together to connect effectively and by default they end up solving the problem in order to make progress so the problem is kind of built into that process that it is part of the story line to to demonstrate the mechanism</u>
<u n="14" who="S0262">mm <pause dur="long"/> so how do you get people's attention to come in and talk about something to begin with?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0261">okay let's just for example say talk let's say car mechanics okay just for the sake of it and you've got erm Johnny who's just left school and he wants to be a car mechanic and he's got an interest and he's been doing some stuff himself and he has a problem <pause dur="short"/> and really what is really what it is about is more not solving a problem about how to fix a car but it is how can he get connected enough such that he can do something that he really wants to do? yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0261">and too often what happens is you know there's all this formal bullshit HR I need a good person I need to apply for a job a thousand ways using shitty CV interview approach with some a lot of people don't know how to interview and I am not given the opportunity to demonstrate myself or to show how valuable I can be to these people right and you will get people on all sorts of different levels but the reality is is that there is a comparative level and connection which goes together with personality and it goes together with skill base yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0262">yeah but I don't want it to become just about finding a job for example</u>
<u n="19" who="S0261">no no no I am not I am just all I've I am not talking about finding a job all I'm doing is using that as an example that that this person wants to go forward in some context in this case I said he wanted to jump forward in doing what he is passionate about</u>
<u n="20" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0261">which is car mechanics</u>
<u n="22" who="S0262">yeah no I get that so it is more like</u>
<u n="23" who="S0261">he could he could go down</u>
<u n="24" who="S0262" trans="overlap">goal</u>
<u n="25" who="S0261" trans="overlap">the race track</u>
<u n="26" who="S0262">let me speak it is all about <trunc>goa</trunc> setting goals and achieving goals in a sort of realistic way erm that's something another way of framing what you are saying is that you know you want to be closer to your goal whatever it is that you have set <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="27" who="S0261">yeah you could say that you could say that mm mm</u>
<u n="28" who="S0262">the only reason why I kind of I know what you mean but <pause dur="long"/> I know the word the word problem is a problem</u>
<u n="29" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0262">but solving isn't solving like a riddle or solving a situation whatever isn't a problem I think solving things finding ways to solve things is very useful for people <pause dur="short"/> it is very very practical</u>
<u n="31" who="S0261" trans="overlap">so it's it's crowd solving</u>
<u n="32" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0261">now we find a a synonym for solving yeah</u>
<u n="34" who="S0262">yeah crowd solving yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0261">something like that yeah and <pause dur="short"/> you know what I see as important is the collaborative nature of it</u>
<u n="36" who="S0262">yeah that's really big and he looked like that</u>
<u n="37" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0262"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> liked that and he thought that it was in its <unclear/> form</u>
<u n="39" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0262" trans="overlap">how to really collaborate</u>
<u n="41" who="S0261">effectively to do something efficiently</u>
<u n="42" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0261" trans="overlap">so what you are trying to demonstrate is er as an outcome of this thing is over a very short period of time you are demonstrating comparative er progress that it is significant progress</u>
<u n="44" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0261" trans="overlap">that's that's what you are showing people if <pause dur="short"/> if you if you come and see us we will show you we will provide you a mechanism through storylines that will get you from A to E in one week that will be so much faster than if you tried to do it yourself and the collaborative element isn't what we are showing in the in the stream of er <pause dur="short"/> connection to connection it is the input that comes in from outside that may steer that storyline</u>
<u n="46" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="47" who="S0261">yeah which we kind of indicated up on the board the other day about how you really need this other input</u>
<u n="48" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0261">and that gets the community involved in you know and you would have seen examples of that on telly I think with with programming and stuff</u>
<u n="50" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0261">where either the storyline is defined by some outside source or the likes of Big Brother where people vote on who survives and who doesn't</u>
<u n="52" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0261" trans="overlap">or whatever yeah but it is not as crass as that</u>
<u n="54" who="S0262">no</u>
<u n="55" who="S0261">it is not crass in any sense</u>
<u n="56" who="S0262">no it is meant to be educational</u>
<u n="57" who="S0261">it is supposed to be educational and and if people don't get the sense of <pause dur="short"/> I have the opportunity to go forward by miles by being involved in this that's what the catch is for people</u>
<u n="58" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and and if we can demonstrate to people erm <pause dur="short"/> we can help you be connected in such a way using this creative process that will be very different from what your traditional path would be so that's where you are carving out your own real niche because you're you are using the creative processes which everybody is cracking on about</u>
<u n="60" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0261" trans="overlap">but you are actually demonstrating how effective they can be in a very short period of time</u>
<u n="62" who="S0262">well this is going to fascinate me on what niche we're <trunc>gonn</trunc> we're gonna  settle on because we kind of know our demographic <pause dur="short"/> we kind of know what our method is going to be we know what the experiment's aim is we just don't know yet what the topic is now next week next Wednesday there's a debate being put on by <anon type="place"/> university it is down in the city <pause dur="short"/> it starts at five thirty finishes at eight and you can register for it if you're are interested it is about face-to-face versus to online and it is pretty much a debate really about you know which is best? I suppose erm there's a couple of professors there's gonna be erm a erm a sort of journo type down there there's going to be erm the person who heads up <anon type="place"/> which I think is a depression</u>
<u n="63" who="S0261">it is a depression site yeah</u>
<u n="64" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah so you've got a couple of academics thrown in <pause dur="short"/> it's a free event and I thought mm it just it would be interesting to watch a debate you know about something that's involving young people you know as well and see what sort of parameters there are within the debate what sort of things are they picking up on? what sort of you know what are the main arguments in this debate?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0261">so do you think they are going to pick up on threads like erm <pause dur="short"/> er the people are becoming more disconnected and hence more depressed and et cetera et cetera? <pause dur="short"/> well because what we've been talking about</u>
<u n="66" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0261">and what I believe in is that it needs to be balanced</u>
<u n="68" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0261">and so if if you can pin this together in such a way that there is a real community that's meeting</u>
<u n="70" who="S0262">yeah <vocal desc="yawn"/></u>
<u n="71" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and like some other models that are working around the world at the moment you can set up satellite communities in different places around the world which are doing exactly the same model as you you are that the inputs can be international but the local community base is of the local ilk</u>
<u n="72" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and that can have representatives who come from other places who join there and so they become part of a like community</u>
<u n="74" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0261">erm <pause dur="long"/> we we need to look at it in two ways we need to look at it in the context of if we have a focused niche what is the lifespan of that focused niche? where does it go? how long can the storylines be? erm <pause dur="short"/> I like the context of the start-up thread because erm <pause dur="short"/> quite often in that case <pause dur="short"/> well you've picked a niche yeah it is just that there's massive variety within the niche yeah so the people who are of a certain ilk who will be interested in how that goes together <pause dur="short"/> erm if you look at like <anon type="place"/> as an example a lot of the topics that are talked on there are a whole range of different topics</u>
<u n="78" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's true it is just that it is about start-ups</u>
<u n="79" who="S0262">and they all <trunc>fe</trunc> they all fell under that</u>
<u n="80" who="S0262">entrepreneurial</u>
<u n="81" who="S0261" trans="overlap">thing yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0262">so start-ups now what's a definition of a start-up?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0261">erm there's actually a proper definition of it erm a lot of people think it's just kind of starting up a company but erm there is a formal definition of it let me just find out erm <pause dur="long"/> I needed that that was the most pizzery burp in the world</u>
<u n="84" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh you didn't need to say that on on the sound recording</u>
<u n="85" who="S0261">I just said the most pizzery burp how burpy pizzery it was so I am just looking up the definition of start-up because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> asked me and I don't actually know the proper definition so we are going to find out off erm <pause dur="long"/> I don't want to go Google ads <pause dur="short"/> start-up <pause dur="long"/> just waiting for Google start company Wiki <pause dur="long"/> a start-up company or start-up is a company a partnership a temporary organisation designed to search for repeatable and scalable business model <pause dur="short"/> these companies generally newly created are in a phase of development and research for markets <pause dur="long"/> there you go <pause dur="short"/> start-ups usually utilise a casual <trunc>at</trunc> a casual attitude in some respects to promote efficiency in the workplace which is needed in order to get their business off the ground <pause dur="short"/> nineteen <trunc>si</trunc> in a nineteen sixty study Douglas McGregor stressed that punishments and rewards for uniformity in the workplace is not necessary as some people are born with motivation to work without incentives this removal of stresses allows the workers and researchers to focus less on the work environment around them and more at the <trunc>t</trunc> at the task at hand giving them the potential to achieve something great for the company <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> the point about the start-up is er repeatable and scalable business model that's the <trunc>ke</trunc> the core part of the definition erm so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was talking to us on that context start-up is it scalable? yeah and scalable is an element of well to what degree? for how long? for how large? massive?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0262">actually you know what</u>
<u n="87" who="S0261" trans="overlap">can it continue to grow?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0262" trans="overlap">he's kind of got a point because the more I'm thinking about it the more I like it because even the latest research from academics that would be put into a curriculum won't be nearly as up to date oh no no current as some of the things that we would discuss</u>
<u n="89" who="S0261">yeah it is already behind the times</u>
<u n="90" who="S0262">but it means</u>
<u n="91" who="S0261" trans="overlap">anything that's published is like that</u>
<u n="92" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0261" trans="overlap">because it takes time to be able to publish it</u>
<u n="94" who="S0262">well yeah but nowadays we can have quite a lot of you know immediate publishing you know in terms of news <unclear/></u>
<u n="95" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah but once it is published it is old news</u>
<u n="96" who="S0262">yeah I'm talking about curriculum in universities</u>
<u n="97" who="S0261">okay so carry on what is it that you like?</u>
<u n="98" who="S0262">it's it's it's it's current</u>
<u n="99" who="S0261">what is it that you like? <pause dur="short"/> you said that we're talking about <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and scalable and then you said oh and this er the more I think about it the more I like you like what?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0262">okay that erm <pause dur="short"/> if you are a student studying business and you wanted to know about start-ups you take a unit in start-ups that unit would be a year out of date only because I know how long it takes to get a <trunc>curric</trunc> a unit into curriculum</u>
<u n="101" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and validated</u>
<u n="103" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and accredited</u>
<u n="105" who="S0261">so it is quite <pause dur="short"/> potentially it's it's it's possible that the the data that you taught is just out of date right and the idea though is that a university system should be flexible enough to allow people to <pause dur="short"/> to look at the coalface and look at what is up to date</u>
<u n="106" who="S0262">they are meant to have their lecturer do that for them by bringing in their own research and their research informs their teaching but it doesn't happen that way people say it happens like that but it doesn't</u>
<u n="107" who="S0261">right okay  alright so what is it that you like? you like that</u>
<u n="108" who="S0262">that if you are a student</u>
<u n="109" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="110" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and you want to learn about start-ups you ain't get your needs satisfied at university unless you're incredibly lucky</u>
<u n="111" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0262" trans="overlap">so if you are young you are thinking about making a start-up</u>
<u n="113" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you think maybe I should go to university and study this oh no crap I am not going to study this at university I am going to find another way and this is a complementary way of looking at things</u>
<u n="115" who="S0261">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> erm I am definitely for the case of being in a place where <pause dur="long"/> now we talked about a variety of different things but being in a place where we are sitting in the market where people who would <pause dur="short"/> who would or have gone to university <pause dur="short"/> are going to fall out of that and be interested in looking at something else</u>
<u n="116" who="S0262">in fact I can think of of already three people I could interview <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0261">yeah mm mm and the good thing with with with probably all of them is that they have a connection they had probably if you get them to distribute what they are talking about effectively and you somehow attach a product to it that by word of mouth you can get stuff out there fairly quickly</u>
<u n="118" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="119" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and erm that's what intrigued me so much about this <anon type="place"/> lot who have done this <anon type="place"/> thing yeah <pause dur="short"/> because they talked he talked through his mechanism of how they got their voice out there about this stuff between them they sent an email out to eight hundred friends yeah and <pause dur="short"/> they sent out this email that said erm here guys a fifty percent discount voucher <pause dur="short"/> you can operate our site do this and you will get fifty percent off <pause dur="short"/> so the email went out to eight hundred people and they could through analytics find out that three thousand two hundred people looked at that yeah <pause dur="short"/> they <pause dur="short"/> got <pause dur="short"/> erm quite a large number of people buying stuff off this site and this is their first very first kind of get go <pause dur="short"/> erm and through that their story got into the press because they were enough of of a different model and they were the <anon type="place"/> it was called and so somebody bothered to write about who they were <pause dur="short"/> and then went on to how they went to expand the company and they used some fairly straightforward techniques but they come across as quite clever erm to get massive exposure yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0261">erm they simply came across a Youtube video of sixteen year olds who were teaching each other how to put on makeup and so they contacted a girl in the US who was teaching this to other students and making money out of it</u>
<u n="122" who="S0262">mm mm</u>
<u n="123" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and they said we would like to use you to promote our products we have got custom design your own shoe and they ended up having to pay her money because she had a Hollywood agent and so on and so on they paid her some money she did it <pause dur="short"/> in the time to build up to that time through their however long they had been running they had had two hundred thousand visitors to the site through other press stuff on this particular day with this one person on Youtube doing a promotional video for their product one day they had two hundred thousand people look at their website</u>
<u n="124" who="S0262">wow</u>
<u n="125" who="S0261">right <pause dur="short"/> of those two hundred thousand people ninety-five thousand of them left comments of postiveness on their product</u>
<u n="126" who="S0262">wow</u>
<u n="127" who="S0261">on that site on that day and <pause dur="short"/> what they found out was quite odd they thought at the time <pause dur="short"/> the majority of people who were contacting them directly weren't actually people who had the money to buy the shoes they were thirteen year olds so there were people who were looking up to the sixteen year old who were her natural market</u>
<u n="128" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0261">and so they had that problem and so they sent out another another way of doing it and after three weeks they actually got to their target market which were er business women yeah who would be paying two hundred bucks for a pair of shoes <vocal desc="sneeze"/> but they still got a massive uplift in sales</u>
<u n="130" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0261">so that just shows through using a different mechanism how and and there's nothing complicated about what they've done <pause dur="short"/> they've just used a certain different approach they have managed to get a massive voice out there for what they have done</u>
<u n="132" who="S0262">they have yeah without much of a marketing budget by the sounds of things</u>
<u n="133" who="S0261">well they've just used things <pause dur="short"/> to they've use the collaborative nature of the crowd</u>
<u n="134" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0261">to to create a viral story</u>
<u n="136" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0261">and the reason why it is is because there are enough <pause dur="short"/> they're of enough <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="138" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="139" who="S0261">they they have a different enough idea that it is disruptive to an existing industry</u>
<u n="140" who="S0262">well I would say our idea is probably quite disruptive</u>
<u n="141" who="S0261">so <pause dur="long"/> it is easy enough to sit here and think through the nature of <pause dur="short"/> the the process of <unclear>grabbing</unclear> somebody saying what is it that you really want to do? what's different that you would like to try and progress with?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0261">and what is it that's holding you up at the moment? what's your hurdle? yeah so you would go through that you would discover what the hurdle is <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> you know a lot of things are simply just you need to go and do it more than anything</u>
<u n="144" who="S0262">yeah you do but I think you know you've got to talk to the right people and suss out your ideas a bit more as well because like honestly it hadn't occurred to me until today and it obviously had to you but you hadn't discussed it with me</u>
<u n="145" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="146" who="S0262">that it was going to be on a certain kind of niche I hadn't got got that from what we put up on the board those problems are three very very different types of problems</u>
<u n="147" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0262">they are you know not really related to each other</u>
<u n="149" who="S0261">mm mm</u>
<u n="150" who="S0262">so from what we put on the board I was running with this very general kind of sense of things</u>
<u n="151" who="S0261">and that's fine as long as you block all of those things under the guise of they're all students</u>
<u n="152" who="S0262">yeah but I think you will get</u>
<u n="153" who="S0261" trans="overlap">well they are all problems that students could learn</u>
<u n="154" who="S0262" trans="overlap">the topic I think I understand though the question is one thing but the topic is another and it is true like what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> does is he says the topic is about entrepreneurs</u>
<u n="155" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0262">that's the topic</u>
<u n="157" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="158" who="S0262">the questions I ask</u>
<u n="159" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="160" who="S0262">are just questions I asked but the topic is entrepreneurs so I can't really say the topic is university students I would prefer to have something that's got a little bit more bite to it than that</u>
<u n="161" who="S0261" trans="overlap">the topic is education</u>
<u n="162" who="S0262">yeah the topic is education</u>
<u n="163" who="S0261">topic is learning topic is self-learning topic is self-directed learning topic is</u>
<u n="164" who="S0262"><vocal desc="yawn"/> alright I know I know what you are saying I am just saying thattopic like entrepreneurs is you know er big enough but small enough for it to be meaningful to people so people are I'm interested in entrepreneurs but it's quite a big it is quite a big area but actually it's big enough to break it up into small chunks</u>
<u n="165" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0262">which is what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s doing and I quite like this idea of the start-ups because it is big enough to break it up into small chunks</u>
<u n="167" who="S0261">part of the problem I have with it is <pause dur="short"/> that we are not in that space</u>
<u n="168" who="S0262">well what about if we put</u>
<u n="169" who="S0261" trans="overlap">we don't have we don't have we don't intrinsically have a track record that is enough to speak with authority</u>
<u n="170" who="S0262">yeah but also <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said that he would interview people so that he could <trunc>fi</trunc> he could learn from them</u>
<u n="171" who="S0261">yeah but what you didn't know until today is is that before he got into that he had built a forty million dollar company when he was twenty-three</u>
<u n="172" who="S0262">alright but what I am interested in is the topic that it is the mix of the people <pause dur="short"/> so it's start-ups for graduates or something start-ups for you know university students and graduates something like that so it is attached to the idea that we are looking at a much much younger demographic and maybe people who get involved in start-ups are in their early twenties</u>
<u n="173" who="S0261">oh they are <trunc>yo</trunc>you look around at a lot of the stories I'm listening to they're all twenties they're in their twenties</u>
<u n="174" who="S0262">well then start-ups is great because it's around the demographic we're interested in</u>
<u n="175" who="S0261">it is in the demographic where things do really kind of happen</u>
<u n="176" who="S0262">yeah so we could you know interview the the people from the shoes</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="177" who="S0261">I I'm quite attracted to their thing erm I the reason why first they are in <anon type="place"/> so you can connect them intrinsically with the community <pause dur="short"/> that they do appear to be outgoing because the guy runs his own blog talking about how they are going about building their own company</u>
<u n="178" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="179" who="S0261">and that he is now quite connected with er investors various <trunc>diff</trunc>different places yeah erm and he's probably a good <trunc>mo</trunc> they're probably good models for <pause dur="short"/> for for for erm young mentors for younger start-up people</u>
<u n="180" who="S0262">mm mm</u>
<u n="181" who="S0261">erm that they're still learning but they're a few steps ahead of where other people are going</u>
<u n="182" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="183" who="S0261" trans="overlap">so they are not miles ahead they are not angel investors they are not <pause dur="short"/> they are not old geezers they are not you know all of that you know <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> so yeah why not you can see them as being the people at the end and what you want to do is try to connect somebody at the start with those people</u>
<u n="184" who="S0262">yeah but it's fudging it</u>
<u n="185" who="S0261">well</u>
<u n="186" who="S0262">that's a really weird way of doing things</u>
<u n="187" who="S0261">do it backwards</u>
<u n="188" who="S0262">no I mean the people in <anon type="place"/> start-up people they could just be like the Tuesday or the Wednesday or the Thursday they are just people who are around to be interviewed that's where we are doing things differently is we are making a thread we are actually making a thread of conversations that have been had <pause dur="short"/> discussed <pause dur="short"/> and we're just basically telling it in a story format</u>
<u n="189" who="S0261">yeah okay I can run with that erm I haven't looked around the net erm at start-up types there must be <pause dur="short"/> oh there are heaps and heaps of groups for entrepreneurs and start-ups yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm in <anon type="place"/> and when I started looking at it probably two of them stood out and that's because they are international groups yeah so they're <pause dur="short"/> start-up Crunch or something like that or whatever erm Grind Start-up Grind and there's another one erm like The Big Think <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> they had the the highly populated things yeah <pause dur="short"/> you're tired</u>
<u n="190" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I am tired actually</u>
<u n="191" who="S0261">I know</u>
<u n="192" who="S0262">I was thinking how nice it would be to be tucked up in bed with a nice little cup of something hot</u>
<u n="193" who="S0261">mulled wine</u>
<u n="194" who="S0262">no <vocal desc="laugh"/> not like a mulled wine I was thinking perhaps something more like a peppermint tea or</u>
<u n="195" who="S0261"><vocal desc="yawn"/> oh</u>
<u n="196" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="197" who="S0261">but you get the point erm these communities er er are quite disparate there are several groups</u>
<u n="198" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0261" trans="overlap">people go to different groups erm talking to a couple of people last week they kind of go along to these things and say that sometimes they are a bit hit-and-miss</u>
<u n="200" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="201" who="S0261" trans="overlap">so you will get an element of people who go there just to be listeners</u>
<u n="202" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="203" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and they say they are going to do something but they are not doers and then you have got the real people who are doers who go there to network to find people to partner with yeah <pause dur="short"/> er you've got the sniffers you've got the er you've you've probably got the investors as well yeah</u>
<u n="204" who="S0262">well that's alright that's a networking session I don't mind that it is not a learning session though</u>
<u n="205" who="S0261">no but my point is if you join all that together as you're picking these people out of these groups within the groups the people know the people right so that's your niche that's your crowd</u>
<u n="206" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="207" who="S0261">and and then they can see well erm naturally these people get together and do this kind of networking solving problem stuff anyway</u>
<u n="208" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="209" who="S0261">it is just that it is all kind of kept together nobody is learning from it it is just their little bubble</u>
<u n="210" who="S0262">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="211" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and that's why they think it is all special because I'm all part of the team</u>
<u n="212" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="213" who="S0261">and everybody else is out there you know</u>
<u n="214" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="215" who="S0261">but</u>
<u n="216" who="S0262">it's a bit silly</u>
<u n="217" who="S0261" trans="overlap">but we are moving into a society where everybody is expected to be more open and transparent</u>
<u n="218" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="219" who="S0261">and with the way that information is spread anyway you can find out a hell of a lot without having a talk to these people in the first place</u>
<u n="220" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="221" who="S0261">so <pause dur="short"/> so what they can learn to help others along as they are doing it is very valuable</u>
<u n="222" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="223" who="S0261">and the start-up and tech community in <anon type="place"/> is starting to flourish yeah but these guys on the shoe thing were saying that four years ago it hardly existed <pause dur="short"/> yeah they had to work it out all themselves</u>
<u n="224" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it is interesting what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was saying about he sees the youth in <anon type="place"/> be the younger ones being a they're going to be a big part to play soon in <anon type="place"/> if not already maybe he needs people who are young enough to you know want to start up start-up companies and</u>
<u n="225" who="S0261">yeah well that's the way it is kind of working around the around the world erm and I bet that the people who are going forward here now have been watching what's been going on in the US for a long time yeah they simply <pause dur="short"/> appearing to be ahead of the game here now because they've been transporting models from America that have been covered five years ago <pause dur="short"/> yeah that's how long it has taken it has taken five years for the ideas there to come here</u>
<u n="226" who="S0262">bugger</u>
<u n="227" who="S0261">that's what I am seeing</u>
<u n="228" who="S0262">well yeah I mean you know fair enough erm</u>
<u n="229" who="S0261">it doesn't mean to say that you can't do anything it's just that</u>
<u n="230" who="S0262">I like it I like it as a topic I think it's it's it's a good way to at least run with something to start with I think we needed to define what we were going to run with</u>
<u n="231" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="232" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and I like it because I can see I could you know</u>
<u n="233" who="S0261">the potential is you're going to get a lot more positive stories out of it because of the nature of it being a start-up</u>
<u n="234" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="235" who="S0261">people will have an interest and try and make something go forward with progress</u>
<u n="236" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="237" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="238" who="S0262">erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah I think it could be quite good because even though what you are saying is that it is not necessarily I'm coming to you and with a problem and I need people to crowd to solve it together it could be I am coming here with an experience which I would like to further by sharing my story and people can add to my story by the very nature that they are social that they are social beings and that they will have input to what I am saying at some point</u>
<u n="239" who="S0261">I mean the nice idea for these people to become connected through <anon type="place"/> it maybe simply the storyline is connected that way so somebody A tells their story somebody B can <trunc>tac</trunc>tack onto that story because they've got the experience that goes beyond that and so on and so on</u>
<u n="240" who="S0262">I think I am going to have to call it there tonight</u>
<u n="241" who="S0261">okay that's there what's the time?</u>
<u n="242" who="S0262">I don't have the time lady</u>
<u n="243" who="S0261">the time old lady is quarter to nine</u>
