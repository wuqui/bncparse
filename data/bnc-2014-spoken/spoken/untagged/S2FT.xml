<u n="14" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's insane</u>

<u n="16" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> twenty-first <pause dur="short"/> bizarre</u>
<u n="17" who="S0179">see I treat spring as the start of March</u>
<u n="18" who="S0058">ha</u>
<u n="19" who="S0179">I do not conform to the <unclear/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0058" trans="overlap">sure</u>

<u n="27" who="S0179">no it's possible <pause dur="short"/> well I'd say that was actually useful knowledge</u>
<u n="28" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> doesn't really <trunc>mea</trunc> much make much difference what day they say spring starts on though</u>
<u n="29" who="S0179">hmm <pause dur="short"/> depends who you are <pause dur="short"/> it certainly makes a difference to some people</u>
<u n="30" who="S0058">hmm <pause dur="short"/> but I mean the world will continue on the way it's going even if you haven't given it a name</u>
<u n="31" who="S0179">yeah I'm just curious</u>
<u n="32" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0179">Cos I think it's a really sort of seasons are quite a <unclear/> quite a vague thing</u>
<u n="34" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think the thing is like there's some days which are really like this is the epitome of winter <pause dur="short"/> or this is the epitome of autumn <pause dur="short"/> but a lot of the time in England it's just a sort of ne somewhere in between things</u>
<u n="35" who="S0179">well just grey</u>
<u n="36" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so a bit grey and cold between autumn and winter and just a bit grey and not very exciting between spring and summer <pause dur="short"/> that kind of thing <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0058">so yeah <pause dur="short"/> seasons are sort of vague</u>

<u n="48" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="49" who="S0179" trans="overlap"><unclear/> away</u>
<u n="50" who="S0058">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's white <unclear/></u>
<u n="51" who="S0179">really <pause dur="short"/> how are people wearing so much today? And not being sort of</u>
<u n="52" who="S0058">hmm <pause dur="short"/> but he had his shorts on</u>
<u n="53" who="S0179">yeah okay <pause dur="short"/> I'll just go through there <pause dur="short"/> so should all sensible people</u>
<u n="54" who="S0058">hmm <pause dur="short"/> oh is this the <anon type="place"/> that the guy has a sign for? Or is it for the bathroom</u>
<u n="55" who="S0179">no but but that was fifty miles away</u>
<u n="56" who="S0058">yeah that's what I thought so yeah</u>

<u n="66" who="S0179">no I would like you to do it in the daylight please so you can actually see</u>
<u n="67" who="S0058">alright okay I'll do it tomorrow</u>
<u n="68" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so you don't get a chance to sort of do a crap job of it</u>
<u n="69" who="S0058">hmm</u>
<u n="70" who="S0179">or at least when you do a crap job of it I'll be able to <unclear/> no you shouldn't have done this job</u>
<u n="71" who="S0058">oh</u>
<u n="72" who="S0179">is that a challenge?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0058">what for me to? I'm not even sure what you'd be challenging <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="74" who="S0179">well I'm hoping that I've I say you're gonna do a bad job and you won't</u>
<u n="75" who="S0058">huh <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="76" who="S0179">just to prove me wrong</u>
<u n="77" who="S0058">yeah prove you wrong yeah</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="78" who="S0179"><unclear/> to check <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh sorry yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was miles away <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="80" who="S0179">yes you were</u>
<u n="81" who="S0058" trans="overlap">I was thinking about the erm there was a sign there for the sort of mini business park saying if you saw it it had sort of technical engineers or whatever</u>
<u n="82" who="S0179">yes I did</u>
<u n="83" who="S0058">it had a sign there saying vacancies <pause dur="short"/> you know and it kind of I thought oh like a B and B <pause dur="short"/> then I thought do they mean like job vacancies that they just have on a board outside?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="85" who="S0058" trans="overlap">that's quite odd</u>
<u n="86" who="S0179">it depends if they <unclear/> with the industry <pause dur="short"/> as in it depends sort of <unclear/> high tech firm and</u>
<u n="87" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> there was one that said there's precision engineers but I don't know exactly what that means</u>
<u n="88" who="S0179">well that could well be erm <unclear/></u>
<u n="89" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I guess that you know if you had a job like in a bar you'd just stick a notice in the window <pause dur="short"/> you know apply within so</u>
<u n="90" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0058">I guess no reason why not</u>
<u n="92" who="S0179">because it's a low cost means of advertising</u>
<u n="93" who="S0058">low cost?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0179">means of advertising</u>
<u n="95" who="S0058">well indeed yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's like us just sticking um posters round the faculties looking for recorders</u>
<u n="96" who="S0179">yes exactly</u>
<u n="97" who="S0058">actually I don't think we've got anyone out of that <pause dur="short"/> which I'm quite surprised <pause dur="short"/> I would have thought the students would have been keener</u>
<u n="98" who="S0179">well we don't want recorders do we <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0058">ha ha <pause dur="short"/> it's fine <pause dur="short"/> there's plenty <pause dur="short"/> but erm yeah I think most people read about it either on our on the CUP website or on like a um I think there was a couple of people who responded from</u>
<u n="100" who="S0179">or on where?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0058">on the  on the  <trunc>s</trunc> <anon type="place"/> website or on one of the um it was put up on the university websites</u>
<u n="102" who="S0179">oh okay</u>
<u n="103" who="S0058">I think we had it put up on <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> but yeah most people weren't students <pause dur="short"/> yeah I would have thought that they'd be really keen but yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0179">yeah?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0058">for that kind of thing you know the number of people who responded for the surveys and</u>
<u n="106" who="S0179">medical experiments</u>
<u n="107" who="S0058">well I think well I did a scientific study one where I had to um watch videos and kind of comments on things and I think it was to do with language acquisition or something <pause dur="short"/> so there was one where um I was shown pictures of things and I had to remember words and make links with things <pause dur="short"/> it was well you know it was quite interesting <pause dur="short"/> it was quite fun <pause dur="short"/> um and I was paid sort of a tenner for doing that</u>
<u n="108" who="S0179">okay</u>
<u n="109" who="S0058">well so it was quite good <pause dur="short"/> you know I I'd finished my exams and everything and it was like well you know I was there an hour or sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> and I I did a couple of <trunc>different</trunc> and when I was there they said ah and while you're here are you interested in doing another one <pause dur="short"/> it's easier than this one and we pay the same rate <pause dur="short"/> and I went yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0179">easier?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0058">well as in the first task was quite difficult I had to use my brain <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> for the second one I was told to watch a video and describe what happened <pause dur="short"/> and I think it was to do with the language I used to describe what I'd seen <pause dur="short"/> so whether I was saying there's a man or there was a man or it was or you know the the how what you know what kind of tense mood I was using so that was part of it</u>
<u n="112" who="S0179">interestingly I haven't there's not been a single car that I've seen on our side of the road</u>
<u n="113" who="S0058">what do they know that we don't?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0179">exactly</u>
<u n="115" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="116" who="S0179">there's not many in the other direction but there have been a few</u>
<u n="117" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0179">there is of course you you're travelling at a far higher relative speed so <pause dur="short"/> and in fact er <unclear/> relative speed <pause dur="short"/> cos we're probably only travelling at <unclear/> difference and maybe at the most ten miles an hour plus or minus to the vehicles in this direction</u>
<u n="119" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0179"><unclear/> travelling the relative speed of well over a hundred</u>
<u n="121" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="122" who="S0179">A hundred and thirty or so</u>
<u n="123" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="124" who="S0179">so a hundred and forty</u>
<u n="125" who="S0058" trans="overlap">obviously</u>
<u n="126" who="S0179">so like this is coming our direction but not on this road</u>
<u n="127" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0179">I wonder how long we can keep this up for</u>
<u n="129" who="S0058">what and not seeing one?</u>
<u n="130" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0058">well it's looking good</u>
<u n="132" who="S0179">ooh</u>
<u n="133" who="S0058">oh oh <pause dur="short"/> it couldn't last <pause dur="short"/> see they're like buses <pause dur="short"/> you wait ages and</u>
<u n="134" who="S0179" trans="overlap">well now the road's straightened out</u>
<u n="135" who="S0058">ah ha <pause dur="short"/> it could explain why</u>
<u n="136" who="S0179">one two <pause dur="short"/> these people say the roads are getting busier</u>
<u n="137" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> not this one <pause dur="short"/> is it really quiet? What day is it? Friday so I thought they'd be more people walking about</u>
<u n="138" who="S0179">if they had been anywhere I think they would be walking about</u>
<u n="139" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="140" who="S0179">what are they gonna build there?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0058">I don't know <unclear/> is it a?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0179">just a big man <unclear/></u>
<u n="143" who="S0058">interesting <pause dur="short"/> houses</u>
<u n="144" who="S0179">I don't think so</u>
<u n="145" who="S0058">will be taking over the world slowly but surely <pause dur="short"/> I wonder who the biggest house builder is</u>
<u n="146" who="S0179">um I think <unclear/></u>
<u n="147" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="long"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="148" who="S0179" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="149" who="S0058">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> They're certainly the most visible I think <pause dur="short"/> like I'd heard of them and I hadn't heard of <anon type="place"/> or of</u>
<u n="150" who="S0179"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="151" who="S0058"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="152" who="S0179"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="153" who="S0058">oh in my accent it would be <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> same as moor rather than moor <pause dur="short"/> ha</u>
<u n="154" who="S0179">oh okay</u>
<u n="155" who="S0058">I'm sure there's another one as well <pause dur="short"/> oh we were talking about you know like book and cook <pause dur="short"/> the fact that in some areas some people pronounce them book and cook</u>
<u n="156" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="157" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Just sort of comparing that</u>
<u n="158" who="S0179">so we haven't actually past any cars</u>
<u n="159" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="160" who="S0179">so <unclear/> is even up the road</u>
<u n="161" who="S0058">yes erm really hazy</u>

<u n="172" who="S0179">yes indeed</u>
<u n="173" who="S0058">like if they're being Sherlock Holmes or something</u>

<u n="191" who="S0058">I'm not sure I do <pause dur="short"/> I kind of get the <unclear/> round and I sort of get what's going on <pause dur="short"/> but then you extend it to cricket I've got no idea</u>
<u n="192" who="S0179">I know it's got overs and runs and</u>
<u n="193" who="S0058">yeah I don't know what I don't know how the scoring works <pause dur="short"/> so you have yeah something to something for something</u>
<u n="194" who="S0179" trans="overlap">I thought it was either six or twelve balls and over</u>

<u n="196" who="S0179">yeah but I don't know how any sort of I don't have any sense of how that relates to because you can continue batting for as long as you're not bowled out <pause dur="short"/> caught out</u>
<u n="197" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0179">so I don't see how overs come into that</u>

<u n="200" who="S0179">no you don't</u>
<u n="201" who="S0058">yeah</u>

<u n="210" who="S0179">yep <pause dur="short"/> like I said it's somewhere in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="211" who="S0058">oh</u>
<u n="212" who="S0179">but I don't know if it's actually anything else</u>
<u n="213" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure <pause dur="short"/> it rings a bell</u>
<u n="214" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="215" who="S0058">ah okay <pause dur="short"/> but yeah um the original owner of the Lords was called Lord</u>
<u n="216" who="S0179">sorry?</u>
<u n="217" who="S0058">the original owner was called Thomas Lord</u>
<u n="218" who="S0179">oh okay</u>
<u n="219" who="S0058">hence the name <pause dur="short"/> I didn't <pause dur="short"/> what I do know about cricket it mainly comes from the album um the Ducksworth  the Ducksworth  Lewis Method <pause dur="short"/> um which is a sort of novelty well so it's sort of a concept album all about cricket <pause dur="short"/> it's really good but it doesn't really tell you much about cricket</u>
<u n="220" who="S0179">who's the band?</u>
<u n="221" who="S0058">um the band is called The Ducksworth Lewis Method and I think the album's called that as well</u>
<u n="222" who="S0179" trans="overlap">no no no I I I'm not hearing what you're saying <unclear/></u>
<u n="223" who="S0058">Duckworth Lewis Method <pause dur="short"/> it's apparently it's a a rule or a sort of a weird doing another way of playing or a strategy for playing cricket I think</u>
<u n="224" who="S0179">right <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="225" who="S0058">and Duckworth Lewis must have been some figure</u>
<u n="226" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> I guessed that <pause dur="short"/> it could be a way of bowling I suppose</u>
<u n="227" who="S0058">yes I was thinking it's something like that <pause dur="short"/> um but yeah that's what the the band are named after after that <pause dur="short"/> and yeah I say band it was it's the guy you know the Divine Comedy</u>
<u n="228" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="229" who="S0058">it's him plus a few friends basically <pause dur="short"/> um sort of under another guise</u>
<u n="230" who="S0179">mm surely that constitutes a band <unclear/></u>
<u n="231" who="S0058">yeah exactly yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean <trunc>d</trunc> they're famous for other things <pause dur="short"/> so there's a guy from a band called Pugwash and but they came all together under this other banner to do this cricket album <pause dur="short"/> and it's really good</u>
<u n="232" who="S0179">well is it famous?</u>
<u n="233" who="S0058">yeah fair enough</u>
<u n="234" who="S0179">no as in you you might have to tell me who they are <unclear/></u>
<u n="235" who="S0058">Pugwash?</u>
<u n="236" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="237" who="S0058">um I don't have anything by them <pause dur="short"/> they're just a sort of just a a band <pause dur="short"/> I think fairly indie happy indies type stuff</u>
<u n="238" who="S0179">well that that description doesn't really help</u>
<u n="239" who="S0058">I I don't really know them very well very much</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="240" who="S0058">hmm <pause dur="short"/> tired cyclists by the looks of it</u>
<u n="241" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="242" who="S0058">some non-tired cyclists</u>
<u n="243" who="S0179">oh dear some florescent cyclists <pause dur="short"/> fortunately who are leaving this road</u>
<u n="244" who="S0058">hmm mm <pause dur="short"/> ha ha</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="245" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't mind dong a sort of er you know like a proper bike ride like a country bike ride</u>
<u n="246" who="S0179">well you'll have to do that by yourself</u>
<u n="247" who="S0058">hmm <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> no fancy for it?</u>
<u n="248" who="S0179">no bike</u>
<u n="249" who="S0058">no but you could hire a bike</u>
<u n="250" who="S0179">where from?</u>
<u n="251" who="S0058">A bike shop</u>
<u n="252" who="S0179">bike shops don't just hire bikes</u>
<u n="253" who="S0058">well how about a bike hire place <pause dur="short"/> lots of places hire bikes out</u>
<u n="254" who="S0179">where?</u>
<u n="255" who="S0058"><anon type="place"/> Hire Cycles <pause dur="short"/> sorry <anon type="place"/> Cycle Hire <pause dur="short"/> for a start if you want to do one there <pause dur="short"/> or where ever you're going they'll be <trunc>s</trunc> some you know you can go to a place where <pause dur="short"/> like that walk we went on had a bike hire place at each end</u>
<u n="256" who="S0179">oh right I thought you just meant randomly round the countryside</u>
<u n="257" who="S0058">not particularly <pause dur="short"/> you can also do that if you want to like at <anon type="place"/> Cycle Hire the point is that you can hire it for a week or a month or whatever <pause dur="short"/> that's why you see them parked er out and about quite a lot <pause dur="short"/> so kind of students who are on like a language programme or something often hire them <pause dur="short"/> and to be honest <trunc>th</trunc> that's their major market I think</u>
<u n="258" who="S0179">to be fair you can make up a second-hand bike so cheaply I'm surprised it's worth it</u>
<u n="259" who="S0058" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> true</u>
<u n="260" who="S0179">Cos then you can buy a bike for what? Twenty thirty quid</u>
<u n="261" who="S0058">I don't really know what the going rate is <pause dur="short"/> probably yeah <pause dur="short"/> it might not be very good <pause dur="short"/> I mean I think the the idea is that these are all really nice <pause dur="short"/> and I think yeah the <trunc>i</trunc> yeah sort of in people's heads if they're not gonna <trunc>u</trunc> keep something afterwards <pause dur="short"/> but no you're probably right it probably is <trunc>che</trunc> much cheaper just to er to buy one</u>
<u n="262" who="S0179">and then literally you could probably resell it at no loss</u>
<u n="263" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you can probably pick up something quite reasonable as well <pause dur="short"/> probably a decent enough range that you you probably get terrible bikes but I imagine you can pick up quite a nice one</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="264" who="S0058">okay?</u>
<u n="265" who="S0179">mm mm</u>
