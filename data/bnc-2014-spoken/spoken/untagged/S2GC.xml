<u n="1" who="S0144">okay what's the problem?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0024">right <pause dur="short"/> so well I was I'm just a bit confused really</u>
<u n="3" who="S0144">with what?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0024">right you've got to compare the examples of the academic text features here yeah? with this text</u>
<u n="5" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="6" who="S0024">and I it's</u>
<u n="7" who="S0144" trans="overlap">where does it say that?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0024" trans="overlap">really hard the <trunc>fir</trunc> that one</u>
<u n="9" who="S0144">mm?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0024">erm if you turn back to their self-study</u>
<u n="11" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0024" trans="overlap">it was erm find examples of these features in economic <unclear/> <trunc>mal</trunc> malaria in one point three</u>
<u n="13" who="S0144">oh really?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0024" trans="overlap">this one <pause dur="short"/> and it's really hard <pause dur="short"/> really hard</u>
<u n="15" who="S0144">oh I didn't do that</u>
<u n="16" who="S0024">so</u>
<u n="17" who="S0144">oh hang on I'd better get my book</u>
<u n="18" who="S0024"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="19" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0024">it's it's their self-study thing</u>
<u n="21" who="S0144" trans="overlap">oh where's my book?</u>
<u n="22" who="S0024" trans="overlap">but erm supposed to go over it in class but there must be so many examples of it <pause dur="short"/> what are you gonna do just go round the class and well yeah that that's an example of hedging yes that's an example</u>
<u n="23" who="S0144" trans="overlap">no you just have</u>
<u n="24" who="S0024" trans="overlap">or</u>
<u n="25" who="S0144" trans="overlap">to take one example <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0024">so basically an example of complexity they could read any sentence from this <pause dur="short"/> from this this faculty of writing and say that's an example of complexity</u>
<u n="27" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so I don't think you can spend much time with it</u>
<u n="28" who="S0024">explicitness</u>
<u n="29" who="S0144">oh I have got the AVU book sorry</u>
<u n="30" who="S0024"><vocal desc="gasp"/> yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> don't get excited</u>
<u n="32" who="S0024">well at least I can I was gonna thinking I was gonna have to go in really early</u>
<u n="33" who="S0144">no <pause dur="short"/> when are we gonna have dinner?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0024">I don't know I thought I would be done with this fairly quickly but it's taken longer than I thought</u>
<u n="35" who="S0144">right</u>
<u n="36" who="S0024">like</u>
<u n="37" who="S0144">er</u>
<u n="38" who="S0024">see to me I'm still confused hedging an argument I would say you you put you blame it on somebody else don't you?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0144">what?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0024">when you hedge an argument</u>
<u n="41" who="S0144">hedging is about <pause dur="short"/> how to strongly er state your case</u>
<u n="42" who="S0024">that's what it says here</u>
<u n="43" who="S0144">isn't it?</u>
<u n="44" who="S0024">well I always thought</u>
<u n="45" who="S0144">it's about your stance</u>
<u n="46" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="47" who="S0144">and how much you want to agree with some an argument <pause dur="short"/> cos maybe like say you've got argument X which you're in favour of <pause dur="short"/> the arguments that you use against that you're gonna kind of hedge it <pause dur="short"/> and you</u>
<u n="48" who="S0024" trans="overlap">and blame it on other people?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0144">well <vocal desc="laugh"/> not blame it on other people but make that argument weaker <pause dur="short"/> or make it <trunc>n</trunc> not put your</u>
<u n="50" who="S0024" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="51" who="S0144">voice into that argument <pause dur="short"/> make sure</u>
<u n="52" who="S0024" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="53" who="S0144">it's like someone else's point of view</u>
<u n="54" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0144" trans="overlap">and then you can rebut that</u>
<u n="56" who="S0024">economists believe okay here's a hedge yeah so it is it is what I thought but I didn't get the definition right properly</u>
<u n="57" who="S0144">yes <trunc>wha</trunc> which page is this?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0024">I'm on page thirteen <pause dur="short"/> so they've got economists believe that malaria is responsible for blah blah blah blah blah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0144">but where</u>
<u n="60" who="S0024">erm in</u>
<u n="61" who="S0144" trans="overlap">exactly?</u>
<u n="62" who="S0024">paragraph two so that's hedging it</u>
<u n="63" who="S0144" trans="overlap">hedging <pause dur="short"/> okay so that's hedging what were the other <unclear/></u>
<u n="64" who="S0024" trans="overlap">but <pause dur="short"/> I mean that's not saying that it's <pause dur="short"/> I mean to me <pause dur="short"/> you would then contrast that economists believe this but but it doesn't oh maybe that's not</u>
<u n="65" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah but with saying economists believe that's taking the power away from your answer</u>
<u n="66" who="S0024" trans="overlap">taking the power away <pause dur="short"/> yeah?</u>
<u n="67" who="S0144">it's setting up a rebuttal really isn't it saying that?</u>
<u n="68" who="S0024" trans="overlap">it is but they've not done a rebuttal</u>
<u n="69" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="70" who="S0024">have they?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0144">well it depends how you're <trunc>wha</trunc> <vocal desc="misc"/> the context of it</u>
<u n="72" who="S0024">okay</u>
<u n="73" who="S0144">I mean if if it's in the</u>
<u n="74" who="S0024" trans="overlap">does it</u>
<u n="75" who="S0144" trans="overlap">context of economists purely economists then that's a strong statement isn't it? economists believe that's assuming that all economists believe <pause dur="short"/> but if you're <trunc>ta</trunc> <trunc>ter</trunc> erm talking in terms of the world <pause dur="short"/> saying economists believe it's kind of weakening the argument because it's only one type of person</u>
<u n="76" who="S0024">so that's</u>
<u n="77" who="S0144" trans="overlap">who thinks that</u>
<u n="78" who="S0024" trans="overlap">say that second bit again</u>
<u n="79" who="S0144">mm?</u>
<u n="80" who="S0024">say the second bit again</u>
<u n="81" who="S0144">erm if you're assuming that you're talking about the whole world you're making a global statement</u>
<u n="82" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="83" who="S0144" trans="overlap">then it's weakening it so <pause dur="short"/> it it depends</u>
<u n="84" who="S0024">right okay</u>
<u n="85" who="S0144" trans="overlap">but yeah that's hedging <pause dur="short"/> it could be for or against your argument what were the other ones? <pause dur="short"/> yeah these have you done any of the others?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0024">right okay so complexity well you can choose any sentence can't you?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0144">well it's</u>
<u n="88" who="S0024" trans="overlap">but it's not saying that it's a complex sentence compared to a compound sentence is it? it's completely <trunc>diff</trunc> it's so confusing for them they've only just started academic English</u>
<u n="89" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0024">already they have to learn the difference between a complex and compound sentence and now they're learning or this guy here says that complexity <pause dur="short"/> er just means</u>
<u n="91" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="92" who="S0024" trans="overlap">a complicated sentence <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="93" who="S0144" trans="overlap">can you see anything? <pause dur="short"/> have you got an example of that?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0024">well any of them</u>
<u n="95" who="S0144">is there any subordinate clauses? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0024">oh okay then we can say it's a complex sentence</u>
<u n="97" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0024" trans="overlap">and it's a yeah but that might confuse them as well</u>
<u n="99" who="S0144">well what does <trunc>com</trunc> cos they don't need to know these words really <pause dur="short"/> it's not <trunc>re</trunc> it doesn't come in later does it to the course?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0024">no they have to write it not learn</u>
<u n="101" who="S0144" trans="overlap">not learn the words <pause dur="short"/> it's just metalanguage which is what they said not to do</u>
<u n="102" who="S0024">it's in the book</u>
<u n="103" who="S0144">erm more specific words and more sophisticated grammatical structures <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> stupid</u>
<u n="104" who="S0024" trans="overlap">well it could be any of them <pause dur="short"/> right it could be any of them right can you see an</u>
<u n="105" who="S0144" trans="overlap">okay well yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0024" trans="overlap">example of</u>
<u n="107" who="S0144" trans="overlap">could be anything</u>
<u n="108" who="S0024">of for er explicitness evidence explicitness?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0144">explicitness? <pause dur="long"/> well</u>
<u n="110" who="S0024">it's all</u>
<u n="111" who="S0144" trans="overlap">that's just a general thing isn't it?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0024">general</u>
<u n="113" who="S0144">saying it's explicit <pause dur="short"/> you can't point to a a phrase that's saying that shows explicitness</u>
<u n="114" who="S0024">well the exercise is find an example</u>
<u n="115" who="S0144">explicit well maybe an example then <pause dur="short"/> of up to one point three percent per year</u>
<u n="116" who="S0024">I was gonna use that as an example of precision</u>
<u n="117" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> well any of the statistics or examples show explicitness <pause dur="short"/> don't they? <pause dur="long"/> just giving more detail</u>
<u n="118" who="S0024">well it's in <trunc>s</trunc> explicit rather than implicit <pause dur="short"/> there's no hidden meanings it's just facts</u>
<u n="119" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0024">it's all just well oh</u>
<u n="121" who="S0144">okay well</u>
<u n="122" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I'm just thinking about all these questions they're gonna ask me</u>
<u n="123" who="S0144">well no it's great just get them I think looking at these words fuck that I'm gonna get them to find an example of hedging</u>
<u n="124" who="S0024">find an example of hedging okay I'll do that</u>
<u n="125" who="S0144" trans="overlap">and</u>
<u n="126" who="S0024">is there any more examples of hedging in there?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0144">I dunno but they <trunc>ye</trunc> whatever they shout out you can say yes or no</u>
<u n="128" who="S0024">oh yeah okay right find an example of see the accuracy one too I mean it could be any of them</u>
<u n="129" who="S0144" trans="overlap">anything</u>
<u n="130" who="S0024">anything <pause dur="short"/> and responsibility er</u>
<u n="131" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I'm gonna so I'm gonna skim over that responsibility? <pause dur="long"/> what the fuck? <pause dur="long"/> erm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0024">you must support any ideas that make and demonstrate what they have understand to source text that they have understood the source text</u>
<u n="133" who="S0144">objectivity</u>
<u n="134" who="S0024" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="135" who="S0144">as well could be anything <pause dur="short"/> it's all factual <pause dur="short"/> there's no personal opinion in there is there?</u>
<u n="136" who="S0024">no</u>
<u n="137" who="S0144">and it won't say <vocal desc="laugh"/> every sentence is objective</u>
<u n="138" who="S0024">which is what you want</u>
<u n="139" who="S0144">formality same thing</u>
<u n="140" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0144">yeah I think the only one</u>
<u n="142" who="S0024" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="143" who="S0144">er for the concrete example is hedging</u>
<u n="144" who="S0024">yeah now <pause dur="short"/> what</u>
<u n="145" who="S0144" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="146" who="S0024">what where are you starting this class?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0144">eh?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0024">where are you starting?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0144">erm <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I just had</u>
<u n="150" who="S0024" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="151" who="S0144" trans="overlap">had a quick look at it really <pause dur="short"/> erm students compare examples <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="152" who="S0024">compared to this table you see but we're not</u>
<u n="153" who="S0144">they're gonna write a load of stuff from there</u>
<u n="154" who="S0024">oh <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> so we just read the text?</u>
<u n="155" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0024">and then go to the AVU book?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0144">exercise two <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="158" who="S0024">we're not doing these exercises until after the break</u>
<u n="159" who="S0144">oh but they're reading the <pause dur="short"/> text</u>
<u n="160" who="S0024">oh</u>
<u n="161" who="S0144">well I might save those questions <pause dur="short"/> I must just look <trunc>ov</trunc></u>
<u n="162" who="S0024" trans="overlap">save that for later</u>
<u n="163" who="S0144">I'll save the hedging bit for later and go okay now we're on to this can you remember hedging from the first one?</u>
<u n="164" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0144">otherwise they're gonna end up reading the text again</u>
<u n="166" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0144">and it's just gonna</u>
<u n="168" who="S0024" trans="overlap">it's silly</u>
<u n="169" who="S0144" trans="overlap">confuse the hell out of them</u>
<u n="170" who="S0024" trans="overlap">okay so can I have a look at your AVU book? <pause dur="short"/> on page ten to eleven reviews</u>
<u n="171" who="S0144" trans="overlap">is that the next bit?</u>
<u n="172" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so that might be where we kind of start the class</u>
<u n="173" who="S0144">okay so then what is special about academic English? <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0024" trans="overlap">just wanna see what kind of exercises they didn't have to do that for homework did they?</u>
<u n="175" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0024">oh they did do AVU for homework then?</u>
<u n="177" who="S0144">erm let me just take a quick look yes so <pause dur="short"/> I mean good luck with that I don't know what to do with that <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="178" who="S0024">you've got the answers</u>
<u n="179" who="S0144">yeah they're easy</u>
<u n="180" who="S0024">oh are they? I'm gonna have to go in early and just check things over cos I've forgotten my book this is the problem with working from home I forget things and leave them at work</u>
<u n="181" who="S0144">well just keep all your stuff in your bag</u>
<u n="182" who="S0024">yeah I didn't have the AVU book I but</u>
<u n="183" who="S0144">erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah the answers are easy for that but I dunno what to do about that page <vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm gonna read it <pause dur="short"/> it's like what the fuck? <pause dur="long"/> I haven't got</u>
<u n="184" who="S0024" trans="overlap">but they should have read that for homework</u>
<u n="185" who="S0144">yeah but we've got gotta go through it for twenty minutes</u>
<u n="186" who="S0024">reviews A B and C oh okay reviews A B and C</u>
<u n="187" who="S0144">well what I was gonna get actually <pause dur="short"/> oh no that <trunc>wa</trunc> maybe put them get do microteaching <pause dur="short"/> where one of them is the teacher and explains what it's about <pause dur="short"/> and then for B the next student can explain what that one's about</u>
<u n="188" who="S0024">groups of three <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0144">that might work <pause dur="short"/> cos I I'm not gonna stand up there and like and go through all of that</u>
<u n="190" who="S0024">oh no</u>
<u n="191" who="S0144">get them to explain it to each other <pause dur="short"/> mm?</u>
<u n="192" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="193" who="S0144">that's the only way to do it</u>
<u n="194" who="S0024">we don't have to have a Powerpoint for this do we?</u>
<u n="195" who="S0144">no there's no there's nothing</u>
<u n="196" who="S0024">I just need to jot this down on <pause dur="short"/> my Powerpoint</u>
<u n="197" who="S0144">yeah so yeah do that for twenty minutes go through the answers</u>
<u n="198" who="S0024">microteaching <pause dur="short"/> groups of three</u>
<u n="199" who="S0144">mm <pause dur="short"/> maybe not even go through this answers on the next page <pause dur="short"/> cos that's just gonna be tedious as well</u>
<u n="200" who="S0024">yeah no they can</u>
<u n="201" who="S0144">they can check just</u>
<u n="202" who="S0024" trans="overlap">does this</u>
<u n="203" who="S0144" trans="overlap">check each other's work</u>
<u n="204" who="S0024" trans="overlap">correspondent A and number one?</u>
<u n="205" who="S0144">er don't know</u>
<u n="206" who="S0024" trans="overlap">everyday words</u>
<u n="207" who="S0144">I think so yeah</u>
<u n="208" who="S0024">one point two</u>
<u n="209" who="S0144">yeah it's about words which are used generally and then the same type of the word is used</u>
<u n="210" who="S0024" trans="overlap"><unclear>fingertips</unclear></u>
<u n="211" who="S0144">academically <pause dur="short"/> like focus the camera or the focus of the essay it's the different meaning of the word focus</u>
<u n="212" who="S0024" trans="overlap">oh my god I remember this I'm sure I've got a type out of this</u>
<u n="213" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean it's it fairly easy</u>
<u n="214" who="S0024">ah</u>
<u n="215" who="S0144">but if they've done it for homework it's gonna like oh twenty minutes of boredom <pause dur="short"/> hopefully they'll have made some mistakes and then I've got something to talk about okay?</u>
<u n="216" who="S0024">okay</u>
<u n="217" who="S0144" trans="overlap">shall we move on?</u>
<u n="218" who="S0024">erm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="219" who="S0144">so we're using three different books tomorrow</u>
<u n="220" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="221" who="S0144">this making connections is bloody shit <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's it's a crap lesson so far</u>
<u n="222" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="223" who="S0144" trans="overlap">isn't it? but you wait till you get to this bit</u>
<u n="224" who="S0024">oh man <pause dur="long"/> these core <unclear>first</unclear> students can develop er strategies to acquire academic what strategy which strategies? to acquire this</u>
<u n="225" who="S0144" trans="overlap">to acquire what? vocabulary?</u>
<u n="226" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="227" who="S0144">okay I was just gonna brainstorm ideas make a vocabulary notebook put up a model example on the board <pause dur="short"/> where you've got the words you've got where the what part of speech is erm</u>
<u n="228" who="S0024" trans="overlap">the one from the listening and speaking exercise?</u>
<u n="229" who="S0144">no I'm just gonna make my own up just draw it on the board and then write the word in context</u>
<u n="230" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="231" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="232" who="S0024">academic</u>
<u n="233" who="S0144" trans="overlap">and what else?</u>
<u n="234" who="S0024" trans="overlap">vocabulary</u>
<u n="235" who="S0144">tell them as well to <pause dur="short"/> with vocabulary <pause dur="short"/> to learn it in you know and sometimes it's good learning it in groups</u>
<u n="236" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="237" who="S0144">like lexical sets instead of just lists</u>
<u n="238" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="239" who="S0144">things like that and not to try and learn big groups of words like seven words at a time is is a good chunk</u>
<u n="240" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="long"/> so</u>
<u n="241" who="S0144" trans="overlap">anyway and then once they and don't just write them in their books cos this is what they do they do write them in their book and then forget about it</u>
<u n="242" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="243" who="S0144">what they've got to do is write it in their book and then try and use it in everyday language</u>
<u n="244" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="245" who="S0144">so they give themselves a challenge to to try and use those like words like during the course of the day <pause dur="short"/> and then use them the next day as well</u>
<u n="246" who="S0024">what academically? what</u>
<u n="247" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="248" who="S0024" trans="overlap">while they're discussing homework and stuff?</u>
<u n="249" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I think this is the way to</u>
<u n="250" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="251" who="S0144" trans="overlap">learn vocabulary and then and then use it the next week and then use it again within the next two weeks then with them the next month and then that's the only way to get it to stick <pause dur="short"/> otherwise they'll just be writing these words and they</u>
<u n="252" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="253" who="S0144">they forget them so some strategies like that <pause dur="short"/> just ask them how to do you learn vocabulary? so that they can't <trunc>re</trunc></u>
<u n="254" who="S0024">yeah I might start the class with that a big brainstorm</u>
<u n="255" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="256" who="S0024">okay <pause dur="short"/> big brainstorm number one brainstorm <pause dur="short"/> strategies <pause dur="short"/> do then the microteaching of this AVU <pause dur="long"/> you've got the answers in the back of this yeah?</u>
<u n="257" who="S0144">erm don't know</u>
<u n="258" who="S0024">oh <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> can I just check?</u>
<u n="259" who="S0144">uhu</u>
<u n="260" who="S0024">yeah answers are in the back</u>
<u n="261" who="S0144">okay <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="262" who="S0024">okay so I'll get somebody to <pause dur="short"/> be <pause dur="short"/> teacher for each of them <pause dur="short"/> and I'll just go round and answer questions right?</u>
<u n="263" who="S0144">so you're gonna get someone to explain that</u>
<u n="264" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="265" who="S0144">and then they and then they can check their answers for that</u>
<u n="266" who="S0024">I'm not sure they</u>
<u n="267" who="S0144" trans="overlap">and then do that with that</u>
<u n="268" who="S0024" trans="overlap">correspondent perfectly</u>
<u n="269" who="S0144">oh I don't they?</u>
<u n="270" who="S0024" trans="overlap">do you think?</u>
<u n="271" who="S0144">I dunno maybe treat it separately then <pause dur="short"/> do each page separately</u>
<u n="272" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="273" who="S0144">okay next</u>
<u n="274" who="S0024">these more formal <pause dur="short"/> alright oh right it does more formal yeah noun phrases <pause dur="short"/> underline two verbs with adverbs after them okay <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="long"/> okay they do kind of correspond</u>
<u n="275" who="S0144">yeah so you could get them</u>
<u n="276" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="277" who="S0144">to do one at a time</u>
<u n="278" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="279" who="S0144">explain it and then check the answers <pause dur="short"/> the teacher checks the answers at the back</u>
<u n="280" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0144">and then yeah okay right come on then</u>
<u n="282" who="S0024">alright er have that erm making connections</u>
<u n="283" who="S0144">okay you have to go to page two three nine</u>
<u n="284" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="285" who="S0144">so this is about reading <pause dur="short"/> and basically not stopping</u>
<u n="286" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="287" who="S0144" trans="overlap">every time you read trying to understand the words you don't know through the context</u>
<u n="288" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="289" who="S0144">yeah? erm so <pause dur="short"/> again I think it's gonna have to be <trunc>m</trunc> er microteaching <pause dur="short"/> cos this is just you can't stand up there and go through this stuff the first two <pause dur="short"/> I mean you can go through the strategies maybe</u>
<u n="290" who="S0024">the and they've done this for homework?</u>
<u n="291" who="S0144">yeah they've done the whole class for homework <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="292" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="293" who="S0144" trans="overlap">we're just checking their homework erm</u>
<u n="294" who="S0024">okay</u>
<u n="295" who="S0144">so just got to practice one or two just personal opinions so</u>
<u n="296" who="S0024" trans="overlap">you got answers?</u>
<u n="297" who="S0144">this is personal opinion</u>
<u n="298" who="S0024">oh</u>
<u n="299" who="S0144">they just choose what's most suitable for them <pause dur="short"/> whether they generally understand it or <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="300" who="S0024">alright <pause dur="short"/> I never heard of something called a <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> what so they've done that at home and we don't have to check it then?</u>
<u n="301" who="S0144">no not one and two but three</u>
<u n="302" who="S0024">erm</u>
<u n="303" who="S0144">and four we do <pause dur="long"/> yeah so three <pause dur="short"/> erm yeah they've gotta look at the word <pause dur="short"/> and look at the paragraph and try and guess what that word means just from</u>
<u n="304" who="S0024">ah</u>
<u n="305" who="S0144" trans="overlap">the context</u>
<u n="306" who="S0024">yes</u>
<u n="307" who="S0144">without looking at the dictionary</u>
<u n="308" who="S0024">okay</u>
<u n="309" who="S0144">and do that with their words</u>
<u n="310" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="311" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm and then number four <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> it's the same thing isn't it?</u>
<u n="312" who="S0024">so we're just discussing</u>
<u n="313" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="314" who="S0024">in pairs what they thought the word meant?</u>
<u n="315" who="S0144">is that the same thing?</u>
<u n="316" who="S0024">er <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>learning</unclear> short text <unclear>scrimping</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> unit one reading four</u>
<u n="317" who="S0144">it's the same activity but just based on a different reading</u>
<u n="318" who="S0024">use these strategies for <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="319" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="320" who="S0024">okay</u>
<u n="321" who="S0144">so three and four are the same</u>

<u n="323" who="S0144">eh?</u>
<u n="324" who="S0024">discuss <pause dur="short"/> what I bet they've all translated it I bet they've all</u>
<u n="325" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="326" who="S0024">done it and then translated it</u>
<u n="327" who="S0144">I bet they just looked at it in the dictionary <pause dur="short"/> and wrote the definition</u>
<u n="328" who="S0024">so what are you gonna do with them if they've done that?</u>
<u n="329" who="S0144">I dunno I wish I hadn't said to do it for homework</u>
<u n="330" who="S0024">mm me too</u>
<u n="331" who="S0144">it's stupid isn't it? <pause dur="short"/> in fact I'm gonna stop doing that</u>
<u n="332" who="S0024">well no the readings they have to do</u>
<u n="333" who="S0144">oh some of them they're the I mean this could have easily <trunc>d</trunc> just been done in class would have been much better <pause dur="short"/> for them to do it in class</u>
<u n="334" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="335" who="S0144">okay so then it's break yeah?</u>

<u n="339" who="S0144">yeah crap eh? and then after the break more online resources introduce students to online dictionaries and thesauruses</u>
<u n="340" who="S0024" trans="overlap">we did that already</u>
<u n="341" who="S0144">yeah and who uses online dictionaries these days?</u>
<u n="342" who="S0024">I do <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="343" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah we do <pause dur="short"/> but students have got their apps on their phones <pause dur="short"/> so I mean they don't it's kind of redundant <pause dur="short"/> they I mean and we've got ten minutes <pause dur="short"/> to tell them to use a dictionary which we already done last week</u>
<u n="344" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="345" who="S0144">so</u>
<u n="346" who="S0024">Onelook dot com? never seen that</u>

<u n="351" who="S0144">yeah but have you seen it?</u>
<u n="352" who="S0024" trans="overlap">one point three no let me see they've got to do this vocabulary thing yeah?</u>
<u n="353" who="S0144">I tell you what it's an awful lesson for them</u>
<u n="354" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I'm gonna brainstorm malaria <pause dur="short"/> vocabulary</u>
<u n="355" who="S0144">brainstorm on the board yeah?</u>
<u n="356" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="357" who="S0144">uhu</u>

<u n="359" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="360" who="S0024">maybe I'll take loads of pens and they can just in their groups on their tables</u>
<u n="361" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="362" who="S0024">there's three tables they can write as many as they can <pause dur="short"/> words to do with malaria what do you think?</u>
<u n="363" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah and then bring it together in the class</u>
<u n="364" who="S0024">er maybe get some large sheets of paper</u>
<u n="365" who="S0144">ah got time for that <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> page twelve to fourteen so yeah that's that one <pause dur="short"/> erm exercise two <pause dur="short"/> is where we go back and mention this hedging thing read through the text to get them to read it out loud</u>
<u n="366" who="S0024">read aloud you didn't do?</u>
<u n="367" who="S0144">well yeah just to well for the time we're so short of time <pause dur="short"/> you know what I mean so much spare time</u>

<u n="369" who="S0144">erm</u>
<u n="370" who="S0024">yeah I know they say that this course is packed but actually if you did it if you do it efficiently it's not</u>
<u n="371" who="S0144"><pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="372" who="S0024">it depends on their understanding I suppose</u>
<u n="373" who="S0144">okay so they've gotta try and determine what the words mean that they don't know</u>
<u n="374" who="S0024">okay so that's what they did in <pause dur="short"/> in AVU</u>
<u n="375" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="376" who="S0024">same as AVU</u>
<u n="377" who="S0144">same thing</u>
<u n="378" who="S0024">but they do it in class</u>
<u n="379" who="S0144">erm and then maybe if okay we so we've oh here it is exercise three so four of the unknown words they have to write it down <pause dur="short"/> and then without using the dictionary this is the key thing <pause dur="short"/> so when you when they <vocal desc="laugh"/> get to read it don't <vocal desc="laugh"/> use a dictionary but they would've <trunc>al</trunc>already done it for homework</u>
<u n="380" who="S0024">well they're keen at the moment aren't they? so they're they're jumping ahead a lot</u>
<u n="381" who="S0144">I should never have said</u>

<u n="526" who="S0144">mm okay that'll take what? ten minutes?</u>
<u n="527" who="S0024">use a different form of the word well what if their word was malaria?</u>
<u n="528" who="S0144">yeah that's that's why I said <pause dur="short"/> it had to be words like <pause dur="short"/> costs and account for <trunc>acc</trunc> account <pause dur="short"/> words which have a double meaning but there's there isn't really any in there but they'd never get that</u>

<u n="531" who="S0024"><pause dur="short"/> if they say I don't know the meaning of economists okay that's your <pause dur="short"/> your word and then you change it to economy and you write a sentence <pause dur="short"/> that's fine but</u>
<u n="532" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="533" who="S0024">really? so <trunc>ju</trunc> so this is what?</u>
<u n="534" who="S0144">use a different form of the word if possible</u>
<u n="535" who="S0024">disease</u>

<u n="541" who="S0024">any four unknown words</u>
<u n="542" who="S0144">oh <pause dur="short"/> but they've done that already here meaning <pause dur="short"/> what do you think it means</u>

<u n="553" who="S0024" trans="overlap">backwards isn't it?</u>
<u n="554" who="S0144">it doesn't it's badly written <pause dur="short"/> so you say change the word but make sure <vocal desc="laugh"/> I no I'm just gonna say keep the same word just write it in another sentence <pause dur="short"/> if that's the word they don't know that's the word they need to practice but they could just end up writing completely different words</u>
<u n="555" who="S0024">I suppose if they choose any general <pause dur="short"/> general academic vocabularies you can</u>
<u n="556" who="S0144">okay so say they choose accounts</u>
<u n="557" who="S0024">accountable</u>
<u n="558" who="S0144">the disease may account for okay so they look up account a financial thing so <vocal desc="laugh"/> they've got their sentence about some financial service <pause dur="short"/> that's just confusing them</u>
<u n="559" who="S0024">well they should be looking at the context anyway</u>
