<u n="167" who="S0057" trans="overlap">but it's just the fact that yeah the little polo didn't make it well nearly didn't make it <pause dur="short"/> so now he doesn't want to take anything else up <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="168" who="S0058" trans="overlap">just paranoia <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> found out <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> lives really close to <anon type="place"/></u>
