<u n="301" who="S0338"><trunc>noth</trunc>nothing's come our way that would be nice if they did</u>

<u n="310" who="S0338" trans="overlap">oh I'd like to buy that car</u>
<u n="311" who="S0336">a lot of the deals and stuff that you get are from you going in and like</u>

<u n="317" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="318" who="S0339">well this is this is the point you've got to remember that the deals you get go back to what Hyundai have passed the car onto their dealership for cos the Hyundai have got to make that mark up</u>
<u n="319" who="S0336">mm</u>
<u n="320" who="S0339">the dealership have got to make a mark up there</u>
<u n="321" who="S0338">oh so you're buying it there</u>
<u n="322" who="S0339">and in fact what you're technically buying <unclear/> is there</u>
<u n="323" who="S0338" trans="overlap">is there</u>
<u n="324" who="S0339">not the dealership</u>
<u n="325" who="S0338">but dealers dealerships are gonna disappear they're shafting their own dealers</u>
<u n="326" who="S0336" trans="overlap">well dealerships <unclear/> Hyundai <unclear/> one was they were selling the car for cheaper that it was on Hyundai</u>
<u n="327" who="S0337" trans="overlap">good yeah they have good deals</u>
<u n="328" who="S0336">I don't know how but they were</u>
<u n="329" who="S0338">well cos they have to</u>
<u n="330" who="S0336">but then actually that was through a finance deal so obviously they were making money on the <unclear/></u>
<u n="331" who="S0338" trans="overlap">on the finance</u>
<u n="332" who="S0339" trans="overlap"><unclear/> they're making they're making their money on there</u>

<u n="334" who="S0339" trans="overlap">sorry this this was sorry so yeah this was just straight figures boom nothing</u>
<u n="335" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah <unclear/> buying a car</u>
<u n="336" who="S0339">so of course if if Hyundai say a car is worth well round figures a lot lower <unclear/> ten grand that's what we need to sell it to make our profit</u>
<u n="337" who="S0338">mm mm</u>
<u n="338" who="S0339">well for the dealership to make a profit on it forgetting any add ons they might want they've got to sell it for twelve</u>
<u n="339" who="S0336" trans="overlap">a couple of grand more yeah</u>
<u n="340" who="S0338">mm</u>
<u n="341" who="S0339">and so you go in and if you twist and oh well yeah well I'll pop that on and I'll put this on <vocal desc="cough"/> and all of a sudden it comes down to eleven</u>
<u n="342" who="S0338">mm mm</u>
<u n="343" who="S0339">but then by the time you've added all the extras on it's back up to <trunc>tw</trunc> but they've then got all the commission on</u>
<u n="344" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="345" who="S0339">gap <unclear>insurance</unclear> you've had</u>

<u n="1027" who="S0338">cos they know her that well but she's okay with him</u>
<u n="1028" who="S0336">but it is hard I think with with animals trying to introduce them to new situations it is difficult you have to try and do as much as you can when they're puppies so they get really acclimatised to it</u>
<u n="1029" who="S0338">well</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0337">yeah</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0338">there's definitely a pecking order there</u>

<u n="1033" who="S0337">no that doesn't matter that actually doesn't matter</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0338">but if a baby came in it would happen then</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0336">yeah I I think if they</u>
<u n="1036" who="S0337" trans="overlap">they should it's not about pecking order either</u>
<u n="1037" who="S0336">no</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0338">no</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0337">it's about the first couple of months of the puppies life you need to have them</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0336">with different dogs with different <unclear>parents</unclear> different <unclear/></u>
<u n="1041" who="S0337" trans="overlap">yeah different different people</u>
<u n="1042" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0337">and then pecking order shouldn't come into it</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0338">right</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0337">they should just be familiar</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0338" trans="overlap">gregarious</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="1048" who="S0338">yeah</u>
<u n="1049" who="S0337">erm cos you know the whole pecking order thing?</u>
<u n="1050" who="S0338">mm mm</u>
<u n="1051" who="S0337">they say they say I don't know who they are erm that the experiment about pecking order came from when whoever it was whichever scientist it was put a load of walls together to to monitor it</u>
<u n="1052" who="S0338" trans="overlap">right yeah</u>
<u n="1053" who="S0337">and they chose walls from different families and just put them together so there was huge fights until a pecking order was was erm established</u>
<u n="1054" who="S0338" trans="overlap">established uhu</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0337">a bit like there is with with birds and chickens for example but when you monitor actual families actual blood related wolves that doesn't happen</u>
<u n="1056" who="S0338">right</u>
<u n="1057" who="S0337">and you have an alpha male and a female but there's no there's no real pecking order because they just know they're just familiar</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0338">everyone's looked after equally</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0337">they're born into it</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0338">yeah</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0337">so if you get a puppy that's born into these situations</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0338">yeah</u>

<u n="1068" who="S0338">yeah brilliant</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0337" trans="overlap">which makes sense</u>
