<u n="1" who="S0421">cos I like English language but I feel like I might be able to do English language <pause dur="short"/> on my own</u>
<u n="2" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="3" who="S0421">I don't I feel like maybe I don't need a teacher for it I could probably</u>
<u n="4" who="S0423" trans="overlap">oh look there's where I work</u>
<u n="5" who="S0421">oh mm</u>
<u n="6" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well not in there but</u>
<u n="7" who="S0421">I could probably just read the books <pause dur="short"/> erm and get a good knowledge</u>
<u n="8" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="9" who="S0421">and I mean you know like that that's kind of like the same with creative writing but like I <trunc>wou</trunc> I could do that at home <pause dur="short"/> but erm be alright to do like a for the first year if I've got to do something might be quite good fun</u>
<u n="10" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0421">but like French I couldn't really carry on that by myself because I'm not a good enough standard</u>
<u n="12" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0421">so like it's my extra subjects I should probably pick something <pause dur="short"/> that I will benefit from from having a <pause dur="short"/> a guided thing</u>
<u n="14" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="15" who="S0421">cos there's lots of books on English language and I feel like if I read those I'd be alright doing it myself <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0423">yeah it would be good to <pause dur="short"/> kind of link it in to a related subject wouldn't it? to what you're studying <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="17" who="S0421">and if I was studying it myself when I'm in the English department anyway and I had some kind of a question that I didn't understand something I'm sure there'd be someone there to help me</u>
<u n="18" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="19" who="S0421">and they have like erm you can do like world literature <pause dur="short"/> along with English literature but I don't really wanna do that because it's not like <pause dur="short"/> I don't know it sounded quite interesting but I don't think I want to do it it's like</u>
<u n="20" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="21" who="S0421">erm Greek like I don't know what they do like</u>
<u n="22" who="S0423">what from like classics?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0421">yeah I think so maybe not quite classics cos they do have a separate classics course</u>
<u n="24" who="S0423">oh I thought it would be er more modern world literature</u>
<u n="25" who="S0421">no yeah it's like that old stuff</u>
<u n="26" who="S0423">oh right</u>
<u n="27" who="S0421" trans="overlap">it kind of broadens your knowledge of like yeah I suppose like classical things it's not quite classics though because in classics</u>
<u n="28" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well going back to older like</u>
<u n="29" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0423">literature</u>
<u n="31" who="S0421">yeah in different countries because in classics you <trunc>ac</trunc>actually like learn the different languages and things and about culture and things so maybe it's just <unclear>not</unclear> that aspect</u>
<u n="32" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="33" who="S0421">I would have quite liked to do maybe something like philosophy but I don't know what I'd do with philosophy and again that's something that I could do in my own time really</u>
<u n="34" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0421">cos I could just read I could read there's lots of books on philosophy that I could do</u>
<u n="36" who="S0423">you could become a full time philosopher</u>
<u n="37" who="S0421">yeah cos there's lots of work for full time philosophers</u>
<u n="38" who="S0423"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="39" who="S0421">philosophising all day</u>
<u n="40" who="S0423" trans="overlap">is there a lot of work for English literature students? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0421">of course there is</u>
<u n="42" who="S0423">is there?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0421" trans="overlap">because you can go into anything</u>
<u n="44" who="S0423">like what?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0421">like <trunc>Engli</trunc> well anything that's not science and you can just get additional training for anything but like to be a philosopher like</u>
<u n="46" who="S0423">well philosophers in theory should be able to go into anything as well</u>
<u n="47" who="S0421">well yeah if you do a philosophy degree</u>
<u n="48" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0421" trans="overlap">but you said you could become a full time <trunc>philosoph</trunc> there's like no work for that at all</u>
<u n="50" who="S0423"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="51" who="S0421">like there's no there's</u>
<u n="52" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well if you're good at it and old books then</u>
<u n="53" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="54" who="S0423">I mean there's been somebody on TV who's a <trunc>pai</trunc> a paid full time philosopher</u>
<u n="55" who="S0421">yeah there's like one or two in like</u>
<u n="56" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0421">the world <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="58" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0421" trans="overlap">I don't think students who go and do a philosophy degree are planning to go into being a full time philosopher <pause dur="short"/> they'll probably</u>
<u n="60" who="S0423">well how do philosophers come about then? they must start somewhere</u>
<u n="61" who="S0421">yeah well may may I think</u>
<u n="62" who="S0423" trans="overlap">just cos we're in the modern world and we think we know everything doesn't mean <unclear>there's no</unclear> <unclear/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0421" trans="overlap">no but yeah there are loads of modern philosophers but the thing is those philosophers probably don't just philosophise all day so like yeah they'll have a book but they'll also do like I dunno research and they'll probably</u>
<u n="64" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well they probably teach don't they?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah they probably teach they <trunc>prob</trunc> they might even be interested in history as well do you know what I mean? they they're not just like sitting round like oh <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> philosophising all the time</u>
<u n="66" who="S0423">that would be good that that would be a good job</u>
<u n="67" who="S0421">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah there were loads of modern philosophy books not just all the old ones</u>
<u n="68" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0421">but you wouldn't be I don't think it would be very rare for someone to be able to live on that full time <vocal desc="laugh"/> I mean how many people are buying philosophy books?</u>
<u n="70" who="S0423">mm yeah they have to do other things wouldn't they?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0421">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I think yeah so like I yeah if you did philosophy you could probably it isn't I think in terms of kind of job prospects people might kind of recognise English a bit more than philosophy</u>
<u n="72" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0421">in terms of like employability even though like English <pause dur="short"/> isn't like necessarily gonna be used for the job specifically but English is like a good one a lot of people do it if they don't know what they want to do because</u>
<u n="74" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0421">but I'm doing it cos I like English</u>
<u n="76" who="S0423">well I suppose it demonstrates your level of intelligence if</u>
<u n="77" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0423" trans="overlap">you have a degree in most things doesn't it? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="79" who="S0421">well philosophy is kind of quite useful to have like a bit of a knowledge for it cos sometimes I've read books and like I don't understand them because they're like philosophical novels</u>
<u n="80" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0421">and they've got like theories and things in them and I'm just I just don't understand them because I don't know anything about them like I read some Camus and I didn't I didn't realise that he was like I just read it and I was like wow this is a weird book</u>
<u n="82" who="S0423">who?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0421">Camus</u>
<u n="84" who="S0423">I don't know is he a philosopher?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0421" trans="overlap">do you not? yeah well he writes like philosophical fiction</u>
<u n="86" who="S0423">oh right</u>
<u n="87" who="S0421">I don't know if he's got any actual like the pure philosophy things but yeah erm he's quite like</u>
<u n="88" who="S0423" trans="overlap">sounds quite interesting</u>
<u n="89" who="S0421" trans="overlap">existential <pause dur="short"/> yeah I read er The Stranger or The Outsider it depends he's French <pause dur="short"/> I didn't</u>
<u n="90" who="S0423" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="91" who="S0421" trans="overlap">read it in French though <vocal desc="laugh"/> just read it in English and I I remember I finished reading it and I was like I don't really understand <pause dur="short"/> where this book was going or what it was trying to show or anything</u>
<u n="92" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0421" trans="overlap">cos it was really short and it was just really strange like well the story wasn't that strange but I don't know and I I didn't really understand it and I feel like if I read it again and read it up a bit more about like some theories that he was trying to employ I think I'd understand it better</u>
<u n="94" who="S0423" trans="overlap">what was he was he coming up with some philosophical ideas which was the theory of some philosopher which is a recognised theory <pause dur="short"/> or was he just making his own stuff up?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0421">no I think it's like because there are like different types of philosophers and I think <pause dur="short"/> because with the thing in like because it's fiction it's not kind of like erm like theories like written out it's kind of incorporated into the story</u>
<u n="96" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0421">and he's quite existential so within existentialism it's erm <pause dur="short"/> like about being and well you know like existence like what why are we why do we exist like?</u>
<u n="98" who="S0423">so do you have to understand a bit about that philosophy to understand the book?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0421" trans="overlap">I think so yeah because I mean I kind of like even now knowing a bit more about cos I did I did some research and I do know a bit more about the different branches and things but it's I mean I have to reread the book cos I can't really remember it that well now but even with knowing that I think I'm still kind of thinking about thinking back to the book like not quite sure what he was doing I think I'd have to read it again</u>
<u n="100" who="S0423">I've read er Voltaire</u>
<u n="101" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0423">one of his novels</u>
<u n="103" who="S0421">did you?</u>
<u n="104" who="S0423" trans="overlap">and he's like a philosophical writer</u>
<u n="105" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0423">isn't he?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0423">yeah but going way back</u>
<u n="109" who="S0421" trans="overlap">did you</u>
<u n="110" who="S0423" trans="overlap">to</u>
<u n="111" who="S0421" trans="overlap">understand it?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0423">no</u>
<u n="113" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="114" who="S0423">so I didn't <pause dur="short"/> you know I don't I don't know whether I particularly enjoyed</u>
<u n="115" who="S0421">and like yeah no I read erm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0423" trans="overlap">but like I I mean that was done as I think that's kind of I think I would enjoy more er er reading philosophy in a</u>
<u n="117" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0423">er knowing that it is just</u>
<u n="119" who="S0421" trans="overlap">in in its purest form yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0423">yeah well they they're</u>
<u n="121" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0423" trans="overlap">telling you about their theories indirectly rather than in</u>
<u n="123" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="124" who="S0423" trans="overlap">written in</u>
<u n="125" who="S0421">it's quite good that</u>
<u n="126" who="S0423" trans="overlap">you you have to</u>
<u n="127" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah I've read like extracts and things from certain books</u>
<u n="128" who="S0423">yeah although you</u>
<u n="129" who="S0421" trans="overlap">and they're quite interesting</u>
<u n="130" who="S0423" trans="overlap">having said that it probably is like anything of that kind of <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> you know anything that's a bit academic it's probably very hard to get through it <unclear/></u>
<u n="131" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah cos a lot of them as well a lot of them are erm <vocal desc="laugh"/> like translated if it if they're from different countries and things and then there's like all these like debates over the translation and it's like no this wasn't accurately translated doesn't actually mean this at all and then other people are like no I think it means this so there's</u>
<u n="132" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0421" trans="overlap">all this debate and I'm just like because it there was a bit that I read and then like sometimes I see quotes and I'm like I need to see that in context so I see it in context and I'm like well I've not read the whole book I'll have a look what other people are saying and then there's these people on this like forum or whatever like debating like no well this person says this then this person says that</u>
<u n="134" who="S0423">mm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="135" who="S0421">yeah I think especially some of the some of the newer ones would be okay to read I think like you can get like philosophy for beginners or like you know</u>
<u n="136" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah something like that might be more <unclear/></u>
<u n="137" who="S0421" trans="overlap">or like quite erm they they like present it in quite like a</u>
<u n="138" who="S0423">simple</u>
<u n="139" who="S0421">a casual way you know what I mean? like you know</u>
<u n="140" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah cos I think to read any of your <trunc>or</trunc>original</u>
<u n="141" who="S0421" trans="overlap">or Aristotle or something</u>
<u n="142" who="S0423">yeah or even or modern ones or something</u>
<u n="143" who="S0421" trans="overlap">or Plato</u>
<u n="144" who="S0423">could be quite like <unclear/></u>
<u n="145" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah could be yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0423">erm be better to read a book that kind of explains it to you rather than reading it directly</u>
<u n="147" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0423">er what have you ever <trunc>rea</trunc> have you never read one a proper</u>
<u n="149" who="S0421" trans="overlap">I've never read like a yeah I'd quite like to I'd like</u>
<u n="150" who="S0423" trans="overlap">on philosophers or?</u>
<u n="151" who="S0421" trans="overlap">cos I've read like extracts and I've read all these were quite academic though the ones I was looking at either extracts and then I've read like a critic writing about it or like a discussion on like erm a forum but these forums tend to be like quite high like you know what I mean? they're not just kind of people like discussing</u>
<u n="152" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0421">like they are they do know what they're talking about like discussions erm and I I'm quite I I <trunc>fi</trunc> I found those quite interesting because even though the erm discussion itself was <pause dur="short"/> still quite academic it was easier for me to understand just reading it in its its like</u>
<u n="154" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0421">I feel like I'd need the book with kind of someone's like notes next to me like don't understand that that's actually a reference to like you know whatever and I'd be like oh okay</u>
<u n="156" who="S0423">mm <pause dur="short"/> so are you are you hungry yet or are you okay?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0421">I'm not that hungry <pause dur="short"/> are you hungry?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0423">no not at all really er cos this there's services here there's something about twenty odd miles I think</u>
<u n="159" who="S0421">oh we can go to those ones maybe</u>
<u n="160" who="S0423">erm cos after that well there probably is some further down this is the <pause dur="short"/> there must be some services if we're going past Bristol area</u>
<u n="161" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0423">erm <pause dur="short"/> so I mean if you're not hungry it's I don't know <pause dur="long"/> then again we don't wanna leave it too late do we cos?</u>
<u n="163" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0423">I'm just trying to think <trunc>ta</trunc> if you take that thing out of er the what what's the first line on it?</u>
<u n="165" who="S0421">Tiverton service area</u>
<u n="166" who="S0423">Tiverton</u>
<u n="167" who="S0421">junction twenty-seven</u>
<u n="168" who="S0423">and that's two hundred and thirty-one miles is it? is there a timing on that to the left?<unclear/></u>
<u n="169" who="S0421">ten eighteen</u>
<u n="170" who="S0423">oh I think it's just timing in each section</u>
<u n="171" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0423">so not an overall time there? er</u>
<u n="173" who="S0421" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="174" who="S0423">each section <unclear/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0421" trans="overlap">no I think you asked me this last time and there wasn't</u>
<u n="176" who="S0423">oh cos I've not printed out the whole thing so that's about two hundred miles that we've probably done</u>
<u n="177" who="S0421">that's like a bit further down the page there's Exeter so if you</u>
<u n="178" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well that's that's coming too <pause dur="short"/> too far down that cos what's the total mileage? so that's about the last two hundred miles of the journey isn't it?</u>
<u n="179" who="S0421">er Exeter is two hundred and forty-seven miles</u>
<u n="180" who="S0423">yeah see that</u>
<u n="181" who="S0421" trans="overlap">and Tiverton is two hundred and thirty-one</u>
<u n="182" who="S0423">yeah no we don't</u>
<u n="183" who="S0421">so Tiverton must be near Exeter</u>
<u n="184" who="S0423">yeah we don't wanna wait till that far down but it might be a bit soon yet I'm just trying to think cos I suppose we should have a little break some time but erm</u>
<u n="185" who="S0421" trans="overlap">we could always buy like sandwiches and then eat them later</u>
<u n="186" who="S0423">yeah well we've probably travelled <pause dur="short"/> probably a third of the way I would have thought <pause dur="short"/> so it's took us about two hours to get here and two four six that would be right wouldn't it? so let's shall we leave it another hour of driving?</u>
<u n="187" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0423">and then we've got probably half of the journey after that it's just sort of to break it up a bit it's probably a bit too early to stop</u>
<u n="189" who="S0421">yeah</u>
