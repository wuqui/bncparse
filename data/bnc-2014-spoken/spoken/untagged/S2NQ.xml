<u n="137" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0259">open</u>
<u n="139" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="140" who="S0259">when they were <unclear/> I'm like no one's ever gonna use that cos it's too open</u>
<u n="141" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0259">but the blue tits they used it</u>
<u n="143" who="S0255">oh yeah</u>

<u n="147" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0259">and what they do is actually camouflage</u>
<u n="149" who="S0255">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they do cos</u>
<u n="150" who="S0259" trans="overlap">I think that's weird that cos you'd think they'd prefer a camouflage it's protection innit?</u>
<u n="151" who="S0255" trans="overlap">you you can see in the hole they actually erm <pause dur="short"/> they start to chip away at the hole</u>
<u n="152" who="S0259">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0255">and they're not quite sure if they're trying to make it a bigger hole or whether they're just marking the territory or what they're doing but you can see and they do that while they're actually</u>
<u n="154" who="S0259" trans="overlap">mm you can see can't you? yeah <unclear>how they chip</unclear></u>
<u n="155" who="S0255">because we watched them the year they they went in there building the nest and they kept coming and going and <trunc>c</trunc> and basically the male and female come and they look and they inspect and he takes her round he finds loads of different ones and then takes her and shows her one or two and she chooses and if she doesn't like it they have to go off to a different one</u>
<u n="156" who="S0259" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0255">they call the starlings</u>
<u n="158" who="S0259">erm <pause dur="short"/> so then and he was making the hole bigger doing that and then they kept coming back and having <trunc>i</trunc> like second viewing and stuff like that</u>
<u n="159" who="S0259"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0255"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> but then in the end they did nest in there and yeah we we had a load of babies in there <pause dur="short"/> and we've had robins you <trunc>y</trunc> I don't think you can see but right at the end it's just a coconut er empty empty coconut shell with a really big</u>
<u n="161" who="S0259" trans="overlap">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0255">opening and we had robins in there about three years ago <pause dur="short"/> we had robins nesting in there</u>
<u n="163" who="S0259">oh brilliant</u>
<u n="164" who="S0255">and that was before we really put all the food out we now we're putting more food out <unclear>as I said</unclear> we had</u>
<u n="165" who="S0259" trans="overlap">you're getting all sorts now <unclear>lovely</unclear> yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah we had the blackbird last year <pause dur="short"/> erm and the blue tits were looking but I think because the <trunc>blackbi</trunc>bird had already claimed territory it was too close for comfort for the blue tits</u>
<u n="167" who="S0259">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0255">to go in there</u>
<u n="169" who="S0259" trans="overlap">those starlings they take everything don't they?</u>

<u n="171" who="S0259" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="172" who="S0255">and then they started coming and they came here and you're sort of like oh they've moved on to better quarters <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="173" who="S0259">yeah cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <unclear>said about this</unclear> the other day erm not last week I think it was the week before <pause dur="short"/> I was cleaning away and he was chatting away and I heard this almighty bang and</u>
<u n="174" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0259">I <pause dur="short"/> what was that? and he said</u>

<u n="324" who="S0255" trans="overlap">and she builds all the ant hotel and puts ant hotel on it and the hedgehog tunnel and</u>
<u n="325" who="S0259" trans="overlap">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="326" who="S0255">if you build it they will come <pause dur="short"/> I think that's just so <pause dur="short"/> it it is good cos it you think what can we do?</u>
<u n="327" who="S0259">yeah cos she has them rocks don't she?</u>
<u n="328" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="329" who="S0259">that she lifts <trunc>th</trunc>them on puts things underneath</u>
<u n="330" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="331" who="S0259">and puts it down</u>
<u n="332" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's it</u>
<u n="333" who="S0259">cos they get right under it don't they?</u>
<u n="334" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and it's really good getting kids to do it</u>
<u n="335" who="S0259">mm</u>
<u n="336" who="S0255">because</u>
<u n="337" who="S0259">cos nature's declining as well innit?</u>
<u n="338" who="S0255">yeah it is isn't it?</u>
<u n="339" who="S0259" trans="overlap"><unclear>especially</unclear> birds yeah <unclear>especially</unclear> birds</u>
<u n="340" who="S0255" trans="overlap">it is and I think you can if you can get kids in and this is why we thought with er you know the the bird food out there cos it's nice yes it's nice for us to watch but actually</u>
<u n="341" who="S0259" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's helping though isn't it?</u>
<u n="342" who="S0255" trans="overlap"><trunc>y</trunc> yeah you wanna you wanna keep the birds going <pause dur="short"/> that's another reason we the the plant we <trunc>d</trunc>decided cos <trunc>o</trunc>originally I dunnno <trunc>y</trunc> if you remember that was just a just a fence there was nothing out there</u>
<u n="343" who="S0259" trans="overlap">it was yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0255">so we got the acer tree which is down here and we had a different one erm that you could see through <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s bedroom window but that died we had that a few years with pink flowers <pause dur="short"/> but then we just kept looking at that fence and thinking what shall we do? and <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had ideas of lights and water all sorts and I was going let's start small you know cos he's always like oh we could do</u>
<u n="345" who="S0259" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="346" who="S0255">yeah so that's when we thought at least <trunc>le</trunc> get something and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had the idea of this hedge cos I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s got it at the bottom of his garden <pause dur="short"/> cos she said you get the flowers on it you get the berries on it</u>
<u n="347" who="S0259">that's right you do yeah</u>
<u n="348" who="S0255">and it it's grown really fast but it's never gonna go too big and we just keep keep it about that sort of</u>
<u n="349" who="S0259">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0255" trans="overlap">height and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> can chop it back a bit <pause dur="short"/> but yeah it's it's ideal and then say get more and more little bird boxes in there</u>
<u n="351" who="S0259" trans="overlap">that's just the job innit there?</u>
<u n="352" who="S0255" trans="overlap">think one of the ones <pause dur="short"/> there was one that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> made at at school and you can't really see it next to the the the the letter one that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got just to the right of it <pause dur="short"/> she made it at school and it's got a really tiny</u>
<u n="353" who="S0259" trans="overlap">oh I can see it yeah</u>
<u n="354" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah tiny little hole in it and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> actually made the hole bigger thinking something you know give more chance cos <trunc>p</trunc>people looking at it or people birds</u>
<u n="355" who="S0259">birds yeah</u>
<u n="356" who="S0255">but it's so tiny and I think maybe it'd do for a wren or something but we're not likely to get</u>
<u n="357" who="S0259" trans="overlap">yeah cos I like some of them likes many holes don't they?</u>
<u n="358" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah this is it but I think we're not necessarily gonna get a wren here</u>
<u n="359" who="S0259" trans="overlap">cos sometimes they build the nest so high up</u>
<u n="360" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="361" who="S0259">you've gotta watch that the little ones don't fall out</u>
<u n="362" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="363" who="S0259">cos they do</u>
<u n="364" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="365" who="S0259">if the holes are too big <pause dur="short"/> cos they do fill</u>
<u n="366" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="367" who="S0259">quite deeply in them don't they?</u>
<u n="368" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="369" who="S0259">sort of thick and then they get in the middle don't they?</u>

<u n="372" who="S0255">yeah</u>
