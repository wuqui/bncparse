<u n="3" who="S0075">and I can't really get on it <pause dur="short"/> but maybe it's better I don't go on it anyway <pause dur="short"/> because er there's certain things on there regarding um my son that I might not want to know or</u>
<u n="4" who="S0150">quite right</u>
<u n="5" who="S0068">yeah</u>

<u n="7" who="S0150">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0068">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="9" who="S0075">but it can be used for good or bad <pause dur="short"/> can't it</u>
<u n="10" who="S0068">I I think like anything in life it can be</u>
<u n="11" who="S0075">it can</u>
<u n="12" who="S0068">I I'm a bit of an addict</u>
<u n="13" who="S0075">er I know</u>
<u n="14" who="S0068">I very rarely go on the internet and I don't check Facebook <pause dur="short"/> and I I do have a Twitter account but I I I <trunc>d</trunc> I don't I haven't taken to Twitter so much <pause dur="short"/> whether it's cos it's restricted what you put er er it's more like text messages <pause dur="short"/> but I haven't really taken to that <pause dur="short"/> but I do use Facebook quite avidly</u>
<u n="15" who="S0075">yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0068">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0075">I think you have to be a lot more careful with what you're actually posting on there these days</u>
<u n="18" who="S0150">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0075">Don't they <pause dur="short"/> they're starting to be sort of libel cases against people</u>
<u n="20" who="S0068">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="21" who="S0075">and</u>
<u n="22" who="S0068">absolutely</u>
<u n="23" who="S0075">especially do you know to do with the you know racist <trunc>a</trunc> racist angles of things that people are saying <pause dur="short"/> they think that they they can't actually be you know they're hidden from what they're saying but very much not are they</u>
<u n="24" who="S0068">you have to be careful <pause dur="short"/> I mean people have lost their jobs over stuff they've put on Facebook</u>
<u n="25" who="S0075">they have</u>
<u n="26" who="S0068">you know whether or not that's wrong but you just don't put it on do you</u>
<u n="27" who="S0075">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="28" who="S0068">you can think it but you don't put it on in black and white</u>
<u n="29" who="S0075">no</u>
<u n="30" who="S0068">somebody can say well you said that about</u>
<u n="31" who="S0075">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0068">your manager <vocal desc="laugh"/> and</u>
<u n="33" who="S0150">yeah if you wouldn't stick it on your noticeboard</u>
<u n="34" who="S0068">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0150">in your office why would you stick it on Facebook?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0075">yeah that's the test really isn't it</u>
<u n="37" who="S0150">because you've got less chance of seeing it if it's stuck on a wall in your office</u>
<u n="38" who="S0068">probably yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's right</u>
<u n="39" who="S0075">that should be the test really</u>
<u n="40" who="S0150">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0075">you know if you wouldn't actually do that in person</u>
<u n="42" who="S0150">stick it on a wall by your desk <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0075">then why would you feel that you could do that</u>
<u n="44" who="S0150">stick it on Facebook</u>
<u n="45" who="S0075">um <pause dur="short"/> but I think sometimes certainly one person I know in particular the he can put it on there it's like a sounding board <pause dur="short"/> you're kind of getting something</u>
<u n="46" who="S0068">mhm</u>
<u n="47" who="S0075">out of your system or you're thinking you're getting something out of your system <pause dur="short"/> instead of maybe ranting and raving you know personally</u>
<u n="48" who="S0150">mm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0075">at somebody</u>
<u n="50" who="S0068">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0075">you're actually putting it down on there but thinking thinking in a way that it's personal but it's not <pause dur="short"/> it's very public</u>
<u n="52" who="S0068">and it's open to</u>
<u n="53" who="S0075">it's really public</u>
<u n="54" who="S0068">anybody who's on your friends list <pause dur="short"/> and if you haven't changed the privacy settings maybe <trunc>a</trunc> anyone can go along</u>
<u n="55" who="S0150">yeah</u>
<u n="56" who="S0068">some people's profiles are just open</u>
<u n="57" who="S0075">mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0068">you know you can click them even if you have absolutely no idea who they are</u>
<u n="59" who="S0075">mm</u>
<u n="60" who="S0068">you can click them</u>
<u n="61" who="S0150">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0075">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0068">and look up things about them <pause dur="short"/> that's not the case with most profiles <pause dur="short"/> but some people don't put any settings on it <pause dur="short"/> and you can just click through</u>
<u n="64" who="S0075">do do you think it's um sort of people are made aware of it enough to know? You know what's going on in terms of security settings and things like that or not?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0068">I</u>
<u n="66" who="S0075">is it people choose not to know some of that sometimes?</u>
<u n="67" who="S0068">I think there are some people who are ignorant of it</u>
<u n="68" who="S0075">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="69" who="S0068">and just don't know that you can go into privacy settings</u>
<u n="70" who="S0150">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0068">and change things</u>
<u n="72" who="S0075">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0068">see who you can view <pause dur="short"/> whether it's just your friends <pause dur="short"/> whether it's everyone</u>
<u n="74" who="S0075">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0068">um perhaps who can view different parts of your profile <pause dur="short"/> um I tend to set all mine just to friends</u>
<u n="76" who="S0150">mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0068">and nobody else <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> But er but</u>

<u n="81" who="S0068">I I think it's moderately it's clear to an extent but I can sort of see why some people wouldn't</u>
<u n="82" who="S0075">mm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0068">if they</u>
<u n="84" who="S0150">mm</u>

<u n="392" who="S0068">yeah <pause dur="short"/> this is it</u>
<u n="393" who="S0075">Cos they've just put it on Facebook</u>

<u n="397" who="S0150" trans="overlap">or if they <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="398" who="S0075">Cos they're tweeting instead of cleaning their teeth</u>
<u n="399" who="S0150">yeah</u>
<u n="400" who="S0075"><unclear/> about it <pause dur="short"/> yeah maybe</u>

<u n="403" who="S0150">you've gotta worry</u>
<u n="404" who="S0068">that's right</u>
<u n="405" who="S0075">because er go back to Twitter for a minute <pause dur="short"/> am I right in thinking Twitter is a restricted number of words?</u>
<u n="406" who="S0068">A hundred and forty characters <pause dur="short"/> which</u>
<u n="407" who="S0075">right</u>

<u n="410" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<event desc="unintelligible"/>
<u n="411" who="S0068">but it's like it's more like slightly less than a text message</u>
<u n="412" who="S0150">mm</u>
<u n="413" who="S0068">and maybe that's one reason why I've got the account but I haven't really taken to it <pause dur="short"/> I don't find it as easy to follow</u>
<u n="414" who="S0075">right</u>
<u n="415" who="S0068">you put all these little hash tags</u>
<u n="416" who="S0150">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="417" who="S0068">all link with people <pause dur="short"/> and I just I don't I maybe I've not made the effort but I just don't find it that easy to follow</u>
<u n="418" who="S0075">Cos there was a talk a while ago it might become more popular than Facebook and maybe it's already heading that way <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="419" who="S0068">it was Stephen Fry who popularized it</u>
<u n="420" who="S0150">yeah</u>
<u n="421" who="S0075">yeah</u>
<u n="422" who="S0068">he said I use Twitter and everyone suddenly joined Twitter</u>

<u n="428" who="S0075">yeah</u>
<u n="429" who="S0068">so er</u>
<u n="430" who="S0075">yeah</u>
<u n="431" who="S0150">actually if he'd just cleaned his teeth maybe it is a bit interesting</u>
<u n="432" who="S0068"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="433" who="S0075">I don't really wanna know when celebrities clean their teeth either to be honest <pause dur="short"/> I could still sleep not knowing that</u>

<u n="437" who="S0075">but <vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="438" who="S0068">but one <vocal desc="laugh"/> one thing I will say though about Facebook is I think there is a lot you hear a lot of negatives about it <pause dur="short"/> I do think there's a lot of positives as well</u>
<u n="439" who="S0075">yeah there are <pause dur="short"/> and we've just focused on the negatives really haven't we from</u>
<u n="440" who="S0068">because um I I mean I've got quite a lot of people on my friends list now <pause dur="short"/> some people say oh a lot of these are virtual friends you've never met them</u>
<u n="441" who="S0075">mm</u>

<u n="444" who="S0068">but I do</u>
<u n="445" who="S0150">yeah</u>
<u n="446" who="S0068">find people who have similar interests</u>

<u n="449" who="S0075">yes</u>

<u n="452" who="S0068">a really big fan of Roger Federer</u>
<u n="453" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="461" who="S0075">oh yeah yeah well er I think that's a very good thing</u>
<u n="462" who="S0068">it's quite interesting to the game similar to it than um</u>
<u n="463" who="S0075">A and the other very good thing about it of course um is is the fact that you can find people on there that you really wanna get in touch with</u>

<u n="465" who="S0075">either family members or friends</u>

<u n="470" who="S0150">no</u>
<u n="471" who="S0068">no you'd struggle</u>
<u n="472" who="S0075">it</u>
<u n="473" who="S0068">you'd probably send them a card</u>
<u n="474" who="S0075">it would be very difficult</u>
<u n="475" who="S0068">it'd take several weeks to get there</u>
<u n="476" who="S0075">yeah</u>
