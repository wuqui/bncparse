<u n="2" who="S0522">oh</u>
<u n="3" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/> which was quite amusing <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="4" who="S0522" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="5" who="S0520" trans="overlap">it's like mum going to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I want to you to be in charge of <vocal desc="misc"/> and then you just think mm maybe this wasn't the easiest way round</u>
<u n="6" who="S0519">no</u>
<u n="7" who="S0520">he's been good in the end</u>
<u n="8" who="S0519">he was in the end but you're right it's you know we hire Anyvan dot com</u>
<u n="9" who="S0520">and they'll have the <trunc>sa</trunc> exact opposite reaction like dad'll be like well this one's only a thousand pounds but the other people want four and mum'll be like no</u>
<u n="10" who="S0519">they <trunc>ca</trunc> if it's</u>
<u n="11" who="S0520" trans="overlap">go with the expensive one <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="12" who="S0519">well l I <trunc>ju</trunc> yeah as you very well know I say well what's wrong with it then? <vocal desc="laugh"/> but he had one he he said oh look these are from <trunc>o</trunc> thirty-nine pounds upwards <vocal desc="laugh"/> they're moving our entire house and your grand piano <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="13" who="S0522">dad you <unclear>only</unclear> pay for what you get</u>
<u n="14" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0520">well eventually of course you know whatever brilliant deal is up there it's not really a brilliant deal it's just like pretending to be and then they say oh by the way you know there's tax and this and that and it all adds up to the same doesn't it? it's not like anyone I mean six thousand pounds was a bit over the top but</u>
<u n="16" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah that's right <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0520">yeah so he's got a special guy to do the piano and the rest he doesn't care about really</u>
<u n="18" who="S0519">well eventually we got a good people and I made him do the</u>
<u n="19" who="S0520" trans="overlap">stick it in a warehouse <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0519">so this is the very last thing I said have you checked any reviews? <vocal desc="laugh"/> er so we did and the firm got great reviews so we just went with that but it's three and a half thousand just for the furniture and erm another four hundred for the piano</u>
<u n="21" who="S0520">it's quite a lot isn't it? to be honest but that's including storage for six months</u>
<u n="22" who="S0519">yes I think he put five to six months and they estimated for that so</u>
<u n="23" who="S0520">so that takes you to September October November December <trunc>Nov</trunc></u>
<u n="24" who="S0519" trans="overlap">October November December January February March we won't be done by then I shouldn't think</u>
<u n="25" who="S0520" trans="overlap">well you might be</u>
<u n="26" who="S0519">we could be but</u>
<u n="27" who="S0520">when do people start putting their houses on?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0519">I think probably March</u>
<u n="29" who="S0520" trans="overlap">March probably yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0520">is that what you think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="32" who="S0519" trans="overlap">do you know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0522">sorry I didn't hear</u>
<u n="34" who="S0520">do when people start putting their houses on the market like March or April?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0522" trans="overlap">yeah usually it's spring isn't it?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0520" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0519">because we think it it's gonna</u>
<u n="39" who="S0520" trans="overlap">I mean you could find somewhere in the winter</u>
<u n="40" who="S0519" trans="overlap">we could we could</u>
<u n="41" who="S0520">but and you might get a better deal but erm most people wait don't they? to move in the summer</u>
<u n="42" who="S0519" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0522">so erm what's the next plan then?</u>
<u n="44" who="S0519">so</u>
<u n="45" who="S0522">so you've gotta do you have to store all your stuff somewhere?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0519">we do</u>
<u n="47" who="S0522">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0519">yeah so erm the firm are from Edinburgh and they'll store it somewhere doesn't matter to us and deliver it to the new place</u>
<u n="49" who="S0522">mm</u>
<u n="50" who="S0519">which we've told them is <anon type="place"/> erm as an approximate we said you know well dad said he's he's the one did did it all and erm so they've given a price for everything</u>
<u n="51" who="S0522">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0519">and the piano firm are from <anon type="place"/> and they're going to store it in <anon type="place"/> erm and it'll be delivered here erm to wherever and we signed up with an estate agent in <anon type="place"/> that had an <anon type="place"/> does that mean anything to you?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0522">yeah I've seen their name</u>
<u n="54" who="S0519">erm and they they've got an a an agent in <anon type="place"/> as well and so they've signed us up in</u>
<u n="55" who="S0522">you realise in the nice places that erm like there's someone at work who er is renting in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0519">and where's that?</u>
<u n="57" who="S0522">er near erm <anon type="place"/> so that kind of where the Lord Binning is where we've been to that pub</u>
<u n="58" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="59" who="S0522">erm and there was a big <trunc>p</trunc> there's a big park outside anyway erm but he's been looking to buy for two years and like the houses don't even get onto the website you know that they go because <vocal desc="cough"/> an agent tells them it's coming and they go and see it before it's even so I <trunc>th</trunc> you know in these nice places I think that's why you need to probably register with more you know agents as opposed to relying on Rightmove</u>
<u n="60" who="S0519" trans="overlap">mm mm mm mm Rightmove they only get to Rightmove</u>
<u n="61" who="S0522">because people want to live in these</u>
<u n="62" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0522">spots and they're just so popular</u>
<u n="64" who="S0520" trans="overlap">that's a good point you probably I mean Rightmove is a nice place to sort of feed your dreams and see what you want you know</u>
<u n="65" who="S0522">that's it yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0520" trans="overlap">but it's not the place probably to spot your house cos like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> says it's been on for a while</u>
<u n="67" who="S0522" trans="overlap">and if it's been on for two years there's a reason <unclear/> it's just</u>
<u n="68" who="S0519">no that's right</u>
<u n="69" who="S0520">someone doesn't want to live there cos it's like mouldy or something on a road or something</u>
<u n="70" who="S0519">yeah no we just saw a nice one on the A51 you know we said you know that that's why it's still on there cos it <trunc>lo</trunc> you think</u>
<u n="71" who="S0522">but also how expensive</u>
<u n="72" who="S0519">they're crazy prices</u>
<u n="73" who="S0522">the houses are in <anon type="place"/> like we just up the <trunc>r</trunc> here if you go out here and then you carry on straight up that hill</u>
<u n="74" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0522">there's two for sale on the right and they are detached but they're very close to the other ones and the gardens are quite modest I think one's a three-bed and one's a four-bed and I was thinking well I I just I like that road and I like the house and er I looked and it was like nearly five hundred thousand</u>
<u n="76" who="S0520">shit</u>
<u n="77" who="S0522">you just think what?</u>
<u n="78" who="S0520">you're very close to Manchester and Warrington here I wonder if you went a hour south of here you wouldn't have</u>
<u n="79" who="S0522" trans="overlap">oh yeah you've got the luxury of being out</u>
<u n="80" who="S0520">because it's not a commuter distance any more</u>
<u n="81" who="S0519">no er erm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0520">I mean people do commute that far but it's not really needed is it?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah no I think that's what we're hoping to do</u>
<u n="84" who="S0520" trans="overlap">you just and you don't want to be too near to Birmingham the other side</u>
<u n="85" who="S0519">is be a little bit more south but then when you when you see like <anon type="place"/> seems a lovely village or a like a almost a mini town isn't it?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0522">yeah a very nice one yeah</u>
<u n="87" who="S0519">erm but very nice and then erm so we've seen some houses near there just on Rightmove and they always looks lovely but really expensive</u>
<u n="88" who="S0522">oh yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0519">erm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0522">cos that's like family heaven there you know? there's good schools and commuting</u>
<u n="91" who="S0519">that's right</u>
<u n="92" who="S0522">same with <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="96" who="S0522">it's less isn't it? but yeah I don't know it</u>
<u n="97" who="S0519" trans="overlap">cos that was nicer to us that it was further south</u>
<u n="98" who="S0522">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0519">and a little bit smaller and erm a little bit rolling hills woah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0522">mm yeah it's <unclear/> a bit isn't it?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0520">this is mum I mean mum was saying that she didn't she you know you're more inclined to be south of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> than north of her <unclear/> you didn't like it up there much</u>
<u n="102" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yes I I I love the beautiful area near <anon type="place"/> but all I could think was you know that everything south of you is just an industrial wasteland</u>
<u n="103" who="S0520" trans="overlap">Blackburn and all of the places</u>
