<u n="635" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="636" who="S0008">or I could get a new hard drive for it</u>
<u n="637" who="S0012">you could yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="641" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="642" who="S0008" trans="overlap">a refurbished cheap computer</u>
<u n="643" who="S0013">yeah</u>

<u n="646" who="S0008">and then you're like in the end otherwise hardly I I don't want the problem about the hard drive sort of suddenly gives up the ghost and then I've got to recover all <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s stuff off it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="647" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="648" who="S0013">no</u>

<u n="651" who="S0008">I mean for a five you know half a terabyte you know</u>
<u n="652" who="S0012" trans="overlap">half a <trunc>tera</trunc> yeah I know</u>
<u n="653" who="S0008">cos like you know you sort of think</u>
<u n="654" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="655" who="S0008" trans="overlap">you could but the the terabyte ones are are cheaper than the half terabyte ones</u>
<u n="656" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah why is that?</u>
<u n="657" who="S0008">well because</u>
<u n="658" who="S0013" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="660" who="S0008" trans="overlap">modern</u>
<u n="661" who="S0012">you know</u>
<u n="662" who="S0008">cos er you know er in when I bought it <pause dur="short"/> they were the terabytes were quite a little bit more expensive you know a couple of quid</u>
<u n="663" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="664" who="S0008">so I thought well I don't need I'll just go for the</u>
