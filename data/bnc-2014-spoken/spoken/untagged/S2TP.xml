<u n="253" who="S0321" trans="overlap">it's about half an hour to walk</u>
<u n="254" who="S0320">yeah that's about that's a good distance then</u>
<u n="255" who="S0321" trans="overlap">yeah erm</u>
<u n="256" who="S0320">so it'll be it'll be summer</u>

<u n="263" who="S0321">erm she has suggested some things but this</u>
<u n="264" who="S0320" trans="overlap">cos <trunc>ju</trunc> is there anything about erm plants so like all of the soft fruits is there anything about ones that can go next to each other and work together and that might fight with each other?</u>
<u n="265" who="S0321">erm <pause dur="short"/> berries are all fine</u>
<u n="266" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="267" who="S0321" trans="overlap">mixed I mean you want to rotate so this is my first year plan</u>
<u n="268" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="269" who="S0321">and then I'll probably move everything on one bed for the following year</u>
<u n="270" who="S0320">every year?</u>
<u n="271" who="S0321">well these are all annuals</u>
<u n="272" who="S0320">but you need to move them every year?</u>
<u n="273" who="S0321">you should do</u>
<u n="274" who="S0320">my dad doesn't I think he does rotate them but I'm pretty sure it's not every year</u>
<u n="275" who="S0321">but the other thing you can do if you don't do it then you just need to replace like put lots of manure</u>
<u n="276" who="S0320">that's what he does</u>
<u n="277" who="S0321">or do</u>
<u n="278" who="S0320">he does it every year he gets</u>
<u n="279" who="S0321" trans="overlap">green manure</u>
<u n="280" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0321">which is clover so I tried to plant clover in the rose beds this year</u>
<u n="282" who="S0320">oh</u>
<u n="283" who="S0321" trans="overlap">but it I didn't get there in time and it didn't germinate but I got all these leaves in this one</u>
<u n="284" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="285" who="S0321">erm and I sent <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> the photo cos I was like these things</u>
<u n="286" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="287" who="S0321" trans="overlap">look like clover or <trunc>wh</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> what is it and er and I I tried one cos it looked like rocket but it wasn't rocket <vocal desc="laugh"/> turns out it was poppies</u>
<u n="288" who="S0320">poppies?</u>
<u n="289" who="S0321">yeah cos I had it</u>
<u n="290" who="S0320" trans="overlap">oh</u>

<u n="298" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="299" who="S0321" trans="overlap">and I think that they must have fallen in with the clover</u>
<u n="300" who="S0320">ah</u>
<u n="301" who="S0321" trans="overlap">and they germinated and the clover didn't</u>
<u n="302" who="S0320">oh how funny so you've got a bed full of poppies</u>
<u n="303" who="S0321">I know which is not really where I want it cos it's in my salad bed <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="304" who="S0320">you you want it</u>
<u n="305" who="S0321" trans="overlap">I might have to have a half salad bed</u>
<u n="306" who="S0320"><vocal desc="laugh"/> ah</u>
<u n="307" who="S0321">er the then at least if I get the poppy seeds then I can move them and then</u>
<u n="308" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="309" who="S0321">yeah</u>
<u n="310" who="S0320"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="311" who="S0321">for next year so yeah I mean they'll be really beautiful so if that's what they are</u>
<u n="312" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="313" who="S0321">but there's there's load there's like an area like that that's just</u>
<u n="314" who="S0320" trans="overlap">they're massive as well aren't they?</u>
<u n="315" who="S0321" trans="overlap">thick</u>
<u n="316" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0321">I mean at the moment they're just like they look like sort of little dandelion leaves</u>
<u n="318" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="319" who="S0321">but they're slightly hairy I probably shouldn't have eaten one</u>
<u n="320" who="S0320">no probably not eh</u>
<u n="321" who="S0321">yeah and trees</u>
<u n="322" who="S0320">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="323" who="S0321">so I'm gonna put one here and one here</u>
<u n="324" who="S0320" trans="overlap">are these oh they're not there already?</u>
<u n="325" who="S0321">no there was a bit erm horse chestnut tree here</u>
<u n="326" who="S0320">oh wow</u>
<u n="327" who="S0321" trans="overlap">erm like bit like the the erm the trunk was like half a metre diameter</u>
<u n="328" who="S0320" trans="overlap">oh my god</u>
<u n="329" who="S0321">erm I quite wanted to keep it but the council said that it was above it was too big for the plot so I'm not allowed</u>
<u n="330" who="S0320" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="331" who="S0321">trees more than twelve foot high</u>
<u n="332" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="333" who="S0321">erm <pause dur="short"/> and also they pointed out that it's it'll be sapping all the</u>
<u n="334" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0321">goodness from the land</u>
<u n="336" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah definitely if it's that big</u>
<u n="337" who="S0321" trans="overlap">there was one here and one here so</u>
<u n="338" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0321">this <trunc>wa</trunc> they were both cut down</u>
<u n="340" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="341" who="S0321">but it means that they've left quite nice stumps for sitting on as well <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="342" who="S0320">oh cool</u>
<u n="343" who="S0321">erm <pause dur="short"/> so yeah they're sort of around here</u>
<u n="344" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="345" who="S0321">but and I haven't quite decided what trees</u>
<u n="346" who="S0320">apple trees?</u>
<u n="347" who="S0321" trans="overlap">I keep uming and ahing</u>
<u n="348" who="S0320" trans="overlap">pear trees?</u>
<u n="349" who="S0321">I think I think pear I don't eat enough pears</u>
<u n="350" who="S0320">apples?</u>
<u n="351" who="S0321" trans="overlap">to warrant a pear tree but I think apples could be good but maybe a mixed variety tree cos you can get them where</u>
<u n="352" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="353" who="S0321">they've got different varieties grafted on</u>
<u n="354" who="S0320">oh</u>
<u n="355" who="S0321">so you get it like <pause dur="short"/> like two or three different varieties because also you have to be careful about erm <pause dur="short"/> self-pollinating trees</u>
<u n="356" who="S0320">yeah I remember having a lecture from my dad it's all so very complicated</u>
<u n="357" who="S0321">yeah</u>
<u n="358" who="S0320">which tree you put next to each other so that they</u>
<u n="359" who="S0321" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> on the</u>
<u n="360" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="361" who="S0321">on the Royal Horticultural Society website</u>
<u n="362" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="363" who="S0321">there's like a <trunc>po</trunc> cross-pollinator finder because not all breeds</u>
<u n="364" who="S0320" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="365" who="S0321" trans="overlap">of apples will will cross-pollinated other</u>
<u n="366" who="S0320" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="367" who="S0321">so you need to get two you either need to get one that's self-fertile</u>
<u n="368" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="369" who="S0321">or get two or get</u>
<u n="370" who="S0320" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="371" who="S0321" trans="overlap">a tree that's got two that are complementary grafted on</u>
<u n="372" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="373" who="S0321">the same</u>
<u n="374" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="375" who="S0321" trans="overlap">you can actually get a mixed apple and pear tree as well</u>
<u n="376" who="S0320">that sounds a really</u>
<u n="377" who="S0321" trans="overlap">which I was thinking of</u>
<u n="378" who="S0320" trans="overlap">weird</u>
<u n="379" who="S0321">sound really weird I know I didn't like that <trunc>i</trunc></u>
<u n="380" who="S0320" trans="overlap">it sounds really odd</u>
<u n="381" who="S0321">yeah</u>
<u n="382" who="S0320"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="383" who="S0321">and then I was thinking should I go for something more interested for the other like a fig <pause dur="short"/> or a plum or a cherry but cherries grow very big if they're good</u>
<u n="384" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="385" who="S0321">so I'm not sure but</u>
<u n="386" who="S0320">yeah you want something that's not going to <pause dur="short"/> cause problems for all the rest of the vegetables I suppose</u>
<u n="387" who="S0321">no and you know it will <trunc>sh</trunc> it will shade part</u>
<u n="388" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="389" who="S0321">cos at the moment I've just got a full sun plot</u>
<u n="390" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="391" who="S0321">there's no area</u>
<u n="392" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="393" who="S0321">that's not sunny</u>
<u n="394" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="395" who="S0321">erm at all except for I guess right in front of the shed</u>
<u n="396" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="397" who="S0321">but where I got this plan from</u>
<u n="398" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="399" who="S0321" trans="overlap">what I was working on this book called The Half-Hour Allotment</u>
<u n="400" who="S0320"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="401" who="S0321">so the theory is that you <pause dur="short"/> if you set up your allotment right with</u>
<u n="402" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="403" who="S0321">the right plants you can get yourself food every week of the year</u>
<u n="404" who="S0320">oh wow</u>
<u n="405" who="S0321">and erm you only have to go is it it's half an hour <pause dur="short"/> like four times a week or something</u>
<u n="406" who="S0320">oh cool</u>
<u n="407" who="S0321">or you could condense that into longer slots at</u>
<u n="408" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="409" who="S0321">the weekend so it but there's a lot of set up</u>
<u n="410" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="411" who="S0321">and then the theory is all you need to do is pop up and weed</u>
<u n="412" who="S0320">brilliant</u>
<u n="413" who="S0321" trans="overlap">do a bit of watering but actually like the guy in the plot next to me says he doesn't water</u>
<u n="414" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="415" who="S0321" trans="overlap">what he did for his raised beds which he made all himself <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> he put cardboard down just straight onto the grass</u>
<u n="416" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="417" who="S0321">and then manure and compost on top of that</u>
<u n="418" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="419" who="S0321">and because the cardboard is so wet and</u>
<u n="420" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="421" who="S0321">retains the moisture he hasn't watered all summer</u>
<u n="422" who="S0320">wow</u>
<u n="423" who="S0321">and he's got some</u>
<u n="424" who="S0320">so there was</u>
<u n="425" who="S0321" trans="overlap">he's still got sunflowers in his bit <vocal desc="laugh"/> and it's</u>
<u n="426" who="S0320" trans="overlap">oh really?</u>
<u n="427" who="S0321" trans="overlap">November it's crazy yeah</u>
<u n="428" who="S0320">so he just put his beds on top of the grass then?</u>
<u n="429" who="S0321">yeah</u>
<u n="430" who="S0320">he didn't dig them over or anything?</u>
<u n="431" who="S0321">no he went up I mean and most people</u>
<u n="432" who="S0320" trans="overlap">I mean that's interesting</u>
<u n="433" who="S0321">because of all the bones</u>
<u n="434" who="S0320">yeah of course</u>
<u n="435" who="S0321">have not dug down they've gone they've gone up instead</u>
<u n="436" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah no fair enough <pause dur="short"/> wow</u>
<u n="437" who="S0321">but yeah <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="438" who="S0320" trans="overlap">that's really exciting</u>
<u n="439" who="S0321" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I don't think I'll get it all this year though</u>
<u n="440" who="S0320">erm</u>
<u n="441" who="S0321" trans="overlap">half of it</u>
<u n="442" who="S0320">yeah no maybe not</u>
<u n="443" who="S0321">no</u>
<u n="444" who="S0320" trans="overlap">it looks like a longer project</u>
