<u n="1" who="S0238">no these are the ones that I bought did I tell you? <trunc>fr</trunc> where the place where I stayed</u>
<u n="2" who="S0243">you said it was somewhere I couldn't remember where</u>
<u n="3" who="S0238" trans="overlap">down <anon type="place"/> erm that she made pottery</u>
<u n="4" who="S0243" trans="overlap">heavy <pause dur="short"/> very nice</u>
<u n="5" who="S0238">I'm not thrilled with the colour but it's a lovely shape to hold <pause dur="short"/> very satisfying and a decent size of handle that you can put your hands through</u>
<u n="6" who="S0243" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="7" who="S0238">erm so I bought four <pause dur="short"/> and what do you think of the coffee? because that's got almond milk in cos I</u>
<u n="8" who="S0243" trans="overlap">it's strong for me</u>
<u n="9" who="S0238">oh do you want some <trunc>m</trunc> more hot water some more milk or</u>
<u n="10" who="S0243">no leave it I'll I'll drink it but it er it is too strong really</u>
<u n="11" who="S0238"><vocal desc="laugh"/> that is a silly thing well if it's too strong I can add a bit there's still a bit of space in the mug mind you that would make it heavier</u>
<u n="12" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh you</u>
<u n="13" who="S0238">I really meant what do you think of flavour? <pause dur="short"/> can you taste that it's not milk milk?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0243">I don't think so</u>
<u n="15" who="S0238">I think that I've tried both almond milk and soya milk erm the soya milk is slightly higher fat it mean it's still it's comparable to semi-skimmed and the almond milk is actually slightly less erm <pause dur="short"/> so I think it does taste a little bit richer but there's not a lot in it erm</u>
<u n="16" who="S0243">I wouldn't have known it was anything different</u>
<u n="17" who="S0238">no I mean there's a range of when you go there's a different ones some of them have got flavourings in and god knows what erm and some of them are sweetened well to me that turns them into <trunc>some</trunc> <trunc>tha</trunc> then not then a milk substitute there's</u>
<u n="18" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm I agree</u>
<u n="19" who="S0238" trans="overlap">they're something different erm so I just went for <pause dur="short"/> the original you know</u>
<u n="20" who="S0243" trans="overlap">although there is sugar in milk it's lacrose isn't it? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0238">yes but</u>
<u n="22" who="S0243">I remember at school being told there was sugar in er there was sweetness in milk</u>
<u n="23" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="24" who="S0243">and thinking mm sort of thing and they gave us a glass of water and a glass of milk and if you compared the water with the milk yes it was sweet</u>
<u n="25" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="26" who="S0243">you could tell</u>
<u n="27" who="S0238">well isn't it isn't that what the problem is that you're that you can be lactose intolerant?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0243">I suppose</u>
<u n="29" who="S0238">erm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0243">did I didn't say lactose what did I say?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you said lacrose and I think that's</u>
<u n="32" who="S0243">I was gonna say that was wrong</u>
<u n="33" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah and and I listened to it and thought</u>
<u n="34" who="S0243">no</u>
<u n="35" who="S0238">no it <trunc>is</trunc> it is <unclear/></u>
<u n="36" who="S0243" trans="overlap">you should've said</u>
<u n="37" who="S0238">yeah well <pause dur="short"/> erm but</u>
<u n="38" who="S0243">yeah I like this beaker to hold</u>
<u n="39" who="S0238">yes <pause dur="short"/> erm cos you get the <pause dur="short"/> the chunkiness of of a a bowl if you like a breakfast cup</u>
<u n="40" who="S0243" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="41" who="S0238" trans="overlap">without it being so wide and difficult to to hold</u>
<u n="42" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0243">well erm when <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> left her mum and she came down to my house and brought me a beaker and it was these colours and it was that lovely curved shape it didn't have a sort of stand on the bottom</u>
<u n="45" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0243">and eventually it got broken and I tried all over to get one like it cos I'd really liked it</u>
<u n="47" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="48" who="S0243">the hold of it and everything but I never found one</u>
<u n="49" who="S0238">well if you see together the four that I bought you would you'd know that they were hand thrown these two are pretty similar in shape and everything but the <trunc>oth</trunc> the other two are very <trunc>sl</trunc> they were all slightly different height and and</u>
<u n="50" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0238"><trunc>sli</trunc> you know erm and I hadn't really realised that <trunc>th</trunc> that's inevitable with hand-thrown pots isn't it?</u>
<u n="52" who="S0243">I suppose it is</u>
<u n="53" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> she'd got a range and I I got <trunc>f</trunc> the four that seemed most similar but it was kind of two pairs rather than a four if you see what I mean</u>
<u n="54" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="long"/> well I didn't think I'd be sitting here in this sunshine</u>
<u n="55" who="S0238" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="56" who="S0243" trans="overlap">this morning</u>
<u n="57" who="S0238">well I'm <trunc>rel</trunc> relieved it's given me that's those are the sheets that were on the bed when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was here which is over a week ago</u>
<u n="58" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="59" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and it's the first opportunity I've had to erm to wash them I did one lot of washing <pause dur="short"/> you know just of clothes and hung them out and basically they were as wet when I brought them in</u>
<u n="60" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0238">as they had been when I put them out it was just such a damp grey day</u>
<u n="62" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0238">erm I did it and had to dry them inside and of course at this time of year they don't dry inside very quickly</u>
<u n="64" who="S0243">we've had perhaps a couple of hours of slightly sunnier than all the gloom</u>
<u n="65" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0243" trans="overlap">each afternoon cos when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> came he was sweating <pause dur="short"/> you know with just doing things</u>
<u n="67" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well it hasn't necessarily been cold</u>
<u n="68" who="S0243">no</u>
<u n="69" who="S0238">but</u>
<u n="70" who="S0243">but I've had the fire on each year in</u>
<u n="71" who="S0238" trans="overlap">if oh yeah but if it's grey and damp that doesn't necessarily help does it?</u>
<u n="72" who="S0243">no</u>
<u n="73" who="S0238">there's one of those spider's <trunc>w</trunc> there's a spider's web there I don't know whether you can see it</u>
<u n="74" who="S0243">what am I look at? the glass?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0238" trans="overlap">just there through the glass a spider's web</u>
<u n="76" who="S0243">yes</u>
<u n="77" who="S0238">yes er</u>
<u n="78" who="S0243"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="79" who="S0238">there was one</u>
<u n="80" who="S0243">there's loads of spiders at the moment</u>
<u n="81" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes it must be that time of year there was one in the <trunc>she</trunc> the big shed when I walked in the other day right across the middle of the shed and I hadn't seen it and I walked straight into it</u>
<u n="82" who="S0243">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0238">and it actually ended up I had to come back and clean my glasses cos they ended up with the parallel lines of the of the cobweb right across one lens it was really weird but I was very happy that I didn't end up with the spider going down my neck cos it was a large one <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0243"><vocal desc="laugh"/> well as I go into the greenhouse each each day I do that as <trunc>wa</trunc> go through the doorway</u>
<u n="85" who="S0238"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0243">and if you go between the greenhouse and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s hedge you're doing this</u>
<u n="87" who="S0238">yes yes well I've I get very large ones in the house sometimes sort of and they stand out particularly on the dining room carpet of course erm but well I mean they don't bother me particularly but it it is annoying to walk into the the cobwebs they seem to do that round all my doors they do it at the front door as well</u>
<u n="88" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm I've had one or two pretty big ones in the bath which <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> tends to rescue with a glass and piece of card</u>
<u n="89" who="S0238"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="90" who="S0243">well I don't want just to wash em down the bath it isn't fair <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0238">well yeah but there are millions of spiders in <vocal desc="laugh"/> we <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0243">they're supposed to bring good luck aren't they spiders?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0238">well if you believe in things like that</u>
<u n="94" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0243">well I'd rather believe in it than not</u>
<u n="97" who="S0238"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="98" who="S0243">oh I've tried to get up that white buddleia</u>
<u n="99" who="S0238">right</u>
<u n="100" who="S0243">I trimmed it back to about a foot <pause dur="short"/> and I've dug and dug and dug and I've got it clear around the three sides but one root is going right back I think it might even go under the wall and into the hut</u>
<u n="101" who="S0238" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="102" who="S0243">so I'll get <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to finish off digging it up</u>
<u n="103" who="S0238">okay fair enough that means it's going to be difficult to plant though doesn't it?</u>
<u n="104" who="S0243">well I think you can root trim</u>
<u n="105" who="S0238">mm you could do that before you dug it up then couldn't you?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0243" trans="overlap">well I thought about that as well but I I'd wait and see what he does</u>
<u n="107" who="S0238">yes erm</u>
<u n="108" who="S0243" trans="overlap">he's</u>
<u n="109" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I'll hold off on what I was thinking seeing as it was white and I ended up you know I was supposed to have blue one pink and one white</u>
<u n="110" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh yes</u>
<u n="111" who="S0238">and I didn't I ended up with two purple and one white and I don't know whether the purple ones were meant to be blue or pink because well blue or red <pause dur="short"/> they didn't look quite like either of the of the ones</u>
<u n="112" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0238" trans="overlap">in the er catalogue anyway I ended up with the two purples ones together erm <pause dur="short"/> I want to grow up a bit more a barrier because where that tree was cut down</u>
<u n="114" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="115" who="S0238">there's now a space through to next door now you can't see it when you're sitting here because of that bush but if you're further down you can or even</u>
<u n="116" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0238">when I'm up on the decking I can I can if he's pottering around in the <trunc>gar</trunc> in the greenhouse I can see him</u>
<u n="118" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="119" who="S0238">I mean it's not exactly hugely intrusive but the idea was to grow the buddleias erm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0238">in that space erm and I thought I'd put the white one between the two purple ones well at the moment they're still in pots and I won't plant them out until I've got yours</u>
<u n="122" who="S0243">well <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> spent his couple of hours last week getting the raspberries cleaned up and clear er I'd spent a good three quarter of an hour for about three days running getting rid of all the stuff they were not taken care of at all last year I always used to weed them and everything and I just didn't do anything and I don't think I had more than six raspberries anyway</u>
<u n="123" who="S0238"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="124" who="S0243">but you can't blame em but what they've got and it's happened over the last about three years but this year was worse is bindweed and it's around all the raspberries or it might be that way I don't know <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/> tell you erm and as he was saying if you leave as much as that in the ground it wills sprout so I might be stuck with bindweed forever more but if I can do something about it in the spring so it doesn't get a a big hold</u>
<u n="125" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="126" who="S0243" trans="overlap">as it's done</u>
<u n="127" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0243">we'll see but he's he's spent a lot of time there <pause dur="short"/> and I've got now well he finished getting the last apples off er cos he was faffing around by the tree <pause dur="short"/> so those are all on the bedroom floor <pause dur="short"/> and I have had I do go in about every two or three days and pick out anything that looks as though it's going bad and chuck it</u>
<u n="129" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0243">but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> has had two lots I took <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> some and fortunately <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had been blackberrying so they had blackberry and apple pie they were very</u>

<u n="136" who="S0243" trans="overlap">I was gonna say last year it was embarrassing</u>

<u n="138" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh you've had some of course</u>
<u n="139" who="S0238">mm yeah well I will have some more erm <pause dur="short"/> you could have brought them actually I I've I've got a drawer in the kitchen that doesn't normally have anything in</u>

<u n="142" who="S0243" trans="overlap">right yeah <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> says she wraps each one in newspaper</u>
<u n="143" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well we I remember doing that at at</u>

<u n="149" who="S0238" trans="overlap">when I was a kid I can I remember doing that</u>
<u n="150" who="S0243" trans="overlap">we were certainly did it at our house when we'd apples there</u>
<u n="151" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I er I used to do that with my apple tree actually when I think about it it depends how many you've got I suppose</u>
<u n="152" who="S0243" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0238" trans="overlap">as to whether it's worth it <pause dur="short"/> erm and you can of course do stewed apple and freeze it</u>
<u n="154" who="S0243">yes I've done that I've got a big bag full of that <pause dur="short"/> and I made three apple pies in erm those little foil things <pause dur="short"/> cos one of those is big enough for two</u>
<u n="155" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0243">in fact a bit too big</u>
<u n="157" who="S0238">well again you can freeze apple pies can't you?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0243">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's where they are</u>
<u n="159" who="S0238"><unclear>but er</unclear></u>
<u n="160" who="S0243">in fact I did one apple and blackcurrant which just</u>
<u n="161" who="S0238">wow</u>
<u n="162" who="S0243" trans="overlap">makes it a big different</u>
<u n="163" who="S0238">there's two butterflies having a right dance just there I don't know <trunc>whe</trunc> it's well surely the wrong time of year for them to be mating but they were er <pause dur="short"/> one of them's there but there were there was a pair sort of flying together you know</u>
<u n="164" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> well perhaps they're befuddled by the weather</u>
<u n="165" who="S0238"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm glad there's a bit of a breeze as well as the sun because <pause dur="short"/> well firstly that'll help my washing dry but also I want to cut my lawn <pause dur="short"/> it's needed doing for a while and when it's wet it's it's not particularly nice and also I've had other things that also needed doing in the garden shall I show you my latest project? er I can't take you down the garden</u>

<u n="170" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="172" who="S0243" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="173" who="S0238" trans="overlap">the garden does actually seem to curve slightly to the left so you really can't see it from here <pause dur="long"/> but obviously that's been <trunc>tak</trunc> oh taking me time <pause dur="short"/> and every I've it's taken me three goes probably five to five and a half hours altogether spread out over three goes cos it does my back in and every <trunc>sing</trunc> each of those three times I've carefully checked the weather forecast and seen it wasn't supposed to rain today or <trunc>n</trunc> first thing the next day and every single flipping time it's rained earlier than it had been forecast to do I mean the last time it actually I mixed the cement and it started drizzling</u>
<u n="174" who="S0243">mm</u>

<u n="219" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you know erm and burglar alarm was never seemed to be affected at all I would just have thought that a modern burglar alarm was designed so that it it could ride out things like that because it does happen</u>

<u n="221" who="S0238" trans="overlap">no but mine at the other house wasn't</u>

<u n="259" who="S0238">erm but I don't know about <pause dur="short"/> you see I would I would have assumed that with tits and things that it was the <trunc>sa</trunc> it was the same birds but I'm not sure that it is necessarily because I've been told that robins yes he was there that robins for example if you've got a robin in your garden in winter and in summer it's not necessarily the same robin <pause dur="short"/> they that even they migrate</u>
<u n="260" who="S0243">they're coming</u>
<u n="261" who="S0238">yes these are the grey tits hello darlings <pause dur="long"/> all looking very handsome that is a <pause dur="short"/> I mean I know there were adults coming before but also there were a lot of youngsters and I think that could be the youngsters that now have are in full adult plumage</u>
<u n="262" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="263" who="S0238">because that all three that landed then looked to be adults to me and I don't think there were three <trunc>ad</trunc></u>

<u n="265" who="S0238">it's not the size it's the it I mean they the they were they were the same sort of size it's just the markings</u>
<u n="266" who="S0243">when I was down with the raspberries obviously I I took that little erm seat that I sit on to weed and so on and I was quite happy down there by myself bit of birdsong around and suddenly there was a a movement and it was a robin and it came and it came round the other side of me and it came down there and it looked at me and I <trunc>don</trunc> I think he must have thought I was gonna dig a wormhole for him</u>
<u n="267" who="S0238"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="268" who="S0243">erm but it didn't go away particularly mind you I didn't make any big movements and it's done it about three or four different days</u>

<u n="270" who="S0243">so</u>
<u n="271" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you see the robin that comes here <pause dur="short"/> is I thought robins were like that were quite confiding is the word that birdwatchers seem to use</u>
<u n="272" who="S0243">oh</u>
<u n="273" who="S0238">but the robin that comes here isn't like that it's very shy <pause dur="short"/> the tits are much less nervy than the robin <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="274" who="S0243">mm <pause dur="short"/> well I haven't seen him I mean occasionally I've seen a robin in the garden but this was sort of persistent</u>
<u n="275" who="S0238">mm yeah <pause dur="short"/> but the jay hasn't been for quite a while so</u>

<u n="279" who="S0238">the things like that do seem to go in in phases <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>

<u n="282" who="S0243">and we always have done</u>
<u n="283" who="S0238">and I <pause dur="short"/> well I wasn't hearing it last year so much as it came to the feeder quite a lot and this year that's why I've had those peanuts out even though the squirrel comes but no not a sign <pause dur="short"/> which is a shame</u>
<u n="284" who="S0243">I'm feeling something yes</u>

<u n="292" who="S0243">oh</u>
<u n="293" who="S0238" trans="overlap">which I thought was odd because <pause dur="short"/> she wasn't that old I mean <pause dur="short"/> she wasn't young but to me <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is</u>

<u n="297" who="S0238" trans="overlap">right yeah <pause dur="long"/> no going back to jobs that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> sort of set up erm you know the compost bin was one thing erm but the other another thing that I've been working on I've I've painted the</u>

<u n="300" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="301" who="S0238" trans="overlap">it's doesn't <pause dur="short"/> it looks a lot better because it's white but it ended up with a lot of <pause dur="short"/> quite deep grooves in it and I sanded it and what it really needed was planing well I haven't really got a plane so I didn't</u>
<u n="302" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="303" who="S0238">so it still looks quite sort of scratched but most of it you don't really see it because of the blind and the fact that it's now white instead of a nasty tacky brown varnish stuff not</u>
<u n="304" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="305" who="S0238" trans="overlap">not brown varnish veneer erm</u>
<u n="306" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh mm</u>
<u n="307" who="S0238">does look definitely better so I'm I'm leaving it like that for now</u>
<u n="308" who="S0243">so have you much more to do with your house?</u>
<u n="309" who="S0238">well there's the upstairs room to do which I I'm planning to do probably at Christmas <pause dur="short"/> erm and yes I meant to talk to you about <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the bottom terrace of the orchard <pause dur="short"/> needs to be soil so that I can plant vegetables and things and I was an idiot to plant that grass there at all so</u>
<u n="310" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="311" who="S0238" trans="overlap">in other words the work that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> did has kind of been wasted because I planted grass and now I want to dig it all up again</u>
<u n="312" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="313" who="S0238">I don't think that I'm going to be able to do that myself and the one of the reasons being that I can't get the big powerful strimmer to start when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was here after a lot of effort he managed to get it going and I did some strimming but you do one lot and then you need to do another you know I need I need to get it right down to as close to the ground as possible and I didn't do that and I tried to start it again and I just I can't do it <pause dur="short"/> it for a start it really needs two people it jumps about like fury when you <trunc>tr</trunc> when you pull the you know it's one of these</u>
<u n="314" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="315" who="S0238" trans="overlap">it's a it's a petrol-driven thing and you need to pull a string to spark it erm and even if you've got one foot on it it's a lot easier if someone's also holding it</u>
<u n="316" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="317" who="S0238" trans="overlap">but also you need to do it a few times with <pause dur="short"/> the throttle open and that's this it you basically need three arms</u>
<u n="318" who="S0243"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh right</u>
<u n="319" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and a very long body <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know or very long arms or something it's just a stupid design erm the other one I can start because it's not so stupidly designed but that one <pause dur="short"/> erm and I actually I couldn't pull the string out of the it's full length it was sticking for me</u>
<u n="320" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="321" who="S0238">which meant obviously it wasn't gonna spark erm <pause dur="short"/> so I was <trunc>won</trunc> I mean it's I don't know how many hours work it would be to clear it it's hard to tell <pause dur="short"/> erm but I was wondering about asking <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to do it because I really think that it's beyond me <pause dur="short"/> even if I could get the <trunc>strim</trunc> what I wanted to do was try and get the strimmer working strim it down to stubble and start digging it up with the fork and see <pause dur="short"/> er how much it was doing my back in and how much I could do at a time and whether I thought I could manage it but if I can't do the strimming then I can't do the the</u>
<u n="322" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="323" who="S0238" trans="overlap">the four kilo <unclear/> though</u>

<u n="325" who="S0238">because</u>
<u n="326" who="S0243">so er how much would you want him?</u>
<u n="327" who="S0238">well I need him to come and look at it and tell me <pause dur="short"/> what he thought really</u>
<u n="328" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="329" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> it's hard for me to judge because it would take me weeks and weeks because I would I knowing how long it took me to do that front garden digging it all up</u>
<u n="330" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="331" who="S0238">I could only do half an hour at a time and then my back was seizing up</u>
<u n="332" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="333" who="S0238">erm and I can't get a lot done in half an hour he could probably do more than me in half an hour anyway</u>
<u n="334" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="335" who="S0238">but I don't know <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="336" who="S0243">well he's going away at the end of this month <pause dur="short"/> I think only to Scotland or Wales or something like that</u>
<u n="337" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I mean it's not urgent but it needs doing this autumn</u>
<u n="338" who="S0243" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="339" who="S0238" trans="overlap">so that I can</u>
<u n="340" who="S0243" trans="overlap">I'll certainly ask him but I don't know how much time</u>
<u n="341" who="S0238">no</u>
<u n="342" who="S0243">he's prepared to spend on things cos I don't know who else he goes to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> of course</u>
<u n="343" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well it's not going to be an ongoing it's a sort of one-off job getting it cleared that I've planted it with this meadow grass and I shouldn't have done I should have left it clear <pause dur="short"/> so it needs getting back to soil again</u>
<u n="344" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="345" who="S0238">and then I would have to keep it weed free</u>
<u n="346" who="S0243">yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0238">well there's no point in doing it too soon because the grass is still growing a bit</u>
<u n="348" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="349" who="S0238">but so it <trunc>i</trunc> it's an autumn job erm <pause dur="short"/> I've got another gooseberry bush on order</u>
<u n="350" who="S0243">right</u>
<u n="351" who="S0238">to replace that one that died so it needs doing before that would come <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but anything that's</u>

<u n="356" who="S0243" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="357" who="S0238">I found that <trunc>tha</trunc> two or three times I've at garden centres I've looked and thought oh yes that looks like a good bush and then backed off when I realised how much</u>
<u n="358" who="S0243">yes</u>
<u n="359" who="S0238">things like that are</u>
<u n="360" who="S0243">well I wasn't expecting to pay that I think I'd thought probably thirteen or fourteen pounds but I've thought about a rhododendron down there for a long time</u>
<u n="361" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="362" who="S0243" trans="overlap">so I thought right I'll have one</u>

<u n="365" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well the amount of trouble once they're in you just leave them</u>
<u n="366" who="S0243">well yes and it's exactly I mean deliberately where I can see it from the kitchen</u>
<u n="367" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="368" who="S0243">which is is what I wanted because there's a fuchsia there that hasn't really grown much at all and when I think about fuchsias there isn't a right lot of colour for the size of the bush</u>
<u n="369" who="S0238">I think that depends on the fuchsia well I went walking in <anon type="place"/> on Thursday and one of the gardens that I went past had well a range of things along er they had a sort of flowerbed by the by the edge of the garden as it were and it had several different small fuchsias which were in full bloom</u>

<u n="373" who="S0238" trans="overlap">actual foliage now it may be that when they get bigger that happens less I think the one that I had at the other house was pretty good value but this one here</u>
<u n="374" who="S0243" trans="overlap">yeah that was when you came up the steps weren't it?</u>
<u n="375" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes but this one here is as you're saying it's a lot of <trunc>gr</trunc> of foliage and not very much blossom</u>
<u n="376" who="S0243">yeah</u>
<u n="377" who="S0238">erm I'm just kind of waiting for the blossom to die down a bit more and then I'm going to cut it down completely and put something else there because it it also just grows so much in a season that I'm constantly having to cut it back to able to use the path which is silly</u>
<u n="378" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm oh I've had the notice about the brown bins</u>
<u n="379" who="S0238">oh right so you are getting them</u>
<u n="380" who="S0243">so I've an October collection of green bags</u>
<u n="381" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="382" who="S0243">and then that's it till something like April fourth when it will be bin it <trunc>y</trunc> you know you have to ring up to order it?</u>
<u n="383" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="384" who="S0243">which I thought was a bit odd and then I thought well there must be a lot of people who've had green bags who've never ever used em</u>
<u n="385" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="386" who="S0243">so same with brown bins I suppose</u>
<u n="387" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I don't think that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I can't remember what the son's called have got a brown bin when I've been putting mine out there hasn't been one going out there</u>
<u n="388" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="389" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and and they certainly put other things out</u>
<u n="390" who="S0243">but you rang up to order it?</u>
<u n="391" who="S0238">oh yeah</u>
<u n="392" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="393" who="S0238">so but I mean obviously they've got quite a big garden so I don't know why they've made that choice</u>
<u n="394" who="S0243">mm <pause dur="short"/> I can't say I'm thrilled about this brown bin I just cannot see it holding as much as I need it to hold when the two hedges are cut</u>
<u n="395" who="S0238">yes well I mean it said</u>
<u n="396" who="S0243" trans="overlap">er</u>
<u n="397" who="S0238">something like it holds the equivalent of three to five</u>
<u n="398" who="S0243">yes</u>
<u n="399" who="S0238">green bags well for a start there's a big difference between three and five and secondly no way does it hold five green bags worth that's just ridiculous</u>
<u n="400" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="401" who="S0238">erm and anything that's a bit of an awkward shape <pause dur="short"/> quite often would go into those green bags because they're quite wide</u>
<u n="402" who="S0243">yes</u>
<u n="403" who="S0238">whereas it won't into the bin so you're having to spend more time cutting things down to fit I'm still using the green bags as well</u>
<u n="404" who="S0243">well I'm keeping them at the moment to see how it all goes</u>
<u n="405" who="S0238">yes well I've exactly I mean I had five or six er and I'm keeping those</u>
<u n="406" who="S0243">I think I have five now</u>
<u n="407" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and</u>
<u n="408" who="S0243">I think I once had seven</u>
<u n="409" who="S0238">I'm having to <pause dur="short"/> go to the tip as well although to be fair I missed the September brown bag brown bin collection because that was when I was away</u>
<u n="410" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="411" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> but yeah <pause dur="short"/> no it it's it <vocal desc="misc"/> what annoys me when they send out the information with things out is they they try to present it as if it's better for you <pause dur="short"/> if they were just honest</u>
<u n="412" who="S0243" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="413" who="S0238">and said we're sorry darlings but it's a lot easier for our bin men</u>
<u n="414" who="S0243">yes</u>
<u n="415" who="S0238">then fair enough because it is <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm but you know they're pretending that it's in some way more convenient for us which is clearly isn't <pause dur="short"/> and if you read the rest of the thing</u>
<u n="416" who="S0243">it going cold?</u>
<u n="417" who="S0238">it's a bit cooler now the sun's gone hasn't it?</u>
<u n="418" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="419" who="S0238">erm you know if you read the rest of the thing which</u>
<u n="420" who="S0243" trans="overlap">it's blowing more</u>
<u n="421" who="S0238">which is clearly sort of addressing possible complaints and and queries and so on</u>
<u n="422" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="423" who="S0238">it's obvious that a lot of people's immediate reaction is oh no that's not very good for me</u>
<u n="424" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm well it just depends how much garden you've got really</u>
<u n="425" who="S0238">yes <pause dur="short"/> erm well I suppose they must have had some idea of how many <pause dur="short"/> green bags</u>
<u n="426" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="427" who="S0238" trans="overlap">people averaged if you see what I mean</u>
<u n="428" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> and they're very generously letting us keep our green bags</u>
<u n="429" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="430" who="S0243">mind you I've had two fairly new ones I I mean a year older more than that with their handles sort of in the middle of the sides rather than on top and they've been very difficult to carry</u>
<u n="431" who="S0238">oh oh no I haven't got any like that but erm I mean a couple of mine are bit sort of torn and battered</u>
<u n="432" who="S0243" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="433" who="S0238" trans="overlap">but they're still worth keeping it depends what you put in them anyway doesn't it?</u>
<u n="434" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="435" who="S0238" trans="overlap">if the if it's mostly branches that's fine if it's small things they might fall through the hole but er</u>
<u n="436" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm well I've cut my own buddleia back as well because that's er finished I don't think there's anything else that wants cutting back those bushes where the leaves come red when they're new</u>
<u n="437" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="438" who="S0243">erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said I'll cut that back a bit but he's a bit one for shaping it all beautifully</u>
<u n="439" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="440" who="S0243">and I like a natural shape</u>
<u n="441" who="S0238">yeah well I I'm going to have to buy a hedge trimmer because</u>
<u n="442" who="S0243">I've got one you could have it because he uses his own it he he doesn't use mine</u>
<u n="443" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yours is <trunc>elec</trunc> has got a cable though</u>
<u n="444" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="445" who="S0238">I mean <pause dur="short"/> actually I might take you up on that and and borrow it if you like this season</u>
<u n="446" who="S0243" trans="overlap">well you can try it yeah</u>
<u n="447" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I mean I've got an <trunc>exten</trunc> well I've got your extension cable but I have actually got erm <pause dur="short"/> not one on a I've got yours that's on a drum and I've got another one that that isn't</u>
<u n="448" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh you've got that have you?</u>
<u n="449" who="S0238">er yes</u>
<u n="450" who="S0243">not that I've been looking for it I'd forgotten about it</u>
<u n="451" who="S0238">well again I thought that you said that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> brought his own stuff</u>
<u n="452" who="S0243" trans="overlap">he does</u>
<u n="453" who="S0238">and therefore you</u>
<u n="454" who="S0243" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="455" who="S0238">didn't really need it erm and obviously I need that for mowing the lawn and and things and and erm I like that better than the one that I inherited which is a lighter sort of thing erm so I could see how that went <trunc>bec</trunc> I just think that with a garden this size it's more convenient to have a petrol-driven thing but as on the other hand as <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said I'm finding it so difficult to start petrol-driven things that maybe that's not the best the hedge <trunc>tri</trunc></u>
<u n="456" who="S0243" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="457" who="S0238">I inherited a hedge trimmer and it had been left with petrol in it over winter which you're not supposed to do and that had perished something inside and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> tried to get it fixed and it was some little he replaced the spark plugs and then there was some little sort of tube thing and he bought some and <trunc>fi</trunc> and fiddled about and he's spent so long on it erm that I said apart from anything else if I'm paying him and hourly rate er it's cheaper to buy a new hedge trimmer</u>
<u n="458" who="S0243"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="459" who="S0238">and he and he was just determined to sort it but he never did of course and it and it's still up there unfinished and so unsorted and I suspect it never will even</u>
<u n="460" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="461" who="S0238">even if I took it in to be repaired I just think it's probably beyond repair erm and you pay so much for a professional to do that sort of thing I might as well buy a new one but I've got I mean that thing there needs trimming erm that green thing in by the pond</u>
<u n="462" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="463" who="S0238">erm but now in the front garden there's another green thing like that that grows over where you walk up the path</u>
<u n="464" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="465" who="S0238">that I haven't done anything to for quite a while that is getting a bit straggly and needs sorting erm the hebes need a bit of trimming and as I say I want to cut that fuchsia down if I start doing all that with my hand clippers it really makes my hands shake I find</u>
<u n="466" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="467" who="S0238">erm and there's quite possibly things down the garden as well I'm not very sure <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> I think <pause dur="short"/> at some point I will come over and borrow that</u>
<u n="468" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="469" who="S0238">and see how it goes but it may just be too awkward to use a <trunc>p</trunc> er an electric one in this garden</u>
<u n="470" who="S0243">it could be yes</u>
<u n="471" who="S0238">I mean I did borrow it for that holly hedge at the other house</u>
<u n="472" who="S0243">oh did you?</u>
<u n="473" who="S0238">mm erm</u>
<u n="474" who="S0243">well you may as well give it a try</u>
<u n="475" who="S0238">mm so I certainly know I can I mean it's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was saying she was hoping <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would come back er in time to to erm cut down their hedge you know they've got this well allotment you would call it if it was in England in German it is called a garden but in Germany it's much more than allotment you know it's got a hut in it that's swish enough to it's got running water and and you could sleep there</u>
<u n="476" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="477" who="S0238">for heaven's sake you know <vocal desc="laugh"/> when say hut I don't just mean a shed</u>
<u n="478" who="S0243" trans="overlap">and is it by the house?</u>
<u n="479" who="S0238">no no no I mean it's where there are others but there's</u>
<u n="480" who="S0243" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="481" who="S0238" trans="overlap">being Germany there's all sorts of rules and a certain percent of it percentage of it has to be given up to produce</u>
<u n="482" who="S0243">oh</u>
<u n="483" who="S0238">which I think is good and all sorts of things but they come round and inspect it from time to time and and she was saying they're going to get into trouble cos their hedge was too high and she couldn't use the hedge trimmer <vocal desc="laugh"/> so she was hoping <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would get back in time to do it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="484" who="S0243">is she the same sort of age as him?</u>
<u n="485" who="S0238">she's a few years younger erm I would say</u>
<u n="486" who="S0243" trans="overlap">I'd imagined her your age I mean</u>
<u n="487" who="S0238" trans="overlap">no she's</u>
<u n="488" who="S0243" trans="overlap">I must have seen her</u>
<u n="489" who="S0238">erm she's more than ten years older than me but not a lot more so I would say she's probably about sixty-three or four now</u>
<u n="490" who="S0243">mm well didn't you go for something like a special birthday?</u>
<u n="491" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that <trunc>wa</trunc> that was her fiftieth though that's quite a long time ago</u>
<u n="492" who="S0243" trans="overlap">fiftieth good heavens</u>
<u n="493" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah erm <pause dur="short"/> and that was the same year that I went to <unclear/> so it must have been two thousand <pause dur="short"/> when we think about it</u>
<u n="494" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="495" who="S0238" trans="overlap">so she must be sixty-four</u>
<u n="496" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="497" who="S0238">cos her birthday's at the end of August</u>
<u n="498" who="S0243">yep</u>
<u n="499" who="S0238">erm yes she had a bit do well she she did have a do for her sixtieth erm but where they were before of course they had a big they had a detached house with quite a big garden and they rented a marquee and put that up</u>
<u n="500" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="501" who="S0238">erm and invited all the</u>
<u n="502" who="S0243" trans="overlap">and did you go?</u>
<u n="503" who="S0238" trans="overlap">all the neighbourhood and everything no only for the fiftieth yes</u>
<u n="504" who="S0243">oh</u>
<u n="505" who="S0238">but for the sixtieth obviously they're they're now in a flat so they couldn't do that</u>
<u n="506" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="507" who="S0238">and I think they rented the village hall which is probably if it's attached to the church it'll be kind of next door cos the church is just over the wall stroke hedge from where they live because sometimes when I've been skyping <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the flipping bell's been ringing and he's had to shut the window cos we couldn't hear it other <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="508" who="S0243">mm <pause dur="short"/> I think the sun might be coming back it's down there</u>
<u n="509" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well yes I can <trunc>s</trunc> there's a you can see a bit there but there's quite a lot of cloud up there it's er it's not as nice a day as I thought it was going to be <pause dur="short"/> however</u>
<u n="510" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="511" who="S0238">as I say I <unclear/></u>
<u n="512" who="S0243" trans="overlap">do you iron those sheets?</u>
<u n="513" who="S0238">no</u>
<u n="514" who="S0243">well I don't I just wondered if er if you had to depends quite what they're made of</u>
<u n="515" who="S0238">they're just cotton but I need to buy a fitted cotton sheet I don't know why I haven't got one because I used to have flannelette sheets on in the winter and cotton ones on in the summer</u>
<u n="516" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="517" who="S0238">and then I stopped bothering with the cotton ones because actually even in the summer it's not particularly warm <vocal desc="laugh"/> in this country</u>
<u n="518" who="S0243">no</u>
<u n="519" who="S0238">erm and I just like the feel of flannelette <pause dur="short"/> but I would've had at least one fitted bottom sheet I mean I would have had two now I've a vague recollection of one tearing and I don't quite know how I I I never quite knew how it had torn whether it was in the washing machine and if so on what or or you know but</u>
<u n="520" who="S0243" trans="overlap">bit unusual that</u>
<u n="521" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah but as I say I would have had two because I'd have been alternating so I don't know but</u>
<u n="522" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="523" who="S0238">the last time <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> stayed here I realised I didn't have one erm and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s coming for a night in December</u>

<u n="526" who="S0243" trans="overlap">has she been here?</u>
<u n="527" who="S0238">no she's seen photos but she came <pause dur="short"/> well in the spring sometime I can't quite remember when and do you remember I went over to Manchester Airport and met her in a café at the airport</u>
<u n="528" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh yes</u>
<u n="529" who="S0238">at the airport sort of thing?</u>
<u n="530" who="S0243" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="531" who="S0238">because she was <trunc>goi</trunc> she's got a great aunt who lives <pause dur="short"/> well west of the airport rather than east of so she was going there for lunch which is why I met her for morning coffee er but this time she's going to visit the great aunt and then come over here for a night and then go down south to her sister erm because she's basically doing her Christmas visits at the beginning of December because they are house sitting for a friend in Italy for two months from something like the nineteenth of December to some time in February</u>
<u n="532" who="S0243">great</u>
<u n="533" who="S0238">very nice in Umbria erm cos they've actually invited me to go over <pause dur="short"/> in my Christmas holiday their friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who normally spends Christmas with them is going er and they said there's enough <trunc>s</trunc> space in this house for me to be there at the same time or after her cos</u>
<u n="534" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="535" who="S0238">the last time I went which is at least two Christmases ago if not three it <trunc>w</trunc> I went when <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> left if you see what I mean</u>
<u n="536" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="537" who="S0238">because they've only got one spare room with <unclear/></u>

<u n="539" who="S0238">no I've never met her because</u>
<u n="540" who="S0243" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="541" who="S0238"><vocal desc="laugh"/> we we've always sort of done this in and out thing you know</u>
<u n="542" who="S0243" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="543" who="S0238" trans="overlap">because well at their flat they they've basically got a spare bedroom I mean they've got they've each got a study in theory it's a four-bedroomed flat</u>
<u n="544" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="545" who="S0238">but that's what they were looking for because they'll each like to have a study so I suppose they could put up a camp bed in one of the studies</u>
<u n="546" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="547" who="S0238">erm but <pause dur="short"/> so no so I don't think I've ever met her erm</u>
<u n="548" who="S0243">so are you thinking you'll go?</u>
<u n="549" who="S0238">well <pause dur="short"/> my first thought was it would make sense to go she's going out pretty much the day after they arrive I think about something like the twentieth of December and staying till something like the second of January that's what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said and I was thinking if I went sometime between Christmas and New Year and stayed a bit longer than her I we could overlap and then you know then they're not <pause dur="short"/> then they haven't got the whole of the first fortnight that they're in their new place with visitors I think that's a bit much really</u>
<u n="550" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="551" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> but then I realised the second of January is when I'm going to see this consultant</u>
<u n="552" who="S0243">oh</u>
<u n="553" who="S0238">so that doesn't really fit and at the moment <pause dur="short"/> unless I can get my stomach under control it's not really very comfortable I wouldn't be very comfortable being in somebody else's house</u>
<u n="554" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="555" who="S0238">it's so bad</u>
<u n="556" who="S0243">I'm surprised that coffee doesn't upset your stomach</u>
<u n="557" who="S0238">well I don't I it does if I have more in an afternoon that's why I don't</u>
<u n="558" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> cos it's quite fierce</u>
<u n="559" who="S0243">yes <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but so I just don't know we'll <trunc>s</trunc> oh I sort of left it as well the other thing was <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> he said I could fly to Rome but Perugia is nearer <pause dur="short"/> only of course that's a small airport and there are flights from Stansted well I don't want the you know Ryanair of something I don't want to drive down to Stansted in order to fly to Perugia but otherwise he would drive to Rome to pick me up and it's a something like a hundred and fifty kilometres well I don't really want to land him with doing that now so in er I didn't say much but at the time I was thinking oh that's making me feel awkward</u>
<u n="560" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="561" who="S0238">and I looked and there really weren't any flights to Perugia from a from anywhere reasonable up here erm cos I was hoping that there would be from erm <unclear>Skittle</unclear> and then I could do I could go from Leeds Bradford you know</u>
<u n="562" who="S0243" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="563" who="S0238">in a double thingy but</u>
<u n="564" who="S0243">well the thing is you will be driving in the worst of our weather to get to an airport here</u>
<u n="565" who="S0238">yes so I don't know I want to go from anywhere but Leeds</u>
<u n="566" who="S0243">there were quite a lot of flights cancelled this last week because of fog in the south</u>
<u n="567" who="S0238">mm yeah <pause dur="short"/> but er</u>
<u n="568" who="S0243">mm lost my ring on the <unclear/></u>
<u n="569" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I mean when I went to Rome I think there was it there was a Jet two flight from direct from Leeds to Rome which would be the best option but I tried to check that and they weren't coming up so I don't really know about that so that's all a bit in the air</u>
<u n="570" who="S0243">mm</u>
<u n="571" who="S0238">what would be fantastic would be if this consultant did do a Friday afternoon and I could get in to see her sooner than that</u>
<u n="572" who="S0243">is there is that on the cards?</u>
