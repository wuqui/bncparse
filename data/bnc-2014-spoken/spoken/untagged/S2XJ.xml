<u n="628" who="S0666">mm</u>
<u n="629" who="S0492">a lot of the school the one I worked in London they used to try to get as many children as possible in for breakfast club even if they their parents didn't work because they wanted to know that they were starting the day with breakfast</u>

<u n="634" who="S0492">they used to say like you can come for free like just come because we want to know you're gonna start the day off with a full tummy and so it makes a difference to their attention for the rest of the day if they're not</u>

<u n="642" who="S0666">cereal they could just be having rubbish</u>

<u n="646" who="S0666">that was nice</u>
<u n="647" who="S0492">and then some of them used to stay after school even though their parents could look after them because they needed the help with the homework and they knew that if they went home no one was helping them at home they would just be sitting in front of the Playstation</u>
<u n="648" who="S0666">mm</u>
<u n="649" who="S0492">which isn't a bad thing but they would kind of go to our school club just to get a bit of extra help</u>
<u n="650" who="S0666">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so who was running that? the teachers or the</u>

<u n="653" who="S0492">TAs</u>
<u n="654" who="S0666">mm</u>

<u n="656" who="S0666">oh I see</u>
<u n="657" who="S0492" trans="overlap">so and a school is judged on its numbers of free school meals that's how they judge a school completely</u>
<u n="658" who="S0666">mm</u>
<u n="659" who="S0493">what do you mean completely?</u>
<u n="660" who="S0492">that's how a school gets its funding it's entirely based on its number of free school meals</u>
<u n="661" who="S0493">so not not grades not</u>
<u n="662" who="S0492">no in terms of when the government <trunc>l</trunc> just looks at a school and <trunc>s</trunc>so they'll say so for example that school in <anon type="place"/> or whatever</u>
<u n="663" who="S0493">mm</u>
<u n="664" who="S0492">they'll go right well this is the standard amount this school has to get because it's got sixty children so it has to have this amount but then they have a thing called pupil premium which then gives as school more money and that's based completely on the number of free school meals cos they think if for every child that needs free school meals then obviously they have to give a bit of extra money because there obviously there's gonna be some</u>

<u n="668" who="S0492">need to have</u>
<u n="669" who="S0492">so then that's why some of your richest schools are actually in the worst areas because they feel that they are the areas that need the extra money to look after the children that possibly aren't getting the at home support and things like that so that's why lots of schools try really hard <vocal desc="laugh"/> to get parents to know the free school <trunc>sys</trunc> the free school meal system</u>
<u n="670" who="S0666">oh</u>
<u n="671" who="S0492">they'll be a bit like are you sure you're not eligible? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
