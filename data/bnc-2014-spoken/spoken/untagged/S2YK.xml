<u n="492" who="S0671">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="493" who="S0674"><unclear/></u>
<u n="494" who="S0671">yeah take time out</u>
<u n="495" who="S0674">but yeah I think as well <unclear>er like</unclear> it sets you up well for well it does when you're at that age you need to learn these things like cos</u>
<u n="496" who="S0671">mm</u>
<u n="497" who="S0674"><unclear>else</unclear> it hits you hard later on</u>
<u n="498" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="499" who="S0674">so just to have a year where you say actually <unclear/> what's what is it you've gotta say to me? it's been pretty cool</u>
<u n="500" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="501" who="S0674">but at the same time it's been really really nice seeing the youth grow in different ways in the church</u>
<u n="502" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="503" who="S0674">so like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="504" who="S0671">yeah <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="505" who="S0674">the main one for me has been incredible this year</u>
<u n="506" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="507" who="S0674">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and that sort of age group but mainly <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s been the main influence I think on that group and <unclear/> has grown massively this year</u>
<u n="508" who="S0671">okay</u>
<u n="509" who="S0674">watching him pray for others at <anon type="place"/> or just <unclear>after</unclear> prayer on a Sunday</u>
<u n="510" who="S0671">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="511" who="S0674">mainly praying but in other ways as well with what he's come up with <unclear/> and stuff like that it's just been cool so good to see</u>
<u n="512" who="S0671">mm that's cool</u>
<u n="513" who="S0674">so yeah it's it's always encouraging when you know that stuff like that can happen</u>
<u n="514" who="S0671" trans="overlap">that's <unclear>cool</unclear> yeah</u>
<u n="515" who="S0674">if you allow it to happen and you give them opportunities</u>
<u n="516" who="S0671">so would he've done stuff like that before?</u>
<u n="517" who="S0674">he would've got there I'm sure but</u>
<u n="518" who="S0671">okay</u>
<u n="519" who="S0674">it's been nice to actually say <unclear/> do this</u>
<u n="520" who="S0671" trans="overlap">jump start yeah</u>
<u n="521" who="S0674">come on cos like yeah I've pushed him in ways that he probably wouldn't've thought I would've as well as pushed him in ways that he probably wouldn't want me to've pushed him at</u>
<u n="522" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="523" who="S0674">but now I'm sure he's fine with it</u>
<u n="524" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="525" who="S0674">cos like yeah just the way <unclear>it has</unclear> gotta be isn't it?</u>
<u n="526" who="S0671">he plays keys as well doesn't he?</u>
<u n="527" who="S0674">he does he's done that a few times</u>
<u n="528" who="S0671">mm that's cool</u>
<u n="529" who="S0674">at the front which has been cool</u>
<u n="530" who="S0671">that's cool</u>
<u n="531" who="S0674">yeah he's really coming along</u>
<u n="532" who="S0671">it's kind of interesting how you how you teach the things you were saying about like the finding the right way to live</u>
<u n="533" who="S0674">yeah</u>
<u n="534" who="S0671">how you teach that to people I think is a really interesting question dilemma isn't it?</u>
<u n="535" who="S0674" trans="overlap">okay yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="536" who="S0671">how would you <unclear>go about</unclear> would you do it the same way you've been taught like at <anon type="place"/>? or?</u>
<u n="537" who="S0674">erm</u>
<u n="538" who="S0671">do you think you need to teach people? or is it something they find on their own?</u>
<u n="539" who="S0674">so some things that <unclear/> quite often on Monday <unclear>or er</unclear> Sunday mornings</u>
<u n="540" who="S0671"><unclear/></u>
<u n="541" who="S0674">so sometimes I hear a talk on Monday and I think <trunc>w</trunc> if I have to say that to someone how would I say it? so you might have to tailor certain things</u>
<u n="542" who="S0671"><unclear/></u>
<u n="543" who="S0674">or you might wanna change it completely but most of the time I've just kept it fairly simple</u>
<u n="544" who="S0671">okay</u>
<u n="545" who="S0674">so just like what's the main points here?</u>
<u n="546" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="547" who="S0674">okay how are we gonna branch out from that?</u>
<u n="548" who="S0671">okay</u>
<u n="549" who="S0674">so one thing that I've especially done for <unclear/> is got them to actually do most of the work for themselves</u>
<u n="550" who="S0671"><unclear/></u>
<u n="551" who="S0674">so I <unclear>get up</unclear> a blackboard I'll put the topic in the middle and then I'll just say right branch out from this what what sort of things er can you get?</u>
<u n="552" who="S0671">that's cool</u>
<u n="553" who="S0674">but it's based around a Bible story or a Bible passage or something that</u>
<u n="554" who="S0671">yeah that's a good shout</u>
<u n="555" who="S0674">reflects from it so then they're learning the Bible they're reading out the Bible but they're not just doing that and thinking okay so that's what it meant back then they're <trunc>s</trunc> going right what does that mean now?</u>
<u n="556" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0674">so I'll show you some examples <unclear/> in a minute but yeah it's been cool watching them do that and then as well cos that's on the board afterwards I get them to pray</u>
<u n="558" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="559" who="S0674">so like erm I'll go round the circle saying guys we're gonna pray now it'll be good for us all to pray and if you can't think of anything then look at the board cos they've just put all the answers there themselves</u>
<u n="560" who="S0671"><unclear/></u>
<u n="561" who="S0674">so eventually that starts making them think again so that <trunc>w</trunc> that's been the main thing that's worked well for them for and for me</u>
<u n="562" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="563" who="S0674">cos like sometimes it's hard to know what to teach what to say</u>
<u n="564" who="S0671">mm</u>
<u n="565" who="S0674">if they're gonna enjoy it but at the same time sometimes if you do that all the time they're just gonna get ah it's we know what we've gotta do it's gonna be boring</u>
<u n="566" who="S0671">mm</u>
<u n="567" who="S0674">so the one thing that I need er <trunc>t</trunc>to start doing more of is putting like activities into it as well</u>
<u n="568" who="S0671">okay</u>
<u n="569" who="S0674">so like maybe it could be go outside and play a game and how that can link in or stuff I don't know but</u>
<u n="570" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="571" who="S0674">it'd just be a good idea to mix it up a bit</u>
<u n="572" who="S0671">mate that sounds incredible sounds like</u>
<u n="573" who="S0674">but it's been good</u>
<u n="574" who="S0671">sounds like erm you've nailed a lot in the last year <unclear/> <unclear>sounds</unclear> <unclear/></u>
<u n="575" who="S0674" trans="overlap">yeah it's been cool to just been given time to do stuff so like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s been on holiday so I've had to lead Friday night socials</u>
<u n="576" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="577" who="S0674"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s not been able to talk on a Sunday so I've had to have a little time to think about <trunc>wha</trunc> okay what can I do?</u>
<u n="578" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="579" who="S0674">and like just opening up and having them work in front of me and stuff like that like it's stuff that is fairly simple and anyone can do it but it's just <trunc>h</trunc></u>
<u n="580" who="S0671"><unclear>oh</unclear></u>
<u n="581" who="S0674">just thinking okay so <unclear>in fact</unclear> I've got to do it so what can I do sort of thing?</u>
<u n="582" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="583" who="S0674">but yeah it's been nice just to have opportunity cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s very flexible <unclear>anyway</unclear> he says do you wanna do this? do you wanna do that?</u>
<u n="584" who="S0671"><unclear>yeah</unclear></u>
<u n="585" who="S0674">sort of thing he won't say you've gotta do this for next week cos er obviously it's quite hard if you've gotta think of something in a week to say</u>
<u n="586" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="587" who="S0674">do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="588" who="S0671">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="589" who="S0674">but it's been nice to <trunc>h</trunc> just have that flexibility to say I trust you to do this if you want to you can</u>
<u n="590" who="S0671">yeah that's <unclear>cool</unclear></u>
<u n="591" who="S0674">cos obviously it opens it up a bit then doesn't it?</u>
<u n="592" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="593" who="S0674">yeah</u>
<u n="594" who="S0671">well it sounds like that's</u>
<u n="595" who="S0674">it's been nice</u>
<u n="596" who="S0671"><unclear/></u>
<u n="597" who="S0674">we have quite a lot of support around us as well like so far we've had so many more drummers turn up which has been great just <unclear>playing like</unclear> <unclear/> prayer</u>
<u n="598" who="S0671">yeah <unclear/> isn't it?</u>
<u n="599" who="S0674">so it just means that I don't have to do so much</u>
<u n="600" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="601" who="S0674">of the things that I have to do sort of thing cos no one else will do them</u>
<u n="602" who="S0671">okay yeah</u>
<u n="603" who="S0674">so it means that I've got more flexibility again to say oh I can do this now</u>
<u n="604" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="605" who="S0674">or do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="606" who="S0671">so like drumming and</u>

<u n="614" who="S0671">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="615" who="S0674">is there anything I can add? or even if it's just to <unclear>set up</unclear> <unclear/> <unclear>or pack down it's just</unclear></u>

<u n="712" who="S0674"><unclear/></u>
<u n="713" who="S0671">trying to tune into what everyone else is doing so develop your worshipping and develop your listening I would say</u>
<u n="714" who="S0674"><unclear>mm</unclear> yeah</u>

<u n="740" who="S0674">just from hearing other people drumming and then that <trunc>tau</trunc></u>

<u n="748" who="S0671">that would be genius</u>
<u n="749" who="S0674">that would be quite clever</u>
<u n="750" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/> did you have? you had lessons though did you? did you have any lessons?</u>
<u n="751" who="S0674">some I had I learnt how to play</u>

<u n="873" who="S0674">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="874" who="S0671">erm and their idea of the real world exists outside of their spheres so I I can understand where it where it comes from but and we do need to be connected with different I guess it's just saying that we need to be connected with different like ways of people different types of people isn't it?</u>
<u n="875" who="S0674">yeah</u>

<u n="885" who="S0674">and saying how it's so important that we need so many different people erm just in terms of instead of obviously saying we need we need a vicar we need a worship leader cos obviously that's fairly self-explanatory</u>
<u n="886" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="887" who="S0674">but saying how we need people who work in the church <unclear>just what and they're</unclear> people who work in the church for the church in terms of making it as good as it can be inside</u>
