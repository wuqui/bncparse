<u n="284" who="S0082">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> er came out of the bathroom yesterday and said the light won't go out <pause dur="short"/> so I said what do you mean the light won't go out?</u>
<u n="285" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="286" who="S0082">he said well I keep pulling the cord and the light won't go out</u>
<u n="287" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="288" who="S0082">so I said oh right so and he was absolutely right <pause dur="short"/> it wouldn't go out</u>
<u n="289" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="290" who="S0082">er <pause dur="short"/> would you like um would you like a biscuit?</u>
<u n="291" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> I'm alright actually thanks dad</u>
<u n="292" who="S0082">are you sure?</u>
<u n="293" who="S0084">I'll just have this banana <pause dur="short"/> thank you though</u>
<u n="294" who="S0082">um <pause dur="short"/> so er fortunately when I moved in here</u>
<u n="295" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="296" who="S0082">um before I bought the place I got er we had a <trunc>f</trunc> one of the people that worked on <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s um er loft extension</u>
<u n="297" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="298" who="S0082">er well not one but a number of people er were electricians because they had to <trunc>re</trunc> they had to wire it all</u>
<u n="299" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="300" who="S0082">and I was so impressed with them <pause dur="short"/> I met the person in charge <pause dur="short"/> I was so impressed that I kept his details <pause dur="short"/> so when I made an offer on the flat I gave him a ring <pause dur="short"/> and er he sent one of his guys down</u>
<u n="301" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="302" who="S0082">and he gave it a thorough check over</u>
<u n="303" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="304" who="S0082">and sent me a report <pause dur="short"/> and um there were a couple of small things that had to be done <pause dur="short"/> which they did <pause dur="short"/> but the main thing was to put a proper fuse box <pause dur="short"/> cos it had the original fuse box</u>
<u n="305" who="S0084">oh I remember</u>
<u n="306" who="S0082">in that cupboard</u>
<u n="307" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="308" who="S0082">and what they do now and we had the same issue in <anon type="place"/> Road <pause dur="short"/> exactly the same actually <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> and what they do now is instead of having fuses you have what they call contact breakers <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="309" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="310" who="S0082">if you get a surge</u>
<u n="311" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="312" who="S0082">which in er a fuse box have like a fuse</u>
<u n="313" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="314" who="S0082">um <pause dur="short"/> it that there's no fuse <pause dur="short"/> but er er the um tut er this unit flicks a switch which cuts all the power off immediately</u>
<u n="315" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="316" who="S0082">so it has two functions <pause dur="short"/> one it acts like a fuse <pause dur="short"/> so it's <trunc>pr</trunc> it protects your wiring from burning out if there's a huge surge</u>
<u n="317" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="318" who="S0082">and two it's um er a safety feature</u>
<u n="319" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="320" who="S0082">because you know children often put their fingers in plug points <pause dur="short"/> men er go out and mow the lawn with an electric mower and cut cut through the wire and stuff like that</u>
<u n="321" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="322" who="S0082">er and electrocute themselves <pause dur="short"/> women get terrible electric shocks sometimes electrocute themselves from washing machines and things</u>
<u n="323" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="324" who="S0082">er whereas when you've got this consumer unit the the <trunc>f</trunc> the first element of the short it's called a short circuit when that happens</u>
<u n="325" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="326" who="S0082">the first you know er in a nanosecond the first awareness flicks the switch</u>
<u n="327" who="S0084">tut <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="328" who="S0082">so you can't electrocute yourself</u>
<u n="329" who="S0084">nice</u>
<u n="330" who="S0082">um <pause dur="short"/> so what I did I um I flicked the switch</u>
<u n="331" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="332" who="S0082">which turned the light out <pause dur="short"/> and then I took the er um this <trunc>w</trunc> you know it's pull cord</u>
<u n="333" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="334" who="S0082">I took it apart and <vocal desc="laugh"/> I <trunc>ch</trunc> I fiddled around I I mean I the my first reaction was well this is <trunc>d</trunc> this is done for</u>
<u n="335" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="336" who="S0082">but of course I you know thought well I can just have a go <pause dur="short"/> so I fiddled around with it for about an hour</u>
<u n="337" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="338" who="S0082">and er I mean basically the spring er cos if you think about it you know when you pull it flicks back up <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> you pull it down it flicks back up</u>
<u n="339" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="340" who="S0082">there's obviously a spring in it to do that</u>
<u n="341" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0082">the spring was not only rusty but had broken</u>
<u n="343" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="344" who="S0082"><unclear/> it's probably forty years old</u>
<u n="345" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="346" who="S0082">the same age as the flat</u>
<u n="347" who="S0084">tut <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="348" who="S0082">so um so I um I tried to sort of cobble that together and I put it all back <pause dur="short"/> and then er inside there's a little wheel on a spindle <pause dur="short"/> and as you pull it it turns <pause dur="short"/> and that's what you know</u>
<u n="349" who="S0084">oh okay</u>
<u n="350" who="S0082">it's like like a little can <pause dur="short"/> it's it sort of flicks the switch</u>
<u n="351" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="352" who="S0082">as you do it <pause dur="short"/> and all <trunc>tha</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> and all that was falling to pieces as well <pause dur="short"/> the the plastic runners that it was seated in er had worn right down <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> and so it didn't make contact <pause dur="short"/> so it was ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> so anyway yesterday er I looked on the internet at nine o'clock cos I thought B and Q might not be open until er nine thirty or something <pause dur="short"/> thinking about how the shops open in the city centre</u>
<u n="353" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="354" who="S0082">I was quite surprised to find that B and Q is open from seven in the morning until</u>
<u n="355" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="356" who="S0082">nine at night <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="357" who="S0084">blimey</u>
<u n="358" who="S0082">so I cycled round to B and Q</u>
<u n="359" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="360" who="S0082">and er I bought the whole new unit <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> you know sort of <unclear/></u>
<u n="361" who="S0084">oh how annoying</u>
<u n="362" who="S0082">and then er it was only a fiver <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> and then I replaced it <pause dur="short"/> but you know having said that it took me a while to do all you know I had to cycle over there and then I had to come back and</u>
<u n="363" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="364" who="S0082">and do it all <pause dur="short"/> it took a while</u>
<u n="365" who="S0084">can you buy the um the pull cord separately? Or do you have to buy a whole new unit?</u>
<u n="366" who="S0082">er you can I mean you can  you can  buy er yeah I mean I if <trunc>y</trunc> somewhere like um</u>
<u n="367" who="S0084"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="368" who="S0082">er <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's probably not exactly the same but you can buy it separately</u>
<u n="369" who="S0084">no I was just thinking that in our house because they've got so many people coming and going</u>
<u n="370" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="371" who="S0084">I noticed the other day that the pull cord at the bottom is a completely different colour to er at the top</u>
<u n="372" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="373" who="S0084">Cos people have been disgusting not washing their hands or anything like that <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="374" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="375" who="S0084">it's really dirty at the bottom</u>
<u n="376" who="S0082">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="377" who="S0084">and obviously that's the landlord's responsibility but it'd be quite nice to sort of</u>
<u n="378" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="379" who="S0084">say to her look it's only a couple of quid from B and Q or something</u>
<u n="380" who="S0082">yeah</u>
<u n="381" who="S0084">can you just have it replaced cos that's disgusting?</u>
<u n="382" who="S0082">or or buy it buy the um what you need to do is to work out whether you can connect it</u>
<u n="383" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="384" who="S0082">in into the  into the  thing <pause dur="short"/> that's that's the <trunc>e</trunc> that's the other thing is if you buy</u>
<u n="385" who="S0084">I think it's one of those ones where where you unscrew it</u>
<u n="386" who="S0082">right</u>
<u n="387" who="S0084">at the top</u>
<u n="388" who="S0082">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but you've gotta disconnect the power first cos</u>
<u n="389" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="390" who="S0082">er all of that's live up there</u>
<u n="391" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> absolutely</u>
<u n="392" who="S0082">mm <pause dur="short"/> so you've gotta find a way to disconnect the power when nobody's using you know lights and stuff like that <pause dur="short"/> I mean I don't know what sort of fuse box you've got in your place but</u>
<u n="393" who="S0084">probably a hundred years old</u>
<u n="394" who="S0082">yeah</u>
<u n="395" who="S0084">I wouldn't</u>
<u n="396" who="S0082">I don't suppose she's replaced it <pause dur="short"/> so you you have to be very careful with things like that</u>
<u n="397" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's why I would never do it myself</u>
<u n="398" who="S0082">mm <pause dur="short"/> er but in theory you can</u>
<u n="399" who="S0084">I mean it's not like a pressing</u>
<u n="400" who="S0082">you can replace <pause dur="short"/> cos I'm sure because of this rather weird system of you know running this pulley across the top of the door and down the side</u>
<u n="401" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="402" who="S0082">I'm sure somebody must've um put that in er and the wooden um tut er <trunc>ha</trunc> er pull thing</u>
<u n="403" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="404" who="S0082">er has a hole inside that's far too big for the um cord</u>
<u n="405" who="S0084">tut <pause dur="short"/> oh right</u>
<u n="406" who="S0082">that's on the new pull switch</u>
<u n="407" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="408" who="S0082">so I've left the plastic one on <pause dur="short"/> what I've done I've because there are two plastic ones in there now</u>
<u n="409" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="410" who="S0082">one for the shower unit <pause dur="short"/> and one for the light</u>
<u n="411" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="412" who="S0082">I've um moved the handle you know the bit you pull</u>
<u n="413" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="414" who="S0082">up</u>
<u n="415" who="S0084">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> good</u>
<u n="416" who="S0082">the cord so that when you go in in the dark you can only grab</u>
<u n="417" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> you don't pull the <vocal desc="laugh"/> wrong one</u>
<u n="418" who="S0082">you can at shoulder height you can only grab <trunc>h</trunc> hold of one</u>
<u n="419" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="420" who="S0082">if you want  if you want  a shower you have to put your hand <unclear/></u>
<u n="421" who="S0084">oh that's a good idea</u>
<u n="422" who="S0082">um <pause dur="short"/> I haven't cut the cord er on it yet <pause dur="short"/> I've just you know kind of just in case I get</u>
<u n="423" who="S0084">just tied it or something</u>
<u n="424" who="S0082">in case I think of a better way of doing it I've just tied it up</u>
<u n="425" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="426" who="S0082">just to see how I how it works</u>
<u n="427" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="428" who="S0082">er <pause dur="short"/> but er if I <trunc>c</trunc> if I can't think of a better way and I can't find any flaws in in it I shall just cut the cord and it'll just instead of being a you know a metre and a half long or whatever it was before</u>
<u n="429" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="430" who="S0082">it'll just be you know a foot</u>
<u n="431" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="432" who="S0082">a foot long <pause dur="short"/> so you just reach up and pull it <pause dur="short"/> well I mean basically I don't think that's a problem cos there won't be any children doing it <pause dur="short"/> so er</u>
<u n="433" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="434" who="S0082">and er you can always replace as I said you can always replace the cord if you</u>
<u n="435" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="436" who="S0082">want to</u>
<u n="437" who="S0084">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> how come the um tut the light switch is in the place that it is? That you have to trail the lead</u>
<u n="438" who="S0082"><unclear/> stupid electrician I think</u>
<u n="439" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="440" who="S0082">or a <trunc>la</trunc> er either a stupid electrician a lazy electrician er or um a devious electrician <pause dur="short"/> because you know stupid because he didn't think about it</u>

<u n="444" who="S0082">lazy because he just didn't wanna run any more wire across <pause dur="short"/> it was <trunc>c</trunc> convenient for him to er just put a little bit of wire on <pause dur="short"/> or devious because he's saving the wire</u>
<u n="445" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="446" who="S0082">um</u>

<u n="453" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="454" who="S0082">um so um I don't know what it was <pause dur="short"/> but yeah it's just stupid <pause dur="short"/> it should be er mm they should've run the wire you know above the ceiling <pause dur="short"/> above the  above the  er Artex ceiling</u>
<u n="455" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="456" who="S0082">and to the the side of the door</u>

<u n="463" who="S0084">stupid</u>
<u n="464" who="S0082">but I've seen that often <pause dur="short"/> I mean er sometimes I've seen it because people have changed the way the door swings</u>
<u n="465" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="466" who="S0082">and of <trunc>cour</trunc> and and that happened a lot in <anon type="place"/> Road <pause dur="short"/> cos all the door well not all of them but lots of the doors had been rehinged</u>
<u n="467" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="468" who="S0082">because people you know wanted to use space in a different way</u>
<u n="469" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="470" who="S0082">of course there's you know that's just one of those things <pause dur="short"/> you know in a er actually what they should've done when they rehinged the door was get an <trunc>electr</trunc> er an electrician in to <trunc>c</trunc> come and <trunc>re</trunc></u>
<u n="471" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="472" who="S0082">rewire that light <pause dur="short"/> but of course you know that's an expense that a lot of people don't want</u>
<u n="473" who="S0084">absolutely</u>
<u n="474" who="S0082">but um sometimes in new houses er or even in er older places like this I've seen it you know where quite clearly er it's been like that from the word go</u>
<u n="475" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="476" who="S0082">you know <pause dur="short"/> er it's just down to the electricians <pause dur="short"/> and the same with the in the bathroom if you  if you  um in the bathroom and in the kitchen sink you have taps with levers on and not <unclear/></u>
<u n="477" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's it <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="479" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="480" who="S0082">okay? And when you turn them off you do that <pause dur="short"/> whereas the one in the bathroom when you turn them on you do that</u>

<u n="773" who="S0084">yep <pause dur="short"/> well they get a lot of letters <pause dur="short"/> but if you've just addressed it to David Cameron he will never see them</u>
<u n="774" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="775" who="S0084">and I was saying why don't you just you know start putting stuff in the internal post to number ten</u>
<u n="776" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="777" who="S0084">you know <pause dur="short"/> just</u>
<u n="778" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="779" who="S0084">even if it was just a proportion of the letters that he was getting through <pause dur="short"/> because he's not seeing anything</u>

<u n="781" who="S0084">he's not aware of the</u>
<u n="782" who="S0082">she's <trunc>probab</trunc></u>
<u n="783" who="S0084">level of</u>

<u n="787" who="S0084">she'd be fired</u>
<u n="788" who="S0082">mm</u>

<u n="794" who="S0082">I mean sometimes that's er that's good <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> because it it runs efficiently if everybody knows what they should and shouldn't do</u>
<u n="795" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="796" who="S0082">but of course the big danger is that um things get fudged</u>

<u n="798" who="S0082">and er and worse <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>

<u n="825" who="S0084">saying that</u>
<u n="826" who="S0082">I mean er not well <trunc>t</trunc> <trunc>ca</trunc> I dunno whether they call them criminals now <pause dur="short"/> it's it's people who would otherwise go to prison</u>
<u n="827" who="S0084">but they</u>

<u n="832" who="S0082">and er er and are kept in er sort of conditions which are similar to a prison but they would they're also treated for their condition</u>
<u n="833" who="S0084">right <pause dur="short"/> oh okay</u>
<u n="834" who="S0082">in a way <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure how much they're treated but um it maybe just they're given lots of drugs to keep them quiet <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="835" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="836" who="S0082">um</u>
<u n="837" who="S0084">lobotomy</u>
<u n="838" who="S0082">yeah</u>
<u n="839" who="S0084">so um I <trunc>d</trunc> don't think she's particularly enjoying the job <pause dur="short"/> and she's being quite cheeky <pause dur="short"/> I think she um</u>
<u n="840" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="841" who="S0084">she should get the train at eight thirty and be in by ten</u>
<u n="842" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="843" who="S0084">but sometimes she gets the nine o'clock train</u>

<u n="845" who="S0084">and gets the tube</u>
<u n="846" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="847" who="S0084">from Victoria</u>
<u n="848" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="849" who="S0084">so it's pretty lazy <pause dur="short"/> she rolls in at like ten past ten <pause dur="short"/> but I think once you're in it's one of those jobs that once you're in</u>
<u n="850" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="851" who="S0084">it's very difficult to um fire anybody</u>
<u n="852" who="S0082">mm <pause dur="short"/> often been interested in the civil service since I dealt with the rail industry <pause dur="short"/> when I  when I  you know when I worked before I um became involved in well er in fact it overlapped <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>bef</trunc> before I <trunc>c</trunc> got involved in directors and officers liability which was what I was doing at the end before I retired</u>
<u n="853" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="854" who="S0082">um for er you know <trunc>thr</trunc> four or five years um because Nick er my boss got involved initially</u>
<u n="855" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="856" who="S0082">er and he passed it all onto me when he got fed up with it <pause dur="short"/> um I er advised the Rail Regulator <pause dur="short"/> who is a civil servant</u>
<u n="857" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="858" who="S0082">er on er insurance matters</u>
<u n="859" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="860" who="S0082">and basically it was when they privatized the rail er could it used to be a nationalized</u>
<u n="861" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="862" who="S0082">industry</u>
<u n="863" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="864" who="S0082">but when they privatized it in the mid-nineties um every rail company had to have the same type of er what's called legal liability insurance</u>
<u n="865" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="866" who="S0082">as every other rail company whether it was the in those days it used to be Railtrack <pause dur="short"/> which was the biggest part <pause dur="short"/> now it's called Network Rail</u>
<u n="867" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="868" who="S0082">er they're the organization that manage all the lines the signals stations and things like that</u>
<u n="869" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="870" who="S0082">but all of the train operators you know like the ones in <anon type="place"/> First Capital Connect and <unclear/></u>
<u n="871" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="872" who="S0082"><unclear/> East Anglia or whatever it's called <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> er they all have to have um er the same cover <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="873" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="874" who="S0082">because if there was a major er rail accident er the government wouldn't want to be in a situation where somebody could say ah why are all these people not able to claim? You know <pause dur="short"/> they've all been injured <pause dur="short"/> why are they not able to claim? Um <pause dur="short"/> er because there's no <trunc>insur</trunc></u>
<u n="875" who="S0084">but it's privatized industries that you'd be claiming against</u>
<u n="876" who="S0082">because there's no insurance</u>
<u n="877" who="S0084">though wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="878" who="S0082">yeah</u>
<u n="879" who="S0084">you'd be claiming against er um the</u>
<u n="880" who="S0082">but but because it's a public</u>
<u n="881" who="S0084">the National Rail or whatever</u>
<u n="882" who="S0082">because it's a public service and it was nationalized and</u>

<u n="884" who="S0082">and then it was privatized</u>
<u n="885" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="886" who="S0082">um the government would get some flack <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> and of course there's you know overlooking the political situation you know if you didn't ensure that adequate insurance prevailed then people might be in a situation where if the rail company was teetering on the brink of um insolvency</u>
<u n="887" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="888" who="S0082">you know or</u>
<u n="889" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="890" who="S0082">going out of business and there was a major crash and it was the rail company's fault and there was no money to pay the um kinda injured people</u>

<u n="893" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="894" who="S0082">then of course there'd be a national outcry</u>

<u n="897" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="898" who="S0082">um so my job er a mixed job initially and then my job was to make sure that every rail company had the right sort of cover <pause dur="short"/> and I got to know um not the Rail Regulator who was you know quite high up</u>
