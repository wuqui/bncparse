<u n="1" who="S0103">yeah cos I still help out with the air cadets as a civilian instructor</u>
<u n="2" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="3" who="S0103">and I find that eh sometimes it's a little bit easier a little bit difficult to pick up what the youngsters are saying because they have a slightly different lingo</u>
<u n="4" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="5" who="S0103">for instance if they say something's cool I expect it to be a bit cold <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> But in fact that's not what they mean</u>
<u n="6" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="7" who="S0018">and safe safe means good</u>
<u n="8" who="S0103">oh does it?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0018">yes</u>
<u n="10" who="S0103">oh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> has an Australian cousin who comes over here and he obviously is irritated by his grandchildren's use of the word cool</u>
<u n="11" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="12" who="S0103"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah and he always says but it's not cool</u>
<u n="13" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0018">it's positively boiling</u>
<u n="15" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0018">and so what you also study German you said?</u>
<u n="17" who="S0103">I do a German discussion group once a week</u>
<u n="18" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="19" who="S0103">to try to keep up the German that I learnt when I was travelling to Germany on business</u>
<u n="20" who="S0018">ah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0103">about thirty years ago thirty or forty years ago</u>
<u n="22" who="S0018">and did you?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0103">which is really work around the motor industry so vocabulary and the usage I learned was tended to be a bit on the technical side</u>
<u n="24" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0103">although now they say I've got quite a good vocabulary but I've found it rather difficult to string the words together</u>
<u n="26" who="S0018">well German's quite a complicated language</u>
<u n="27" who="S0103">well it is because of the different tenses</u>
<u n="28" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0103">but I mean for instance if you say the you could say the man bit the dog or the dog bit the man and it it wouldn't matter which way round you put the words</u>
<u n="30" who="S0018">eh huh</u>
<u n="31" who="S0103">because a German would still be able to pick up from the tense whether</u>
<u n="32" who="S0018">ooh</u>
<u n="33" who="S0103">it was the dog or the man that did the biting</u>
<u n="34" who="S0018">of course cos it has all the different</u>
<u n="35" who="S0103">of course you can't</u>
<u n="36" who="S0018">cases</u>
<u n="37" who="S0103">you can't have that in English</u>
<u n="38" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0103">em but eh they say that vocabularies are more important than than grammar</u>
<u n="40" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0103">not <unclear/> for foreigners come over here and they invariably get the grammar wrong but you still understand what they're talking about</u>
<u n="42" who="S0018">yeah the most important thing is to communicate isn't it? I think</u>
<u n="43" who="S0103">yes it is</u>
<u n="44" who="S0018">vocabulary will help you do that more than grammar and how about Portuguese then?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0103">well Portuguese I found very difficult</u>
<u n="46" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="47" who="S0103">I couldn't well I suppose I'm older now and memory doesn't stick quite so well</u>
<u n="48" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0103">but I found it extremely difficult and other people have told me that eh it's not an easy language to learn</u>
<u n="50" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0103">and so I didn't pursue it <pause dur="short"/> I decided that eh</u>
<u n="52" who="S0018">oh no</u>
<u n="53" who="S0103">em too many of them can speak English and they seem to sympathise with the problem and so I get on alright and a lot of the people I mix with over there are English people anyway</u>
<u n="54" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0103">so eh I get by</u>
<u n="56" who="S0018">mm and it's quite similar to Spanish Portuguese</u>
<u n="57" who="S0103">so I believe <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="58" who="S0018">I remember it being quite difficult at the beginning to learn Spanish just cos I <trunc>d</trunc> it's such a wealth different words that don't have any correspondence to English</u>
<u n="59" who="S0103">but I believe Finnish is one of the <trunc>mo</trunc> more difficult ones because I believe there are umpteen different cases in Finnish far more in than other languages <pause dur="short"/> it's quite a  quite a  complex language I believe</u>
<u n="60" who="S0018">oh really? Oof <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="61" who="S0103">but the the other at the the the extreme end of the scale I suppose you've got eh Chinese where</u>
<u n="62" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0103">inflections em come into play</u>
<u n="64" who="S0018">yes and all the different characters</u>
<u n="65" who="S0103">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="66" who="S0018">they the Chinese students that I was working with they said that em they didn't know all <trunc>th</trunc>eir characters of the Chinese language <pause dur="short"/> that it's very difficult to be completely</u>
<u n="67" who="S0103">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0018">knowledgeable about it cos they're so many <pause dur="short"/> our alphabet is quite limited compared to to to theirs</u>
<u n="69" who="S0103">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="70" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> So what else are you enjoying doing during your retirement?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0103">em well my main hobby I suppose is em model flying</u>
<u n="72" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0103">I've built some em model aeroplanes radio-controlled model aeroplanes and em I fly those when the weather is good enough <pause dur="short"/> eh originally they were all em powered by internal combustion engines</u>
<u n="74" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0103">but now electric motors are coming into force and with the improved technology em in battery manufacturers <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> there are more powerful electric motors available and they the batteries will give eh a greater capacity for a given weight</u>
<u n="76" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0103">and that's</u>
<u n="78" who="S0018">how big are they?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0103" trans="overlap">what? The aeroplanes?</u>
<u n="80" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="81" who="S0103">well the the em internal combustion engine sort of  something like a five foot wing span</u>
<u n="82" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="83" who="S0103">em</u>
<u n="84" who="S0018">gosh it's quite large</u>
<u n="85" who="S0103">yes</u>
<u n="86" who="S0018">not bad</u>
<u n="87" who="S0103">yes</u>
<u n="88" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> And where do you?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0103">fortunately I'm breaking fewer of them now</u>
<u n="90" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0103">fingers crossed <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0018">and do you make  do you make  them too?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0103">when I first started I bought kits of balsa and plywood</u>
<u n="94" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0103">and built them from kits but now em it's almost cheaper to buy them built up as almost ready to fly or ARTF em models made in China the Chinese seem to be able to build the complete models so much eh cheaper almost cheaper and you can buy the covering materials for a kit <pause dur="short"/> so that eh most of the ones I build now I build from kits</u>
<u n="96" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0103">or from made up almost ready to fly kits</u>
<u n="98" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0103">but you still have to put the tail plane on and the wings and put all the em the electronic the electrical components in it</u>
<u n="100" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="101" who="S0103">for instance the radio receiver and the servers and operate the flying services</u>
<u n="102" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="103" who="S0103">and the engine</u>
<u n="104" who="S0018">sounds like fun <pause dur="short"/> do you have to paint them too?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0103">no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> they they're usually covered eh in a sort of plasticky material</u>
<u n="106" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="107" who="S0103">and eh <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> you should really eh <trunc>r</trunc> run a warm covering all over them just to tighten the the skin up but em <trunc>t</trunc> they it's reduced a lot of time in constructing them</u>
<u n="108" who="S0018">A where do you go to fly them?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0103">em I belong to two clubs one at <anon type="place"/> eh and em one just north of <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> but the <anon type="place"/> one is threatened by high speed rail</u>
<u n="110" who="S0018">oh what is that?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0103">it's planned to go right across the runway</u>
<u n="112" who="S0018">ooh</u>
<u n="113" who="S0103">that's the new London to Birmingham high speed rail link</u>
<u n="114" who="S0018">that's the <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="115" who="S0103">and it's planned to go on up to Manchester and Leeds and Scotland in the distant future</u>
<u n="116" who="S0018">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> I've heard of that</u>
<u n="117" who="S0103">very controversial</u>
<u n="118" who="S0018">it is</u>
<u n="119" who="S0103">I doubt whether it's viable really <pause dur="short"/> I think it's eh a a a bit of a whim that it could eh be financially viable</u>
<u n="120" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0103">they built one in Holland and I gather that's not eh eh a financial success</u>
<u n="122" who="S0018">no</u>
<u n="123" who="S0103">and we could end up with another millstone round our necks</u>
<u n="124" who="S0018">I believe so and they I thought it was high speed <pause dur="short"/> it would cut <trunc>si</trunc> it would cut significantly the time from London to Birmingham but it doesn't</u>
<u n="125" who="S0103">I don't think it does</u>
<u n="126" who="S0018">it's only about twenty-five minutes faster</u>
<u n="127" who="S0103">there's also some university professor has looked at the em eh the effects on the track of a train travelling at</u>
<u n="128" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0103">the sort of speeds that they're envisaging and he's come to the conclusion that at that speed vibrations will be set up in the rails and that it could be highly dangerous</u>
<u n="130" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="131" who="S0103">so it may well be that em they can't run them as fast as they want to or that they will have to eh strengthen or alter the design of the the the track construction which could put the cost up considerably <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="132" who="S0018">and is it?</u>
<u n="133" who="S0103">I don't know</u>
<u n="134" who="S0018">is it definitely going ahead? They've got the green light?</u>
<u n="135" who="S0103">I think it's envisaged that it will but you never know what opposition groups could drum up to delay it or put it off <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="136" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no I saw a lot of eh people who live in a village that's going to be completely razed down</u>
<u n="137" who="S0103">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0018">I think it was there was a celebrity some Stephen Fry-type character who lived there and was up in arms about it and he was leading the whole demonstration campaign to to debunk the idea that it is actually viable and yeah they they had a lot of different arguments like</u>
<u n="139" who="S0103">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0018">it's not actually faster <pause dur="short"/> it's going to be more costly <pause dur="short"/> it's em I can't remember what the other ones oh <trunc>y</trunc> you're razing down so much of the countryside and of the</u>
<u n="141" who="S0103">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0018">villages</u>
<u n="143" who="S0103">yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0018">the heritage of is it the Chilterns?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0103">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="146" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0103">but they're going to tunnel some of it I think</u>
<u n="148" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0103">at great expense</u>
<u n="150" who="S0018">again <pause dur="short"/> again <pause dur="short"/> well they built one in Spain em eh they just just opened up the Madrid to Valencia high speed train</u>
<u n="151" who="S0103">oh have they?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0018">and well you I think that's more viable because it's a larger country and it has significantly reduced travelling time <pause dur="short"/> but it's only because of the price it's only available to em business people and people who've got a lot of money</u>
<u n="153" who="S0103">well this is what I would have thought about the London to Birmingham one</u>
<u n="154" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0103">it would probably be more viable when it gets eh when it completed and runs right up to Scotland</u>
<u n="156" who="S0018">true</u>
<u n="157" who="S0103">eh it may then compete with eh with flying</u>
<u n="158" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> how long will it take to get from London to?</u>
<u n="159" who="S0103">I don't know what the time is from London to Scotland <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure but eh I doubt it would come in my time to go up and see <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0018">oh of course <pause dur="short"/> she lives up there doesn't she?</u>
<u n="161" who="S0103">she's up there <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0018">how are they getting on?</u>
<u n="163" who="S0103">oh they're getting on alright <pause dur="short"/> the the house is eh not <trunc>comp</trunc> really completed <pause dur="short"/> I mean the construction's done but all the decorating and tidying up hasn't been done and I think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is more concerned about eh keeping the children in activities</u>
<u n="164" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0103">rather than spending their time doing the decorating but eh  but eh  <trunc>t</trunc> they're alright <pause dur="short"/> they've got a field at the back of the house where they've allowed a farmer to put some sheep</u>
<u n="166" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="167" who="S0103">and they're expecting some lambs at the moment</u>
<u n="168" who="S0018">oh lovely</u>
<u n="169" who="S0103">em they've got a barn which eh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> has run some electric out to so that they can see to look after the sheep in the night</u>
<u n="170" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="171" who="S0103">but I don't think any lambs have turned up yet</u>
<u n="172" who="S0018">ooh</u>
<u n="173" who="S0103">and eh I gather that they haven't got the lambs well the <trunc>sh</trunc> and the the <trunc>l</trunc> lambs scans</u>
<u n="174" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0103">they're not really certain which ones are pregnant and which aren't <vocal desc="laugh"/> But I'm going up there on Thursday</u>
<u n="176" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="177" who="S0103">while <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is eh working in Ireland</u>
<u n="178" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="179" who="S0103">eh to help her look after the children while she goes on a em a a diving coach's course</u>
<u n="180" who="S0018">oh wow</u>
<u n="181" who="S0103">at <trunc>E</trunc> at Edinburgh <pause dur="short"/> so she's still keen on the diving <pause dur="short"/> she used to do it in Solihull and then at Sheffield University</u>
<u n="182" who="S0018">mm hm and is she going to become an instructor?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0103">well this is the idea that she at the moment she's doing some em teaching for the eh educational teaching with the local authority</u>
<u n="184" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="185" who="S0103">up there <pause dur="short"/> taking after her mother <pause dur="short"/> and em I think  I think  that eh she felt she was missing out because she wasn't qualified to teach diving</u>
<u n="186" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="187" who="S0103">so she's doing this diving instructors course</u>
<u n="188" who="S0018">so what is she teaching?</u>
<u n="189" who="S0103">diving</u>
<u n="190" who="S0018">oh she's?</u>
<u n="191" who="S0103">and swimming</u>
<u n="192" who="S0018">oh okay swimming <pause dur="short"/> alright</u>
<u n="193" who="S0103">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so she hasn't she's left behind her eh her em eh control systems engineering</u>
<u n="194" who="S0018">oh is that what she was doing?</u>
<u n="195" who="S0103">originally yes because she went to work for National Power</u>
<u n="196" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="197" who="S0103">em and she went through university sponsored by National Power</u>
<u n="198" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0103">and then became a control systems engineer organising the controls of the power station the coal-fired power stations</u>
<u n="200" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="201" who="S0103">and then when she met Alan and he was working at Prestwick on the HMS Gannet Search and Rescue Squadron</u>
<u n="202" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="203" who="S0103">em she em got a job with a sausage skin manufacturing</u>
<u n="204" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="205" who="S0103">firm and did the process control eh computer work for the eh manufacturer of the sausage skins</u>
<u n="206" who="S0018">okay <pause dur="short"/> so it's all done by computer? That kind of <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="207" who="S0103">well the computer controls the the processes</u>
<u n="208" who="S0018">but did she was she being was she very hands on or was she more developing the computer system?</u>
<u n="209" who="S0103">well I think she was eh controlling doing the software that controlled what the machines did</u>
<u n="210" who="S0018">oh wow so it's programming</u>
<u n="211" who="S0103" trans="overlap">Cos she I went up there to see her and she showed me around the factory and she'd kick a panel off a machine and twisted that and that so she obviously knew what the various valves and pipes did but eh</u>
<u n="212" who="S0018">ah <pause dur="short"/> interesting</u>
<u n="213" who="S0103">and we saw all the em leather going in at one end which was a bit noxious</u>
<u n="214" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="215" who="S0103">it was all mixed up and eh mixed in and pumped through a pipe and came out like a long sausage you know a long tube of leather and a long tube of sausage skin it was all folded up backwards and forwards on itself</u>
<u n="216" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="217" who="S0103">ready to go into the em sausage production machines I suppose but</u>
<u n="218" who="S0018">oh lovely <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="219" who="S0103">she reckoned the skins were the best part of the sausages</u>
<u n="220" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="221" who="S0018">what are the sausage skins made out of?</u>
<u n="222" who="S0103">well these particular ones were made of leather</u>
<u n="223" who="S0018">leather?</u>
<u n="224" who="S0103">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="225" who="S0018">ah</u>
<u n="226" who="S0103">animal <vocal desc="cough"/> excuse me animal skins <pause dur="short"/> but eh I'm not certain what eh what type but I think some of them come from all sorts of em construction I'm not really concerned</u>
<u n="227" who="S0018">they're very they were very thin the leather was very thin?</u>
<u n="228" who="S0103">not particularly no it it was all in a big vat and stirred round with paddles</u>
<u n="229" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="230" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> yes I think when you look into how things are made you start finding some of it quite unsavoury <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="231" who="S0103">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="232" who="S0018">I saw a photo of eh some some kind of pink mousse coming out of a you know like a meat grinder?</u>
<u n="233" who="S0103">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="234" who="S0018">and I thought oh what's that? Clicked on it and it was eh something from MacDonald's and I thought</u>
<u n="235" who="S0103">minced beef was it?</u>
<u n="236" who="S0018">no I thought maybe it was em the milkshake that some kind of</u>
<u n="237" who="S0103">oh yes</u>
<u n="238" who="S0018">cos it was very it looked like candy floss a little bit <pause dur="short"/> and I thought oh maybe it's the milkshakes maybe it's ice cream I don't know what is it? Cos it was a lovely pink rose pink hue and it wasn't it was chicken the what goes into the chicken nuggets</u>
<u n="239" who="S0103">oh <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="240" who="S0018">and it's bright pink</u>
<u n="241" who="S0103">and is some of it mechanically removed meat?</u>
<u n="242" who="S0018">well</u>
<u n="243" who="S0103">because I think mechanically removed meat goes into sausages doesn't it? I think</u>
<u n="244" who="S0018">really? I don't know <pause dur="short"/> but what this was</u>
<u n="245" who="S0103">I think <pause dur="short"/> they they get the carcass when they cut the joints off it and then they hose it down with a high pressure jet and what that removes is a sort of sludge of meat off the bones</u>
<u n="246" who="S0018">eh huh</u>
<u n="247" who="S0103">and I think that's mechanically removed meat and it ends up in eh beef burgers and sausages and I'm always a bit suspicious of what</u>
<u n="248" who="S0018">I am completely well this this meat the chicken it was pink because they just put the whole chickens through the grinder <pause dur="short"/> so you've got every single part</u>
<u n="249" who="S0103">you've got the bone in there too have you?</u>
<u n="250" who="S0018">yeah everything of the chicken is goes in the grinder and that's why it comes out pink obviously cos it of the blood</u>
<u n="251" who="S0103">yes</u>
<u n="252" who="S0018">and then they bleach it to make it white</u>
<u n="253" who="S0103">oh my no</u>
<u n="254" who="S0018">and then they add all the cos obviously it tastes foul</u>
<u n="255" who="S0103">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="256" who="S0018">no no pun intended</u>
<u n="257" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="258" who="S0018">and so they bleach it and then they add all these preservatives and flavourings cos obviously it doesn't taste</u>
<u n="259" who="S0103">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="260" who="S0018">like what we know chicken to taste like <pause dur="short"/> so it's they might have they might as well just have got a load of polystyrene instead of chicken</u>
<u n="261" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="262" who="S0018">but yes when you find out what how things are made I don't think I'll ever go back to MacDonald's after that <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="263" who="S0018">so how many children has <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got?</u>
<u n="264" who="S0103">she's got two <pause dur="short"/> she's got a a em a daughter of nine and a son of eh seven</u>

<u n="267" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="268" who="S0103">em <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> can't go because he'll be working in Ireland now he's working for the Irish coastguard</u>
<u n="269" who="S0018">mm hm</u>

<u n="271" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="272" who="S0103">but he'll be away when she's can take the children <pause dur="short"/> so she's going over there on her own with the two children</u>
<u n="273" who="S0018">aw</u>
<u n="274" who="S0103">for a week at the end of the month <pause dur="short"/> so we'll see them then <pause dur="short"/> but I'm going up there on Thursday</u>
<u n="275" who="S0018">mm hm</u>

<u n="279" who="S0018">aw</u>
<u n="280" who="S0103">but eh other than that eh probably about I suppose we do quite well we see her about three three or four times a year I suppose</u>

<u n="291" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="292" who="S0103">so I think it could be some time before they</u>

<u n="310" who="S0018">yes <pause dur="short"/> it's definitely different</u>
<u n="311" who="S0103">but em</u>
<u n="312" who="S0018">to Britain</u>
<u n="313" who="S0103">it's certainly nice to know somebody out there where you can go out for it makes it eh a relatively an inexpensive holiday if all you've got to do is get a cheap flight to Faro and back</u>

<u n="327" who="S0018">just guess</u>
<u n="328" who="S0103">I think I know now what to look for to log on and eh em charge the card with a few more points</u>
<u n="329" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="330" who="S0018">and so the the builder you were talking about? Is he finding does he work in construction?</u>
<u n="331" who="S0103">well he really he had a business over here</u>
<u n="332" who="S0018">ah okay</u>
<u n="333" who="S0103">in engineering</u>
<u n="334" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="335" who="S0103">and eh he went out there and looked for work to do and eh he got to know an Irish builder</u>
<u n="336" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="337" who="S0103">he did work for this Irish builder and in the end it turned out to be a bit of an apprenticeship he branched off doing things himself and</u>
<u n="338" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="339" who="S0103">if he wanted to know how to do it he'd go to this other chap and he's learned that way</u>
<u n="340" who="S0018">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> so he's more of a a solitary builder</u>
<u n="341" who="S0103">em</u>
<u n="342" who="S0018">because the construction business there I've got a lot of friends in Spain that em when they left school they went into the construction industry because there were so many jobs</u>
<u n="343" who="S0103">yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0018">and obviously that was ten years ago when there was a lot of construction</u>
<u n="345" who="S0103">now there aren't a lot of jobs now I suppose?</u>
<u n="346" who="S0018">no <pause dur="short"/> all the banks have stopped funding the constructions and there's no</u>
<u n="347" who="S0103">well there must be loads of empty properties out there</u>
<u n="348" who="S0018">there are <pause dur="short"/> half-built properties empty properties</u>
<u n="349" who="S0103">this is the problem in Ireland <pause dur="short"/> they've</u>
<u n="350" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="351" who="S0103">built and built and built</u>
<u n="352" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="353" who="S0103"><trunc>h</trunc> houses there</u>
<u n="354" who="S0018">yeah</u>

<u n="356" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="357" who="S0103">but em no I was lucky really cos I went over there for a  for a  holiday with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> I was saying that I was doing this model flying well they said oh we've got a friend that eh</u>
<u n="358" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="359" who="S0103">flies model aeroplanes</u>
<u n="360" who="S0018">oh really?</u>
<u n="361" who="S0103">so I'll take you to meet him <pause dur="short"/> so I went over and had a chat with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>

<u n="363" who="S0103">and em <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>h</trunc> he'd flown full size aeroplanes and eh he's a very knowledgeable sort of chap and when I went again they said oh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s now the em the training officer for the <trunc>m</trunc> model flying club <pause dur="short"/> so em I had a word with him and he said oh he'd give me some lessons and he used to come round to the house and pick me up and take me down to the field and put me on a  lead and to em to give me some flying lessons</u>
<u n="364" who="S0018">fantastic</u>
<u n="365" who="S0103">eventually he said go on push off on your own but don't break my plane</u>
<u n="366" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="367" who="S0018">do you take your planes over?</u>

<u n="369" who="S0018">or are you flying his?</u>
<u n="370" who="S0103">in in in effect what happened in the end was that the poor chap died</u>
<u n="371" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="372" who="S0103">and em I came to an arrangement with his widow that I had his trainer and one or two bits and pieces and eh I bought some tools out there and other things I needed</u>
<u n="373" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="374" who="S0103">I kept his plane out there</u>
<u n="375" who="S0018">aw</u>
<u n="376" who="S0103">em but I did have a mishap with it <pause dur="short"/> in landing one of the wings hit a post and broke</u>
<u n="377" who="S0018">oops</u>
<u n="378" who="S0103">so I brought another model out there another trainer and <trunc>b</trunc> built it but then when I got home I found I've got another wing cos I'd had the exactly the same kit at home that I'd used and I'd got a spare wing so I made it up and I managed to get it on the plane out to Portugal <pause dur="short"/> em it came in two halves fortunately so I was able to unbolt the two halves and get them packed up and eh I put them on the special special <trunc>l</trunc> <trunc>pack</trunc> package em counter at Birmingham and picked them up picked it up at Faro and I managed to get it within my baggage allowance</u>
<u n="379" who="S0018">brilliant <pause dur="short"/> it's not too heavy? Well I imagine it can't be too heavy can it?</u>
<u n="380" who="S0103">oh no the it's got to be light stuff so I I got this wing out there within my</u>
<u n="381" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="382" who="S0103">weight allowance</u>
<u n="383" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="384" who="S0103">so the plane's still flying and I've got a spare one</u>
<u n="385" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> It's a good job you've got the hobby of buying model aeroplanes and not sailing boats</u>
<u n="386" who="S0103">yeah but em he had another customer eh or another student that em was a retired mining engineer</u>
<u n="387" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="388" who="S0103">and em I got  I got  to know him and then we used to go down there together <pause dur="short"/> em and now he's em not so keen on doing it anymore and eh</u>
<u n="389" who="S0018">no</u>
<u n="390" who="S0103">but eh <trunc>la</trunc> last well not the last time but the time before last when I went over there they the two flying fields that I used were in a terrible state</u>
<u n="391" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="392" who="S0103">and eh I couldn't get any information from the secretary of the Portuguese club <pause dur="short"/> so em I went into the library at Loulé do you know that part at all?</u>
<u n="393" who="S0018">no <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>w</trunc> what where exactly is it?</u>
<u n="394" who="S0103">em eh well they live at Estoi which is not far from Faro</u>
<u n="395" who="S0018">eh huh</u>
<u n="396" who="S0103">and one of the big towns is Loulé</u>
<u n="397" who="S0018">is that north northern Portugal?</u>
<u n="398" who="S0103">no <pause dur="short"/> no on the em Algarve</u>
<u n="399" who="S0018">southern? Ah okay</u>
<u n="400" who="S0103">em I went into the library and I saw a chap at the desk and I thought well I'll try him <pause dur="short"/> so I said eh oh I said do you speak English? And he said yes in extremely good English and he said can I help you? So I said well I fly model aeroplanes and he he said you do? And then he said I fly model aeroplanes too so he says I said well I I told him what had happened about the two clubs and he knew them the he put me onto another one not but it's on the coast just not far from Faro</u>
<u n="401" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="402" who="S0103">but I found it and em I've I've been I've flown there a few times</u>
<u n="403" who="S0018">super</u>
<u n="404" who="S0103">but it turns out that he em had a a an English father who travelled out to Portugal and was a got a job out there</u>
<u n="405" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="406" who="S0103">and married a Portuguese woman <pause dur="short"/> so he's got a Portuguese mother</u>
<u n="407" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="408" who="S0103">and an English father and he was bilingual and worked in the local library</u>
<u n="409" who="S0018">and he flew model planes</u>
<u n="410" who="S0103">and I'm still in touch with him I went last time I went back I had a a meeting</u>
<u n="411" who="S0018">eh huh</u>
<u n="412" who="S0103">a coffee with him</u>
<u n="413" who="S0018">have you been to fly together?</u>
<u n="414" who="S0103">no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> we haven't managed to do that but em sorry he's em eh he's he's put me in touch with a few things and he's in touch with some people that or he's a member of em a a club out in Portugal that is intending to open out a new model field near Estoi and em it's a ministry defence the Portuguese Ministry of Defence area</u>
<u n="415" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="416" who="S0103">they've got the keys in but that they are now going to develop it but it seems as things are very slow moving</u>
<u n="417" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="418" who="S0103">so I shall continue to whenever I can eh use the the the <trunc>fi</trunc> the field on the marshland near em near Faro</u>
<u n="419" who="S0018">and are the Ministry of Defence going to rope you in to do some spy work for them with your planes?</u>
<u n="420" who="S0103"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I don't think so <pause dur="short"/> but eh things are not very good out in Portugal at the moment</u>
<u n="421" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="422" who="S0103">I think economically they've got their problems</u>
<u n="423" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="424" who="S0103">and em I think it's slow moving out there</u>
<u n="425" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="426" who="S0103">I don't know whether it's the economic situation that's eh slowing it up or what it is</u>
<u n="427" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah well they</u>
<u n="428" who="S0103">but em the first field I went to where Tim used to give me lessons had two runways marked out at right angles so it didn't matter whether you had a north or a south or an east or a west wind</u>
<u n="429" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="430" who="S0103">but this field down by Faro has a north south runway that eh <pause dur="short"/> where you would take off either from the <trunc>s</trunc> sea direction or from the land direction <pause dur="short"/> so if you've got an east west wind em <trunc>y</trunc> you've got a if it's a too strong a cross wind you've got a problem</u>
<u n="431" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="432" who="S0103">so I mean last time I went there there was em eh a a cross wind component and the ground was rather soft <pause dur="short"/> and it was  it was  sandy</u>
<u n="433" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="434" who="S0103">and em the wheels digging into the sand and <trunc>c</trunc> caused quite a bit of a drag</u>
<u n="435" who="S0018">oops</u>
<u n="436" who="S0103">and the less I got em sort of diagonally across the runway into the wind I couldn't get up enough speed to to get the thing off the ground but eh</u>
<u n="437" who="S0018">and do you have you mounted cameras onto it?</u>
<u n="438" who="S0103">I haven't but em members of the model club have eh got hold of old mobile phones with with video cameras in them as a lot have these days and they strap them to the planes and they've got some quite interesting pictures of the area around the field but we're pretty strictly controlled as to where we can fly</u>
<u n="439" who="S0018">right <pause dur="short"/> and it's always within your visual field and it's</u>
<u n="440" who="S0103">well it's got to be <pause dur="short"/> I mean if you could eh people say well what is the range of the transmitter? Well the transmitter is not really the limiting factor <pause dur="short"/> the limiting factor is</u>
<u n="441" who="S0018">how far you can see</u>
<u n="442" who="S0103">how far you can see</u>
<u n="443" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="444" who="S0103">and as you can imagine if you've watched any even real sized flying</u>
<u n="445" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="446" who="S0103">em the attitude of a <trunc>co</trunc> of a plane can be very disorientating</u>
<u n="447" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="448" who="S0103">and you can really not be too certain whether it's coming towards you or going away from you</u>

<u n="450" who="S0103">em</u>
<u n="451" who="S0018">you</u>
<u n="452" who="S0103">and if if if you get it too far away you could easily become disorientated</u>
<u n="453" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="454" who="S0103">em <pause dur="short"/> your <pause dur="short"/> I mean the first thing is is it  is it  coming towards you or is it going away <pause dur="short"/> but you can check that by flicking the the the the stick and see whether it roles to the left or roles to the right <pause dur="short"/> em then if it roles the wrong way you know it's going away from you if it's coming towards you it's alright</u>
<u n="455" who="S0018">and your son-in-law is a pilot isn't he?</u>
<u n="456" who="S0103">he is a search and rescue pilot with the Irish coastguard</u>
<u n="457" who="S0018">and does he enjoy modal aeroplane flying with you or is that like a</u>
<u n="458" who="S0103">no no he doesn't</u>
<u n="459" who="S0018">busman's holiday</u>
<u n="460" who="S0103">no he's not eh <pause dur="short"/> but he <pause dur="short"/> he he was a Royal Naval helicopter pilot and apart from his other other experiences he had he most a lot of his time was spent with search and rescue at I think he did about six years in all during his service at at Prestwick <pause dur="short"/> and em then when he left the Royal Navy he had to requalify as a civilian pilot and eh he got a two year contract with the Irish coastguard <pause dur="short"/> em <pause dur="short"/> the Irish coastguard are upgrading their helicopters and they wanted other contractors to come in a fly the old ones until the their regular crew were trained up to operate the new ones <pause dur="short"/> and then em <pause dur="short"/> they would take over again but they've got four search and rescue bases in Ireland and eh they're going to retrain the crews one after the other <pause dur="short"/> so he should be working four bases one one after the other <pause dur="short"/> and then they've said they'll pay for him to be trained up to operate the new helicopter <pause dur="short"/> and the he</u>
<u n="461" who="S0018">does he just pilot helicopters? Or planes as well?</u>
<u n="462" who="S0103">yes oh yes yeah <pause dur="short"/> and the Irish say that excuse me <vocal desc="cough"/> if you're you can only be qualified to fly on fly one type of helicopter at a time <pause dur="short"/> whereas when he left the Navy he he was em <pause dur="short"/> he got qualifications and he was passed to fly about three different types of helicopter <pause dur="short"/> he had to get the qualifications and then go to the civil aviation authority at Gatwick and get them to mark up his papers to say he was qualified for each type I think it was the the the em the twin <pause dur="short"/> I think it was the em the Single Squirrel and the em em Griffin which is a bell helicopter <pause dur="short"/> and then there was the Sea King and em one other I'm not certain what that was</u>
<u n="463" who="S0018">and what will happen after two years?</u>
<u n="464" who="S0103">well he'll look for another job but he was hoping that he'd be able to em get a job with the eh <trunc>se</trunc> search and rescue back here or in Scotland when the government civilianised it <pause dur="short"/> because there's been talk for some time em about em civilianising the search and rescue operation of the RAF the Royal Navy and the Coastguard <pause dur="short"/> you've got all those people three people operating it at the moment</u>
<u n="465" who="S0018">is it at the moment it's military?</u>
<u n="466" who="S0103">em well it it the R the RAF and the Royal Navy are military and then you've got eh the coastguard operating over here as well <pause dur="short"/> em but it all fell through there was some hitch <pause dur="short"/> and em so that didn't come off but he got the job with the Irish coastguard <pause dur="short"/> and the Irish coastguard operators I think were also operating the <trunc>co</trunc> are the coastguard in eh coastguard service over here but <pause dur="short"/> I think some contract has been lost <pause dur="short"/> I'm not really certain actually what's happened <pause dur="short"/> but anyway hopefully he'll be able to pick up a em flying job back in Scotland</u>
<u n="467" who="S0018">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> fingers crossed</u>
<u n="468" who="S0103">after all the em somewhat hairy flights he does eh in</u>
<u n="469" who="S0018">really? Are they?</u>
<u n="470" who="S0103">search and rescue I don't think he would really be very keen on doing he sort of bus stop flying that the people flying out to the oil rigs would be doing <pause dur="short"/> because he has to make some quite difficult decisions in difficult weather conditions <pause dur="short"/> and eh you know with range and fuel and what you can do in different weather conditions and balancing eh eh the <trunc>se</trunc> or taking advice on how seriously ill somebody is and whether he would eh kill them <trunc>tak</trunc> taking a short route or let them survive by taking a  taking a  long round trip</u>
<u n="471" who="S0018">oh dear <pause dur="short"/> yeah one of mum's friend's daughters was working in Portland Bell?</u>
<u n="472" who="S0103">yeah</u>
<u n="473" who="S0018">she was coordinating the the search and rescue</u>
<u n="474" who="S0103">oh was she? Oh</u>
<u n="475" who="S0018">but unfortunately they're going to close down that one</u>
<u n="476" who="S0103">are they?</u>
<u n="477" who="S0018">yeah but she she has some stories <pause dur="short"/> she she was on the phone well on the CB or whatever it is to em a small child who said look my father has got his hand stuck in some of machinery in the boat</u>
<u n="478" who="S0103">oh god</u>
<u n="479" who="S0018">I don't know what to do <pause dur="short"/> can you help me? And she was talking the kid through the whole scenario <pause dur="short"/> but in the end his father died</u>
<u n="480" who="S0103">oh</u>
<u n="481" who="S0018">and she said she was absolutely <pause dur="short"/> you know really traumatised by it</u>
<u n="482" who="S0103">well I know he had one case where he had to collect em I think it was a premature baby from somewhere up in <trunc>In</trunc> Inverness way <pause dur="short"/> and take them to hospital in Glasgow <pause dur="short"/> and the weather was pretty awful <pause dur="short"/> and they said well you're going a long way round <pause dur="short"/> so he said well do you want to get there alive? I think he flew down the Caledonian canal and round the west coast and then up the Cylde <pause dur="short"/> he had to go under the Erskine bridge and then climb up and go over some power cables and <pause dur="short"/> I I you know I it it it's that sort of hairy flying and eh that make it interesting and eh <pause dur="short"/> I don't think that flying an airliner or em a helicopter out to oil rigs and back would be it it would that would be a bit too routine for him I think</u>
<u n="483" who="S0018">he wants the excitement</u>
<u n="484" who="S0103">so it's not just sea rescue then it's also land emergencies?</u>
<u n="485" who="S0018">no they have to do the em the eh highlands of <trunc>Sc</trunc> Scotland as well <pause dur="short"/> well they go there's another eh search and rescue at Lossiemouth so they would go part of the way and Lossiemouth would come down and <pause dur="short"/> there's there's a em an organisation em there is the the the air  the air  sea rescue central control I think is at Kinloss <pause dur="short"/> and I think Kinloss sorts out which one is going to do which</u>
<u n="486" who="S0103">could he not join the coastguard in in view of the fact that it it hasn't been civilianised <pause dur="short"/> could he not join the coastguard and continue</u>
<u n="487" who="S0018">well it's a question of <pause dur="short"/> well he could do I <pause dur="short"/> he could do but eh it all depends when he's finished his eh session with the the Irish whether that organisation will want pilots <pause dur="short"/> so you don't know what's going to happen and it'll be another eighteen months I should think before he's looking <pause dur="short"/> so we'll have to see what happens</u>
<u n="488" who="S0018">prince William is a search and rescue pilot isn't he?</u>

<u n="491" who="S0103">em <pause dur="short"/> he doesn't talk about it <pause dur="short"/> but I think they have because he was eh <pause dur="short"/> before <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> went and did his last trip at to Prestwick <pause dur="short"/> em he was a flying instructor at the tri services helicopter training base at Shawbury <pause dur="short"/> and he was on the sixty squadron which is where Prince William was <pause dur="short"/> I suspect he knows him and I suspect that eh but he he it's a closed book you know you they don't talk about em</u>

<u n="537" who="S0103">well he developed an interest in this when he was in the RAF through what he regarded as the difficulty is using em NATO stock number to control the quality and whereabouts of various bits and pieces <pause dur="short"/> so he's made a bit of a <trunc>st</trunc> he made a bit of a study of NATO stock numbers <pause dur="short"/> and eh he's been em had this as a bit of a hobby horse <pause dur="short"/> but he's got em em a a a deal with Bombardier the train manufacturer <pause dur="short"/> well they make aeroplanes as well but on the  on the  rail side for doing an exercise for them on controlling their components</u>

<u n="540" who="S0018">interesting <pause dur="short"/> I don't <pause dur="short"/> some of the jobs that people have I wonder how did they  how did they  discover that job?</u>
<u n="541" who="S0103" trans="overlap">well I think one of the problems is that it isn't a very well documented subject</u>
<u n="542" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="543" who="S0103">and because of that there isn't a lot that he can kind to read up about it <pause dur="short"/> so most of his work is is original work</u>
<u n="544" who="S0018">research and things <pause dur="short"/> interesting</u>
<u n="545" who="S0103">but anyway it <pause dur="short"/> he he's finding it quite stimulating I think</u>

<u n="555" who="S0103">and we stopped and had a meal at a pub and then got a taxi home <pause dur="short"/> they said oh it's only across the field I said yes I know we</u>
<u n="556" who="S0018">how long did that take you sixteen hours what sixteen miles sorry</u>

<u n="679" who="S0103">yes yes we take the car <pause dur="short"/> we take a car the two cars <pause dur="short"/> leave a car at one end of the walk and then another one at the other end <pause dur="short"/> then do the walk and then go back and pick the other car up</u>
<u n="680" who="S0018">ah ha <pause dur="short"/> what a good idea</u>
<u n="681" who="S0103">well we we did that we we did that on most of the Cotswold Way and on the Offa's Dyke walk <pause dur="short"/> but em with the Offa's Dyke walk it was a little bit further away from home and we could we sometimes took one car and parked it at the end of the walk and then got a taxi to the beginning of the walk <pause dur="short"/> and then we would walk back to the car <pause dur="short"/> em at that time we had a dog and we were taking the dog with us so we had to get the taxi at the beginning <pause dur="short"/> because the taxi wouldn't have wanted a filthy wet dog in the car at the end of the walk</u>
<u n="682" who="S0018">what kind of dog did you have?</u>
<u n="683" who="S0103">well it was a Collie cross</u>
<u n="684" who="S0018">ah <pause dur="short"/> I don't remember you having a dog</u>
<u n="685" who="S0103">Don't you? It was a black collie cross</u>
<u n="686" who="S0018">aw <pause dur="short"/> and do you usually go and eat in a a country pub after your walks</u>
<u n="687" who="S0103">well sometimes if we've got time we'll stop and have a a beer in the middle of the day but we usually reckon to come home in the evening and eh get something to eat in the evening</u>
<u n="688" who="S0018">oh <pause dur="short"/> when I was living in Barcelona there's a lot of hills and good walks around there <pause dur="short"/> em and you can catch the metro out to the last stop on the line and that's already in Collserola which is like the hilly area <pause dur="short"/> and but the only reason I'd do the walks is if there was a big lunch in a farmhouse in a restaurant farmhouse somewhere so it's like okay right yeah I can walk for four hours as long as I'm walking towards lunch</u>
<u n="689" who="S0103">well Valerie and I went with some friends for a holiday in the Costa Brava before we got married and eh stayed at Le Franc I don't know if you've ever come across that?</u>
<u n="690" who="S0018">yeah uh-huh</u>
<u n="691" who="S0103">and we had a few days in Barcelona</u>
<u n="692" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="693" who="S0103">and em <pause dur="short"/> I seem to remember we got a there were a <pause dur="short"/> I think there were about eight of us <pause dur="short"/> and we got a taxi to a monastery above Barcelona and they they produce a a liquor up there and</u>
<u n="694" who="S0018">was it Tibidabu?</u>
<u n="695" who="S0103">I can't remember</u>
<u n="696" who="S0018">was it quite close to Barcelona</u>
<u n="697" who="S0103">oh yes it wasn't far</u>
<u n="698" who="S0018">I think they make hazelnut liquor</u>
<u n="699" who="S0103">do they? Is that what it was I can't remember</u>
<u n="700" who="S0018">could be <pause dur="short"/> I I don't <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember either but yes <pause dur="short"/> they keep the  they keep the  monks busy making alcohol <pause dur="short"/> but em have you been back since?</u>
<u n="701" who="S0103">no</u>
<u n="702" who="S0018">no? It's changed an awful lot <pause dur="short"/> cos it's been an Olympic city since then as well hasn't it?</u>
<u n="703" who="S0103">yes and em the em I should think it's probably very much more built up now <pause dur="short"/> probably a bit like a concrete jungle</u>
<u n="704" who="S0018">well I got the impression living there that it was being turned into Disneyland</u>
<u n="705" who="S0103">oh is it yeah</u>
<u n="706" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="707" who="S0103">but eh even going to when I'm in Portugal I notice the amount of building that's going on there is enormous <pause dur="short"/> whether they're selling the places or not I don't know</u>
<u n="708" who="S0018">I doubt it <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't be surprised if all the building construction work stopped em <pause dur="short"/> they've got no funding for it and no demand for it <pause dur="short"/> once it's finished</u>
<u n="709" who="S0103">they seem to be keeping out of the deep trouble that Greece is in but eh</u>
<u n="710" who="S0018">yeah although only just I think <pause dur="short"/> but em they were defaulting on their debt weren't they last year?</u>
<u n="711" who="S0103">I think so mm</u>
<u n="712" who="S0018">so</u>
<u n="713" who="S0103">well I didn't realise it but on the Euro notes there's a letter in front of the serial number which</u>
<u n="714" who="S0018">that's right</u>
<u n="715" who="S0103">designates the country that's issued it <pause dur="short"/> and I think the advice is avoid the Greek ones <pause dur="short"/> cos they were changed to Drachmas</u>
<u n="716" who="S0018">right yes</u>
<u n="717" who="S0103">did you know this did you?</u>
<u n="718" who="S0018">yeah no I know that the there was the issuing country identified but <pause dur="short"/> yeah mum and dad are going to Greece in June so</u>
