<u n="58" who="S0255">do you get the government ones saying that you're entitled to a new boiler and</u>
<u n="59" who="S0319" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0255">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0319">get all that crap and sometimes when I'm there I get it and I'll answer it and then it's the <trunc>au</trunc>automated</u>
<u n="62" who="S0255" trans="overlap">I know <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0319">but it's filling up my answerphone</u>
<u n="64" who="S0255">yeah I know I find that you come in and there's a message and you know what it's gonna be</u>
<u n="65" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0255">it's just it's annoying so annoying</u>
<u n="67" who="S0319" trans="overlap">er but I rang up to find out how I could stop it er and BT were like oh yeah we can stop that I'm like I mean no problem it's gonna cost you I think it was like something three pounds something or whatever more a month</u>
<u n="68" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0319">er and I'm thinking but it's getting that bad now where I think I might do it</u>
<u n="70" who="S0255">the trouble is though it it comes up as international calls and withheld numbers and unavailable numbers so actually <trunc>ho</trunc> they can't block all those cos that would mean you wouldn't be able to get any phone calls say if the council rang you for something or if something a lot of places businesses ring and their numbers are withheld</u>
<u n="71" who="S0319">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0255">and then they can't ring the people because it's all on</u>
<u n="73" who="S0319">yeah ah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0255">are you on the telephone preference service?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0255">yeah yeah cos we're on that as well</u>
<u n="77" who="S0319">but it's a waste of time</u>
<u n="78" who="S0255">mm well I I think the ones when if it comes through with a number I mean I've got on my actual phone I can block numbers</u>
<u n="79" who="S0319">yeah I can on my mobile</u>
<u n="80" who="S0255" trans="overlap">so if anything comes through with a number no on the actual phone phone on this one</u>
<u n="81" who="S0319">oh</u>
<u n="82" who="S0255">I've got it on here look I can go in and just on the settings <pause dur="short"/> caller barred</u>
<u n="83" who="S0319" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0255">so if anything comes up with a number I <trunc>a</trunc> I can just put it in that</u>
<u n="85" who="S0319">and then it</u>
<u n="86" who="S0255">so that blocks it</u>
<u n="87" who="S0319">oh mind you our phones are old so that's probably why but I could do it on my mobile</u>
<u n="88" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but a lot of the time now it just but it just comes through with the <trunc>un</trunc>unavailable or international or withheld</u>
<u n="89" who="S0319" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0255">so actually that wouldn't stop because you can't stop the erm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0319" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="92" who="S0255">the things</u>
<u n="93" who="S0319">there used to be something years ago though cos I done it for nana and grandad when they was both alive so I am going back a while</u>
<u n="94" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0319">er that <pause dur="short"/> your phone number</u>
<u n="96" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0319">for you to be able to ring certain people if they'd got this thingy on you had a code that you had to put in front when you rang the number</u>
<u n="98" who="S0255" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="99" who="S0319">so then that way the call would then come through to that person</u>
<u n="100" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="101" who="S0319">because they'd got like a block on their phone</u>
<u n="102" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="103" who="S0319">but <pause dur="short"/> I don't know they don't seem to do that now but I remember doing that cos we used to have to put a number like <pause dur="short"/> I don't know four eight and then put nana and grandad's number and then the call would go through to them</u>
<u n="104" who="S0255" trans="overlap">okay <pause dur="short"/> oh right that's good <trunc>s</trunc>so it's only certain people could read them</u>
<u n="105" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0255">that's good yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0319">er so then like all them businesses you see they couldn't get through because they haven't got the number in front er</u>
<u n="108" who="S0255">no that's a good idea</u>
<u n="109" who="S0319">anyway deary me</u>
<u n="110" who="S0255">right so ahem</u>
<u n="111" who="S0319">I've had a shower this morning mind you I've been into the market</u>
<u n="112" who="S0255">you don't smell</u>
<u n="113" who="S0319">no don't I can't you even smell my perfume oh Christ that's bad</u>
<u n="114" who="S0255">no I can't smell your perfume</u>
<u n="115" who="S0319">oh</u>
<u n="116" who="S0255">what is it you're wearing?</u>
<u n="117" who="S0319">Kylie Minogue</u>
<u n="118" who="S0255">oh I don't wear perfume not at all</u>
<u n="119" who="S0319">er</u>
<u n="120" who="S0255">sounds daft but I get fed up of the smell</u>
<u n="121" who="S0319">now you see I can never smell it so I I'm like this and I'm like</u>
<u n="122" who="S0255">you put more and more on</u>
<u n="123" who="S0319">yeah sometimes I can be a bit</u>
<u n="124" who="S0255">people say oh put different ones on different days but I <trunc>a</trunc> what I mean <trunc>i</trunc> I spray <trunc>perfu</trunc> if I spray perfume on about an hour later I think god I can still smell that smell and it annoys me that I can smell it so I <trunc>d</trunc> I don't wear it at all</u>
<u n="125" who="S0319">well I have to spray it so it's on my clothes</u>
<u n="126" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0319">cos if I do it round the neck and what have you</u>
<u n="128" who="S0255">yeah do you get a rash?</u>
<u n="129" who="S0319">it yeah er and cos I used to do it they used to tell you to put it here and here and rub together</u>
<u n="130" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0319">and then I got told that you should put it behind the backs of your knees as well</u>
<u n="132" who="S0255">yeah the idea is you put it on a pulse so you put it on the wrist but you shouldn't even rub perfume because it breaks down the erm the thing of it changes the smell</u>
<u n="133" who="S0319">oh <unclear/> like this</u>
<u n="134" who="S0255">so you should just just spray it on and just</u>
<u n="135" who="S0319">I started them coming up and what have you and everything so I thought oh I'll erm spray it on my clothes</u>
<u n="136" who="S0255" trans="overlap">spray it on your clothes mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0319">so</u>
<u n="138" who="S0255">okay so jeans</u>
<u n="139" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0255">erm so where do you normally get your jeans from?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0319">well I haven't bought jeans well apart from those ones I've done on Ebay</u>
<u n="142" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0319">I couldn't tell you how many years ago it was that I bought jeans cos I went into Primark er and I just get these jeggings</u>
<u n="144" who="S0255" trans="overlap">jeggings yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0319">and that's all I've been really having</u>
<u n="146" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="147" who="S0319">erm so the jeans that I had in my wardrobe I wouldn't even know where I'd got them from how long I'd had them</u>
<u n="148" who="S0255">no that's fine what we'll do is we'll start on ASOS because I tend to buy things off ASOS erm Mango Oasis places like that and then I look out particularly if they've got sales on because the they can be quite expensive erm I'll tell you another Wallis I get <trunc>alo</trunc> my skinny jeans are from Wallis and you can get them in black erm <trunc>bl</trunc> all different <trunc>blu</trunc> all different blues and different colours as well so they might be worth looking at as well</u>
<u n="149" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0255">and with Wallis if you when you send for it it's sort of I think I'm not sure if it's about three pound for delivery but it's free return and</u>
<u n="151" who="S0319">oh that's good</u>
<u n="152" who="S0255">so that's yeah that's the thing you want to watch up cos if you start buying like I buy everything online and then I send loads of stuff back</u>
<u n="153" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0255">but I always look and find the people that give you free returns</u>
<u n="155" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0255">er like ASOS which isn't loading with ASOS I pay I think it's about fourteen pound a year but that means I get free next day delivery free returns erm and also get a like advance of different sales and extra money off things et cetera so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> uses it as well she will</u>
<u n="157" who="S0319">I was going to say <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s told me about them and what have you and I've had a look on theirs</u>
<u n="158" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="159" who="S0319">er and one of my dresses that I've got is erm <pause dur="short"/> from them as well</u>
<u n="160" who="S0255">yeah they're good</u>
<u n="161" who="S0319">actually I think I got two dresses summer dresses</u>
<u n="162" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0319">but see it's now going into winter and I got no winterwear</u>
<u n="164" who="S0255">yeah well it's up to fifty percent off sale jeans</u>
<u n="165" who="S0319">oh</u>
<u n="166" who="S0255">so let's let's start on that then and er okay let's go size fourteen do that do that go on yeah let's make this even bigger mind you it's a bit deceiving you do that and actually it's just white at the sides so that's gonna make my eyes go buzz eyed</u>
<u n="167" who="S0319">well</u>
<u n="168" who="S0255">do that if that's alright that's the easiest easy enough to see isn't it? okay so that</u>
<u n="169" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0255">erm and how many is that two hundred and thirty-one styles so we'll look at them all and just see so I mean stuff like that is no good with the rips and stuff in and like unless you want rips to me I just think that's a bit</u>
<u n="171" who="S0319">well you can do that yourself and I mean like round here and what have you men it tends to rip quite easy cos they're forever scratching aren't they?</u>
<u n="172" who="S0255">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> so like those ones</u>
<u n="173" who="S0319">oh they're yeah</u>
<u n="174" who="S0255">see they're nice they're slim</u>
<u n="175" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0255">and they're quite high waist</u>
<u n="177" who="S0319">and high</u>
<u n="178" who="S0255">so I always do middle high waist because the low rise ones that's fine for kids but I don't think that's right so</u>
<u n="179" who="S0319">no</u>
<u n="180" who="S0255">I'll tell you what we'll this with ASOS I I'll just get <trunc>thi</trunc> I'll just get them and then they'll come tomorrow erm you can try then and <trunc>the</trunc> then whatever you want to keep or don't I can send back and you just pay me for anything you want to keep</u>
<u n="181" who="S0319">okey-dokey</u>
<u n="182" who="S0255">I think that'll be the easiest way to do this cos then</u>
<u n="183" who="S0319">do they have like leg lengths?</u>
<u n="184" who="S0255">er no just the size</u>
<u n="185" who="S0319">ah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0255">but but I <trunc>te</trunc> oh yes they do</u>
<u n="187" who="S0319">oh</u>
<u n="188" who="S0255">okay sorry take it back</u>
<u n="189" who="S0319">oh crikey where's the right</u>
<u n="190" who="S0255">trouble is when you get into the sale thing is quite a lot of things aren't available so erm thirty we were saying thirty-four see thirty-four inch waist</u>
<u n="191" who="S0319">is sixteen</u>
<u n="192" who="S0255">that's a sixteen</u>
<u n="193" who="S0319">so it can't be so I want a</u>
<u n="194" who="S0255">so you really want to be a thirty-two</u>
<u n="195" who="S0319">ah</u>
<u n="196" who="S0255">yeah?</u>
<u n="197" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0255">so if you're thirty-two</u>
<u n="199" who="S0319">and the thirty-two leg</u>
<u n="200" who="S0255">thirty-two length that's the <trunc>nor</trunc> that's a like a standard</u>
<u n="201" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="202" who="S0255">see these are these are a thirty-two</u>
<u n="203" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="204" who="S0255">yeah? and how long are your legs compared to mine?</u>
<u n="205" who="S0319"><unclear/></u>
<u n="206" who="S0255">stand up and be counted yeah hip to hip so we're about the same length of leg so a thirty-two would be fine for you because then it's just sort of here so it means if you're wearing it even with Converse trainers or your Doc Martens that would be fine</u>

<u n="233" who="S0255">yeah? so now I've found when I send for jeans sometimes it'll be a size ten and I can't get it up over just over my knees and I can't get it any higher and I'm thinking what? and then other times a ten it fits fine and sometimes it's big so this is why I tend to order a lot of stuff and it's like when you're at a shop remember we went to Primark that time and you went in with about six trolleys worth to try on and you went home with about five trolleys worth of stuff</u>
<u n="234" who="S0319">mm</u>
<u n="235" who="S0255">when I get loads of them and I'll <trunc>li</trunc> try on try on try on and out of eight pairs of jeans I might send for I'll keep one or maybe two and then but you've got the choice rather than getting them oh they're no good send them back try another pair send them I just think right it's like are you</u>
<u n="236" who="S0319">so it's with ASOS</u>
<u n="237" who="S0255">yeah</u>

<u n="240" who="S0319">and then you get them er</u>
<u n="241" who="S0255">pay for them send them back and then</u>
<u n="242" who="S0319">and then if whatever you send back and then they credit you</u>
<u n="243" who="S0255">so <trunc>ho</trunc> do they credit you or do they put the money back into your bank?</u>
<u n="244" who="S0319">erm well I pay with PayPal you got PayPal?</u>
<u n="245" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="246" who="S0319">yeah I pay with PayPal and they just put it back into PayPal and then you go into PayPal and you draw it</u>
<u n="247" who="S0255">ah and then you yeah</u>
<u n="248" who="S0319">et cetera I've usually spent it I'd spend it on other stuff so I tend to just</u>
<u n="249" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="250" who="S0319">unless I if I if I bought a lot if I bought sort of three hundred pounds of stuff and then I send loads of it back and I've got two hundred pound credit I'll go into PayPal and get it back out but if it's twenty thirty quid it just tends to</u>
<u n="251" who="S0255">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="252" who="S0319">ah so some of these places then they do use PayPal</u>
<u n="253" who="S0255">yeah ASOS almost almost all the places I've shopped through again they use PayPal</u>
<u n="254" who="S0319">yeah I like using PayPal</u>
<u n="255" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0319">yeah oh look normal jeans that go round your waist</u>
<u n="257" who="S0255">see exactly yeah this this is what I</u>
<u n="258" who="S0319">you see cos that's really difficult to find them in the shop</u>
<u n="259" who="S0255">yeah I know I know it's just a fashion of what it actually is but see look these are twenty-one pound now</u>
<u n="260" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="261" who="S0255">so add that to the bag okay so that's in my bag and we'll go back and then see what else there is so right so there's those ones just shout if you spot any or I'll just like some of these like the tight skinny ones I I find normally things like that they'd be the ones you struggle to get on cos I</u>
<u n="262" who="S0319">yeah I wouldn't want tight skinny ones</u>
<u n="263" who="S0255">no</u>
<u n="264" who="S0319">I have skinny jeans but tight skinny jeans I you might as well just wear tights so</u>
<u n="265" who="S0255">right so that's</u>
<u n="266" who="S0319">that</u>
<u n="267" who="S0255">those ones you were looking at or which ones</u>

<u n="272" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="273" who="S0319">then but they're enough the same colour as what them other ones were aren't they?</u>
<u n="274" who="S0255">yeah but but there might be an option for a different colour in two colours</u>
<u n="275" who="S0319">oh</u>
<u n="276" who="S0255">light or dark but to be fair if you if you send for this and the others only one of them might suit or might fit so out of the two you'd probably keep one although these are fifteen quid and the others are twenty so actually if they're both right you might think okay I've got two decent pairs of jeans now</u>
<u n="277" who="S0319">yeah</u>
<u n="278" who="S0255">you know and so</u>
