<u n="2365" who="S0369">you're there that's Italy you've arrived that's it it's Italy</u>
<u n="2366" who="S0252" trans="overlap">yes but when because we're wanting to be a bit further south than sort of Tuscany</u>
<u n="2367" who="S0368">mm</u>
<u n="2368" who="S0252">it's we can't do that in one day from <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="2370" who="S0252">so if you wanted to do Tuscany you would <trunc>ei</trunc>either need to stay in Ashford the night before to catch the first train of the day at six twenty-eight</u>
<u n="2371" who="S0368">oh right <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="2372" who="S0252">but essentially the journey would be would be to Paris and then there's a train from Paris to Milan on TGV</u>
<u n="2373" who="S0368">oh right</u>
<u n="2374" who="S0252" trans="overlap">and then the Italian</u>
<u n="2375" who="S0368">mm</u>
<u n="2376" who="S0252">Eurostar services</u>

<u n="2380" who="S0252">I might try the train going and the plane coming back but</u>
<u n="2381" who="S0368">mm</u>
<u n="2382" who="S0252">I'm I think the train both ways would be just a bit tricky because</u>
<u n="2383" who="S0368" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2384" who="S0252">some sad reason really there seems to be a bit of tension between the French railway operator and the Italian railway operator</u>

<u n="2386" who="S0252">so it means the Italian railway operator have given er the French their er operator very poor slots</u>
<u n="2387" who="S0368">oh yeah</u>
<u n="2388" who="S0252">so it's</u>

<u n="2390" who="S0252">just hasn't</u>
<u n="2391" who="S0368" trans="overlap">mm bit tricky</u>

<u n="2393" who="S0368">mm</u>
<u n="2394" who="S0252">and only three services a day as well so</u>
<u n="2395" who="S0368" trans="overlap">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="2396" who="S0252">but it does take seven hours and two minutes</u>

<u n="2404" who="S0252" trans="overlap">such a steep gradient</u>

<u n="2481" who="S0252">to</u>
<u n="2482" who="S0368" trans="overlap">Luton</u>

<u n="2489" who="S0368">oh right that's good yeah</u>
<u n="2490" who="S0252">I've planned because <pause dur="short"/> it just makes the holiday a good couple of hundred more if you have those</u>
<u n="2491" who="S0368">yeah</u>
<u n="2492" who="S0252" trans="overlap">airport hotel stays</u>

<u n="2501" who="S0368">oh would you? <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="2502" who="S0252">it could be London the advantage of Ashford is that you can get up a little bit later because the train's got to travel from London to Ashford</u>
<u n="2503" who="S0368">oh yeah yeah</u>

<u n="2508" who="S0252">I know <pause dur="short"/> so if it's six twenty-eight you need half an hour check-in so you'd need to be there at five fifty and then you need to leave the hotel</u>
<u n="2509" who="S0368">mm</u>
<u n="2510" who="S0252">twenty minutes so it would be five thirty</u>
<u n="2511" who="S0368">yeah</u>
