<u n="1071" who="S0262">reality or multiple realities into a storyline that kind of would be viable and I would say viable and I would say very entertaining so lots of your ideas and lots of how you look for things</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah but I'm doing I'm doing this as a fiction</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0262">yeah exactly it is fiction</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0262">that's right and and that's how you're transplanting your truth your search</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0262">for truth into the <trunc>fic</trunc> into fiction</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0262">erm so that's why I can understand who these people who you talk to who said that they wanted to change you know</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0262">the whole <vocal desc="laugh"/> the</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0372" trans="overlap">but <trunc>act</trunc></u>
<u n="1083" who="S0262" trans="overlap">whole idea the premise of it</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0372" trans="overlap">they actually travelled on a Saturday morning</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0372" trans="overlap">to make Gatwick Airport a half past seven to talk to me about the changes</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0262">yeah the I</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0372" trans="overlap">and I sent them the changes</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0262" trans="overlap">say that just it's like they don't get it</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0372" trans="overlap">and never heard another dickybird</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0262">maybe they just thought it was too hot to handle</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0372" trans="overlap">I don't know</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that they personally couldn't</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah well</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0262" trans="overlap">see a way to</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0372" trans="overlap">well they could have easily could have turned around and said well you know <trunc>s</trunc> thanks for nothing</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0372">but nothing</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0372">zilch</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0262">yeah yeah no that is very weird well I think you just sort of put that aside</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0262">and just forget about it</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0372">move away from it</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0262">but erm in terms of well certainly you're rewriting at the moment and it's gonna be a lot shorter from what you're telling me</u>
<u n="1106" who="S0372">no it's gonna be about a hundred and fifty pages shorter</u>
<u n="1107" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="1108" who="S0372" trans="overlap">it's gonna be about four hundred and fifty pages</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0372">er but it's a lot punchier it's a lot faster</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0372">erm <pause dur="short"/> it's a lot bloodier</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0372">there's like twenty-five thousand dead</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0372" trans="overlap">in the London blast alone</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0372">erm and then forty-five thousand dead a month in England from the flu virus</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0262">mm mm that's a lot of CGI if you're thinking of translating that into you know but that's all doable these days I mean</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0262">but yeah so the I guess once you've finished that when you've finished the book or when I don't know how you're thinking of doing it but what I would advise you to advise anyway if you wanted to <trunc>pers</trunc> you know proceed with the idea of making into something audio visual film erm would be to write a treatment for it</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0372">okay</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0262">yeah okay</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0372" trans="overlap">what's that? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1125" who="S0262">so the three major documents in film</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0262">is you have a synopsis which is the shortest</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0262">so that's for the busy you know Hollywood exec who just goes I can't be bothered to read it</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0262">it's like two paragraphs then you</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0372" trans="overlap">it's your your elevator pitch</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0262">yes exactly</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0372" trans="overlap">the ten seconds you've got to</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0262" trans="overlap">while you have your pitch line</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0372" trans="overlap">get them interested</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0262">and then you have</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0262" trans="overlap">your synopsis and then</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0262" trans="overlap">your treatment might be three or four pages which is the basic outline of the story and then after that you'll have your script so that will be your drafted script and that's the that's the documentation that you need with producers</u>
<u n="1142" who="S0372" trans="overlap">that's like the book</u>
<u n="1143" who="S0262">yes it's like the book but obviously</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0262">mostly dialogue</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0372" trans="overlap">well I mean</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1150" who="S0372" trans="overlap">the book is mostly dialogue anyway</u>
<u n="1151" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah that's that's what I thought</u>
<u n="1152" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1153" who="S0262">which was really good so erm so the treatment is the thing that I suppose <pause dur="short"/> in a way is the the thing between the synopsis and the pitch the elevator pitch and the actual script and the treatment is probably the most important part because if you're a busy <trunc>s</trunc> producer associate producer that's the document you would probably spend most time on</u>
<u n="1154" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0262">because you're not yet committed to reading the script cos you can imagine how many scripts they get</u>
<u n="1156" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1157" who="S0262">you're not committed to reading it but you're interested enough to know how the story will come out you know you will read it to the end and find out what what the ending is so</u>
<u n="1158" who="S0372">but do you think Hollywood are gonna be interested in duplicitous American conspiracies?</u>
<u n="1159" who="S0262">mm <pause dur="short"/> well this is what I was asking about your search for truth and your write for fiction but sometimes I guess what touches a nerve with some people is that it's a little bit too close to the bone <pause dur="short"/> so if you scale it back into something that is adaptable</u>
<u n="1160" who="S0372" trans="overlap">well I mean the the the quiet way has got it's not the American duplicity</u>
<u n="1161" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no it's not yeah</u>
<u n="1162" who="S0372" trans="overlap">no this one</u>
<u n="1163" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1164" who="S0372" trans="overlap">is gonna be</u>
<u n="1165" who="S0262">yeah but even or even if</u>
<u n="1166" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1167" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you're looking at a British producer</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0262">and an American producer directors would be interested in it because for them it could be quite political</u>
<u n="1170" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1171" who="S0262">you know so directors have like a totally different er cap on their head but producers are the ones who are going to go out there and search for the director and for the money</u>
<u n="1172" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1173" who="S0262">so unless you get to a very famous director first who can then go to the producer but the chances are you'll be dealing with producers first</u>
<u n="1174" who="S0372">I mean we we've had a sort of <trunc>s</trunc>skip through the internet looking for actors and actresses to <pause dur="short"/> er that would be interested in taking taking the roles in this and I think the the lead role the heroine has got to be Sienna <trunc>Mill</trunc> Sienna Miller</u>
<u n="1175" who="S0262">right okay yeah she's very smart yeah</u>
<u n="1176" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0262">yeah she's very smart yeah yeah she's</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0372" trans="overlap">attractive smart could be</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0262" trans="overlap">she's attractive yeah</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0372" trans="overlap">erm</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0372">she would fit that</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0372" trans="overlap">down to the <pause dur="short"/> down to er yeah</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0262">yeah she'd</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0372" trans="overlap">made <trunc>t</trunc> made to measure for it</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0262">yeah yeah well this is also that's what helps is that you can you know you can put that down as your kind of you know your wish list of people</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0372" trans="overlap">and erm what's his name? Wambaugh</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0262">who sorry?</u>
<u n="1190" who="S0372">Steve Wambaugh? he was a in the oh I've bloody <trunc>f</trunc> it's got him and his sister <pause dur="short"/> both actors or both actors erm <pause dur="short"/> they were in one of the Batman films and they did er a couple of other films</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0262">one of the Batman films?</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0372">W A M B A U G H</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0262">okay yeah I can't picture his face right now <pause dur="short"/> yeah so you want you're as the lead</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0372">as well he was <trunc>goo</trunc> I'm thinking</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0372">taking him as the as as the detective</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0372">erm he's a bit young erm <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> found another guy I can't remember his name now Craig something or other but er <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0262">well that certainly helps</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0262">I think that certainly helps</u>
<u n="1202" who="S0372" trans="overlap">well I mean who do we pitch to? that's my problem and I've got no</u>
<u n="1203" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you have to pitch to producers</u>
<u n="1204" who="S0372">no contacts at all</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0372">I mean I don't know any</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0262">well okay let me explain to you what I understand and you see how it fits in if there's a square <trunc>p</trunc> if there's you know as a peg fits into a a circle or whatever a square peg if it well whatever the expression is but anyway you see if you can take something from it and erm</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0372" trans="overlap">do you want another coffee?</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0262">yeah that would be great thanks so what generally happens is is that you get to <pause dur="short"/> a producer through contacts erm they will either listen to you from the start or they will just say <pause dur="short"/> pass the inexperienced producers who wannabe wannabes will take everything and they will just sit on it and not do anything because they have got no influence in the film industry but the professional ones with either go thanks but no thanks it's not my bag or I'm already up to my eyebrows in projects</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0262">or some are hunting they are already looking so you are obviously trying to find the ones who are hunting</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0262">and then what you do is you basically get a whole erm bunch of <pause dur="short"/> now this is the the hard part you get because you know that money is very difficult to get to make films</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0262">unless you're in the Hollywood system <pause dur="short"/> and we're not so erm though it can sometimes end up there but if you are in Europe you're mainly looking to source money from lots of different countries so you know that Ireland has Shannon as a tax break they offer tax breaks to filmmakers Wales had tax breaks</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0262">for filmmakers there's all whole host of reasons why certain producers will put their hands up and say I'm Swedish you're British you're German <pause dur="short"/> and then somebody over there and we'll get together as a little kind of you know pot of er producers and then we'll try and get the money from our respective countries that's the co production route</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0262">so <trunc>yo</trunc> it's almost unlikely for a film of this magnitude that you'd find one producer who could get even if he's the top producer in the world</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0262">I mean in Europe he'll never get that amount of money from one country the UK just doesn't have enough money</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0372" trans="overlap">well the beauty of this is</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0262">put aside</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0372" trans="overlap">that it can be such a simple film to make</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0372">because it's all office bound there's no big action scenes</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0372" trans="overlap">where you've gotta</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0372" trans="overlap">spend many a bucks on blowing cities off the</u>
<u n="1231" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1232" who="S0372">map</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0372" trans="overlap">I mean the explosion in London can literally be glasses rattling on a table in a bunker</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0372">two hundred metres underground</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0262">that's true and that could be very suspense you know there's a lot of suspense in that</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0372" trans="overlap">and they can watch it</u>
<u n="1239" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1240" who="S0372" trans="overlap">on television</u>
<u n="1241" who="S0262">yeah it's <trunc>goo</trunc></u>
<u n="1242" who="S0372" trans="overlap">the aftermath</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0372" trans="overlap">is just this big fireball</u>
<u n="1245" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1246" who="S0372">erm</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0262">yeah so it's</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0262">it's a thriller in that sense</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah and if</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1252" who="S0372" trans="overlap">you then sort of wanna turn around and say okay we're gonna pan the camera over the ruins okay you get some fucking footage of a Russia or a</u>
<u n="1253" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1254" who="S0372">er whatever and</u>
<u n="1255" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1256" who="S0372">tart it up with</u>
<u n="1257" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0372">Photoshop or whatever you're gonna do</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well you see that's the bit the treatment is really helpful because what you've just told me I didn't know <pause dur="short"/> so that's good because I don't know what you can envisage</u>
<u n="1260" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1261" who="S0262">about this film cos I might see it differently</u>
<u n="1262" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1263" who="S0262">cos I would might have thought oh crikey it's gonna be lots of money yeah it's gonna be this and that and the other but your treatment could explain that it could say this is not a high budget film this can be done</u>
<u n="1264" who="S0372" trans="overlap">it doesn't need to be</u>
<u n="1265" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it</u>
<u n="1266" who="S0372" trans="overlap">it can be</u>
<u n="1267" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1268" who="S0372">you know you can go the whole</u>

<u n="1271" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you you know what you can see is like most producers would go what genre is this? thrillers they know that sometimes it can be high budget</u>
<u n="1272" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1273" who="S0262" trans="overlap">but I mean they also know it can be quite low budget <pause dur="short"/> the suspense that comes from</u>
<u n="1274" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1275" who="S0262" trans="overlap">thrillers I mean I love you know or I'm the kind of person who can is easily sit and watch erm you know Blunt and what's and all of that spy stuff</u>

<u n="1277" who="S0262">and you know I</u>
<u n="1278" who="S0372" trans="overlap">well my favourite film of all time is the original BBC version or did I say film? series Smiley's People</u>

<u n="1293" who="S0262">I'll have to see that erm but er Smiley's People and so we know that thrillers can be done in in that kind of more keyed down kind of <trunc>fina</trunc> you know the <trunc>bu</trunc> the budget can be keyed down and that's why the treatment would be useful</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0372" trans="overlap">I mean action the action's in the dialogue the action's in the interaction between the players</u>

<u n="1577" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1578" who="S0262" trans="overlap">exactly and it'll do everything for you</u>
<u n="1579" who="S0372" trans="overlap">he says she says</u>
<u n="1580" who="S0262">that's <trunc>r</trunc> it</u>
<u n="1581" who="S0372" trans="overlap">she said he said</u>
<u n="1582" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's right and all you have to do is then go over it and make it into what you think is the visuals you know</u>
<u n="1583" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1584" who="S0262">because dialogue is still visual cos there's all the idea about your facial gestures everything is still in in that you know</u>
<u n="1585" who="S0372">yeah I mean it's it's I mean it's basically how I wrote the book <pause dur="short"/> erm is to go through and say well you know you've got a column here events</u>
<u n="1586" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1587" who="S0372">you've got a column here describing what's going on</u>
<u n="1588" who="S0262">uhu uhu</u>
<u n="1589" who="S0372">and then you've got a column here erm <pause dur="short"/> albeit a mental column of the environment and what's happening in the environment</u>
<u n="1590" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1591" who="S0372" trans="overlap">er <pause dur="short"/> I might have overdone it with adverbs saying you know he said it sarcastically or whatever erm <pause dur="short"/> tiredly or</u>
<u n="1592" who="S0262">yes</u>
<u n="1593" who="S0372">these kind of things but they're the expressions that you've tagged on to the sentence to give the impression because it doesn't always come over in the dialogue</u>
<u n="1594" who="S0262">yes that's and that's the key to erm a professional scriptwriter I</u>
<u n="1595" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1596" who="S0262" trans="overlap">meaning as someone who's got</u>
<u n="1597" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1598" who="S0262" trans="overlap">gone through those experiences is that adverbs come up less and less and what you're seeing is somebody who's describing the facial gestures so there will be you know when someone's tired you would rather put in that kind of squint of the eye</u>
<u n="1599" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1600" who="S0262">the flick of the lid the tension in the jaw you know what you're describing is what you see when people are tired</u>
<u n="1601" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1602" who="S0262">but you're not using adverbs like</u>
<u n="1603" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1604" who="S0262" trans="overlap">tired and or yeah so but anyway that's a just a small thing the the point is is that you could buy this software application <pause dur="short"/> get it in there from the book once the book's</u>
<u n="1605" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1606" who="S0262">how you want it get it in there erm and then what you do is you start well I would advise that you write the treatment first because you write the script to your treatment</u>
<u n="1607" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1608" who="S0262">rather than the other way round</u>
<u n="1609" who="S0372">yeah sure</u>
<u n="1610" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah? erm mainly because the treatment is the is the <trunc>f</trunc> is the skeleton of the story and then what you are doing is you are basically using the you're using your dialogue and when you look at a script I don't know if you've read a script before for a film script but mainly it goes character at the top and then er what they say character then what they say and it goes</u>
<u n="1611" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1612" who="S0262" trans="overlap">like this for most of the page about less than a third of that page of an A4 page is description</u>
<u n="1613" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1614" who="S0262">and it's something like internal external day night</u>
<u n="1615" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1616" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it's quite basic <vocal desc="laugh"/> and then it's something like something about the face so you're not describing the erm er the the well you can sometimes you might wanna describe the clock on the wall or something but most of the time directors are going to fill that bit in</u>
<u n="1617" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1618" who="S0262">if they wanna cut to that clock back to you they'll do it and</u>
<u n="1619" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1620" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's their</u>
<u n="1621" who="S0372" trans="overlap">that's their bit</u>
<u n="1622" who="S0262">that's their bit</u>
<u n="1623" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1624" who="S0262">but what you're trying to to I think is place the emphasis on the characters because the director until he's read that script a number of times doesn't know the characters as well as the scriptwriter because the scriptwriter knows the back story</u>
<u n="1625" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1626" who="S0262">knows is has internalised the character</u>
<u n="1627" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1628" who="S0262">stories</u>
<u n="1629" who="S0372">I think that's the difficulty in in getting the back story into the character because you don't have a lot of time especially in films to put the back story in there</u>
<u n="1630" who="S0262">which is why the character arc and I think that</u>
<u n="1631" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1632" who="S0262" trans="overlap">might be what those people were talking about is so very useful for you if you can stick to that to begin with erm you can break some rules later</u>
<u n="1633" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1634" who="S0262">but the point is is that if somebody wants to know erm is this guy for real has he got a professional script for me to read he'll he or she the producer will look okay can they do their sums? does two and two equal four? give me the character arc without that character arc they might not believe that you've actually got the rest of it right</u>
<u n="1635" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1636" who="S0262">so it's kind of like a tick to see if you can get into the next kind of you know</u>
<u n="1637" who="S0372">into the next box</u>
<u n="1638" who="S0262" trans="overlap">the level the next box</u>
<u n="1639" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1640" who="S0262">yeah so character arcs are very useful and then you can break the <pause dur="short"/> that's the point you know once you've learnt how to do it properly you can then break it so I don't know if you have much familiarity with character arcs but I can certainly show you some <pause dur="short"/> what's really great is if you study some of the films that you love <pause dur="short"/> and then you try to break them down yourself you analyse</u>
<u n="1641" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1642" who="S0262">them so like most plays you have in film anyway you have three major scenes er acts sorry</u>
<u n="1643" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1644" who="S0262">erm sorry I'm getting a bit tired so you have three major acts and the character arc <pause dur="short"/> can I have a piece of paper?</u>
<u n="1645" who="S0372">sure</u>
<u n="1646" who="S0262" trans="overlap">just to yeah</u>
<u n="1647" who="S0372">sure sure sure</u>
<u n="1648" who="S0262" trans="overlap">I'm sure this won't be anything new to you but erm</u>
<u n="1649" who="S0372" trans="overlap">well it <trunc>prob</trunc></u>
<u n="1650" who="S0262" trans="overlap">just for the</u>
<u n="1651" who="S0372" trans="overlap">it probably will cos erm</u>
<u n="1652" who="S0262" trans="overlap">just for visuals sake it's it's</u>
<u n="1653" who="S0372"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="1654" who="S0262" trans="overlap">useful to look at something isn't it? erm so you'll have your three your three acts let's just see we'll mark them down like that because the second act tends to be a bit longer erm mainly because you can use montage at the beginning you can use lots of montage to cut to your story to start very quickly and then you know an ending can appear like in a flash like what? it just ended? that's it so this bit is the bit that normally takes for ages is the second act and this is where people tend to <pause dur="short"/>  this last bit here lots of filmmakers get this bit wrong <pause dur="short"/> I'll tell you I'll tell you why is because it's difficult to do <vocal desc="laugh"/> so anyway the character arc <pause dur="short"/> will normally be your arc so it will be <pause dur="short"/> and this is <pause dur="short"/> their own personal trajectory <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> here let's just say this isn't anything to do with erm <pause dur="short"/> happiness or <pause dur="short"/> it's nothing to do with emotion it's just basically trying to show that you need to have them do something quite amazing you know something needs to happen to them that really is obvious to an audience and that's why I think they use an arc is to show something quite big has changed</u>
<u n="1655" who="S0372" trans="overlap">well I tried that with my initial character</u>
<u n="1656" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1657" who="S0372">to do two amazing things that happen to him</u>
<u n="1658" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yes okay so plot those for me what what what are those two things?</u>
<u n="1659" who="S0372">the two things are one</u>
<u n="1660" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you can plot them somewhere</u>
<u n="1661" who="S0372">he is starting off erm <pause dur="short"/> having a brainwave</u>
<u n="1662" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1663" who="S0372">and calling his guys in on a Sunday and saying listen I've just had this breakthrough idea</u>
<u n="1664" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1665" who="S0372">and we're gonna do this that and the other</u>
<u n="1666" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1667" who="S0372">and they're all going oh fuck off cos you know it's a Sunday and</u>
<u n="1668" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="1670" who="S0262" trans="overlap">we're we're not gonna bother yeah</u>
<u n="1671" who="S0372">and er one of them said no this is what we what we need is some clever bastard who does something like the laundry thing in Northern Ireland</u>
<u n="1672" who="S0262">right okay yeah</u>
<u n="1673" who="S0372">and this the hero's sidekick turns round and says er shut your face</u>
<u n="1674" who="S0262">right</u>

<u n="1676" who="S0262">right okay yeah</u>
<u n="1677" who="S0372">and he said the laundry thing where they went round with a laundry boat collecting the washing from the houses and testing it for gunpowder and</u>

<u n="1680" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's the laundry thing right yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1681" who="S0372">and then went back and arrested a terrorist and the terrorists all thought they were being informed by their own people</u>
<u n="1682" who="S0262">yeah okay</u>
<u n="1683" who="S0372">that's it I didn't know he said well it's not exactly something that they publish in the newspapers</u>

<u n="1690" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="1691" who="S0372">the second thing is that he's lost his wife in a car bomb</u>
<u n="1692" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="1693" who="S0372">and he doesn't know who did it it could have been a police job</u>
<u n="1694" who="S0262">which happened first? the laundry thing is an inciting thing and the erm inciting</u>
<u n="1695" who="S0372" trans="overlap">and the</u>
<u n="1696" who="S0262" trans="overlap">incident</u>
<u n="1697" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1698" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and the car bomb</u>
<u n="1699" who="S0372">the car bomb is the same night you learned about the car bomb but it was in the past</u>
<u n="1700" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1701" who="S0372">and because he gets reminded about his wife</u>

<u n="1705" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1706" who="S0262">because you see him unravel or you</u>
<u n="1707" who="S0372" trans="overlap">well you see</u>
<u n="1708" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you see</u>
<u n="1709" who="S0372" trans="overlap">no you see it first of all in his very very <pause dur="short"/> constructive very driven role being totally innovative as a detective</u>
<u n="1710" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1711" who="S0372">and then he goes out and he thinks well because I've done this er what he's doing he's examining PAYE records</u>
<u n="1712" who="S0262">yes</u>
<u n="1713" who="S0372">er in the town</u>
<u n="1714" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="1716" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1717" who="S0372">and saying well we're gonna look at anything that looks slightly tinted</u>
<u n="1718" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="1719" who="S0372" trans="overlap">that's got a new <trunc>PA</trunc> we er a PAYE account</u>
<u n="1720" who="S0262">okay</u>

<u n="1722" who="S0262">okay right</u>

<u n="1724" who="S0262">okay okay</u>
<u n="1725" who="S0372">so that's his laundry scam is the PAYE thing</u>
<u n="1726" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="1727" who="S0372">but he said on top of that he said I'm going to go out he said while you lot get your heads round who's gonna knock on which door and which teams you're gonna do it he says I'm gonna go and talk to a couple of guys who let out cheap accommodation to tinted folk</u>
<u n="1728" who="S0262">right</u>

<u n="1733" who="S0372">erm and they just happen to frequent my local boozer or one of my local boozers</u>
<u n="1734" who="S0262">right and then the drinking binge?</u>
<u n="1735" who="S0372">and then the drinking binge and he gets given from the landlord who's a great mate of his he gets given a erm a CD of a bootleg Led Zeppelin concert</u>
<u n="1736" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="1737" who="S0372">that he goes back and listens to and he has a brandy too many</u>
<u n="1738" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1739" who="S0372">and the next</u>
<u n="1740" who="S0262" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="1741" who="S0372">and in that night this virus institute gets broken into</u>
<u n="1742" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="1743" who="S0372">so he's totally hungover the next morning and he's up on the phone and Samantha says boss you'd better get in here</u>
<u n="1744" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1745" who="S0372">chief superintendent's just given you two fingers</u>
<u n="1746" who="S0262">yeah okay</u>
<u n="1747" who="S0372">which what the fuck I don't like that guy anyway</u>
<u n="1748" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1749" who="S0372">erm</u>
<u n="1750" who="S0262" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="1751" who="S0372">so that's the kick off</u>
<u n="1752" who="S0262">alright so so what you would do then is you would decide</u>
<u n="1753" who="S0372" trans="overlap">but it's not only trying to present this guy as a clever bollocks</u>
<u n="1754" who="S0262">no</u>
<u n="1755" who="S0372">but also as a</u>
<u n="1756" who="S0262" trans="overlap">he's got problems</u>
<u n="1757" who="S0372" trans="overlap">flawed human</u>
<u n="1758" who="S0262">oh yeah he's got issues as well yeah that's right so you've got the cause and effect it seems like you accelerate erm from let's say quite a normal situation</u>
<u n="1759" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1760" who="S0262">at the beginning I think the hunch is where it starts to</u>
<u n="1761" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1762" who="S0262" trans="overlap">kick in and this is actually what propels him to start</u>
<u n="1763" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1764" who="S0262">and then you would mark out for example you know it's quite easy to do if you think about film being as being let's say a hundred and twenty minutes these days because a page of A4 script that's formatted</u>
<u n="1765" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1766" who="S0262">is about a minute <pause dur="short"/> of film time</u>
<u n="1767" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1768" who="S0262">it's a rule of thumb <pause dur="short"/> but it does help you to understand that anything longer than a hundred and twenty pages for a script you'd need to have a good reason why it's longer you you know like you're doing a Tolkien or you know you're bloody well you know</u>
<u n="1769" who="S0372"><vocal desc="cough"/> well I must I must admit I found the treatment of the Tolkien films the Lords of the Rings</u>
<u n="1770" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1771" who="S0372">I found it totally boring</u>
<u n="1772" who="S0262">yeah well treatments are quite boring</u>
<u n="1773" who="S0372">I mean it lasts for no I mean the film itself I find</u>
<u n="1774" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1775" who="S0372" trans="overlap">the action</u>

<u n="1783" who="S0372">and it think hang on this is a film for morons</u>
<u n="1784" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>

<u n="1788" who="S0262">no I completely agree with you I completely agree with you but what can happen is that erm what you wanna do so you normally have what is in it? so you've got time here and you've got act there okay? or if you wanted to do you can do time here which I'll guess is a bit normal and then here you can have the escalation of and you have to choose if you want to use the character arc about this man <pause dur="short"/> as a as the protagonist then you have to choose what really is the kernel of this person? what is the erm the reason why he keeps moving along this trajectory? what's the common sense of why he's going here?</u>
<u n="1789" who="S0372">justice justice justice justice</u>
<u n="1790" who="S0262" trans="overlap">so the search for truth yeah</u>

<u n="1885" who="S0372">might have erm tangentially touched some of his superiors er he's</u>
<u n="1886" who="S0262">ah okay</u>

<u n="1890" who="S0262">yes</u>

<u n="1894" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="1895" who="S0372">and the car blew up</u>
<u n="1896" who="S0262">right okay</u>
<u n="1897" who="S0372" trans="overlap">and it was aimed at him</u>
<u n="1898" who="S0262">okay so there <trunc>i</trunc> there is in a way erm</u>
<u n="1899" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yes it's dinner time I know</u>
<u n="1900" who="S0262">so all of these things what you've just mentioned</u>
<u n="1901" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1902" who="S0262">there I can already see that there's you know there's quite a lot of erm strands to his let's say to his <pause dur="short"/> backdrop and his story his motivations his erm inner kind of conflict that's going on</u>
<u n="1903" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1904" who="S0262">but to make it easy for a producer to understand you have to choose one <pause dur="short"/>  and you have to make sure that that comes through in the treatment the director will pick up with the actors</u>
<u n="1905" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1906" who="S0262">and they will explore all of the things that you're talking about of course cos that's the stuff people wanna see on screen</u>
<u n="1907" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1908" who="S0262">you know they wanna see all this difficult stuff that people have to go through but for the producer they're not creative like that they just need one main trajectory that they can say this guy knows that this is the most propelling one that is going to make it believable</u>
<u n="1909" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1910" who="S0262">for an audience so that's the type of thing that you know I would say</u>
<u n="1911" who="S0372" trans="overlap">do you do the twin one? do you do the hero and the heroine?</u>
<u n="1912" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah you would plot both</u>
<u n="1913" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1914" who="S0262">you'd <trunc>p</trunc> have you'd have your protagonist your</u>
<u n="1915" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1916" who="S0262" trans="overlap">antagonist hero heroine and sometimes what you'll find is that you have something inverse arc so you might start up over here and it's going down like that you know and so</u>
<u n="1917" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1918" who="S0262" trans="overlap">some people might say okay that means that something negative is happening and then it picks up I don't really care which way you look at it</u>
<u n="1919" who="S0372">uhu</u>
<u n="1920" who="S0262">the point is that it needs to <trunc>ha</trunc> show a range of movement you know</u>
<u n="1921" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1922" who="S0262">it needs to show that kind of arc and it's nice if you can plot it out say you know if you break it down and your favourite film just any film and go okay <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I think the first act finished about here and I wanna know what happened there I wanna know that</u>
<u n="1923" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1924" who="S0262">plotted normally there's a jump here and this is the bit where things get hard cos normally around about here you need to start erm getting your denouement or the denouement</u>
<u n="1925" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1926" who="S0262">you know the brown here <pause dur="short"/> you need to start erm scaffolding it so that people believe the ending <pause dur="short"/> and what people tend to do is because audiences tend to be a bit thick <pause dur="short"/> they don't mm understand this bit they don't understand what that is meant what what it is they're not film literate enough to</u>
<u n="1927" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1928" who="S0262" trans="overlap">get that bit so what they do is that they start having to I suppose</u>
<u n="1929" who="S0372">recap</u>
<u n="1930" who="S0262">recap or make it slower <vocal desc="laugh"/> or try to explain it which is the wrong thing to do in my view</u>
<u n="1931" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1932" who="S0262">but because audiences don't understand it they need an explanation but as soon as you start trying to explain something to audiences either</u>
<u n="1933" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="1934" who="S0262">they fall into I'm actually I'm quite intelligent and I don't need</u>
<u n="1935" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1936" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it explained to me or I'm still too thick to understand this <pause dur="short"/> cos this film just is perhaps a little bit beyond me</u>
<u n="1937" who="S0372">well it's like a joke if you've to explain it it's no good</u>
<u n="1938" who="S0262">right exactly</u>
<u n="1939" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="1940" who="S0262">thank you that's</u>
<u n="1941" who="S0372" trans="overlap">but</u>
<u n="1942" who="S0262" trans="overlap">exactly it <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's</u>
<u n="1943" who="S0372" trans="overlap">the erm</u>
<u n="1944" who="S0262">don't explain it yeah <pause dur="short"/> so the trick is here really</u>
<u n="1945" who="S0372">the plotline</u>
<u n="1946" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1947" who="S0372">runs in two parallel threads the virus and the <pause dur="short"/> al-Qaeda plot</u>
<u n="1948" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1949" who="S0372">the virus thing almost comes to an end you think oh they've solved that problem the animal rights nutters have all been <pause dur="short"/> bumped it or locked away</u>
<u n="1950" who="S0262" trans="overlap">uhu uhu</u>
<u n="1951" who="S0372">erm and then they discover that the virus is still a threat because it's got out of the labs through this raid</u>
<u n="1952" who="S0262" trans="overlap">uhu uhu</u>
<u n="1953" who="S0372" trans="overlap">it's had an antigenic shift and it's</u>
<u n="1954" who="S0262" trans="overlap">uhu</u>
<u n="1955" who="S0372" trans="overlap">developed into something that's quite nasty</u>
<u n="1956" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1957" who="S0372">but it only affects darkies</u>
<u n="1958" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1959" who="S0372" trans="overlap">or</u>
<u n="1960" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1961" who="S0372" trans="overlap">over exposed people</u>
<u n="1962" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1963" who="S0372">erm <pause dur="short"/> and er the bomb plot they finally get a handle on twenty minutes before the bomb goes on</u>
<u n="1964" who="S0262">uhu okay so that's when the it's this is when the countdown <trunc>star</trunc> you know of the clock</u>
<u n="1965" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1966" who="S0262" trans="overlap">starts ticking?</u>

<u n="1968" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1969" who="S0372" trans="overlap">ticking all the way</u>
<u n="1970" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah but this is when the audience feel an uplift of</u>

<u n="2033" who="S0372"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2034" who="S0262">but normally the denouement as well is when somebody is about to you're you're gonna get that <trunc>comeup</trunc>uppance you have a sense of it's almost like you're going to trick the audience you're gonna go yeah that guy is gonna get his comeuppance and then you actually are showing that no it's not that one it's this one</u>
<u n="2035" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2036" who="S0262">yeah so there's that sense of</u>
<u n="2037" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2038" who="S0262">maybe in a way the heightened bit is is the bomb</u>
<u n="2039" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2040" who="S0262">it's about here I'm just pulling it back</u>
<u n="2041" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2042" who="S0262">a bit and then the rest of it plays out as</u>
<u n="2043" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2044" who="S0262">you explained you know but I think this is where we we see erm there's a change of gear and the audience are meant to engage brain at this stage</u>
<u n="2045" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2046" who="S0262">to start trying to guess who's the bad guy who's the real bad guy who's really to blame</u>
<u n="2047" who="S0372">well they know that all along they know who the real bad guy is</u>
<u n="2048" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="2049" who="S0372">but they don't know how he's gonna get caught</u>
<u n="2050" who="S0262">right okay so where do you present that part? which part of it for you is they know the audience knows is it in the first act?</u>

<u n="2052" who="S0262">who it is?</u>
<u n="2053" who="S0372">who the bad guy is</u>
<u n="2054" who="S0262">okay <pause dur="short"/> so you've gotta clock that point</u>
<u n="2055" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2056" who="S0262">as that's the bad guy and people knowing</u>
<u n="2057" who="S0372">the villain</u>

<u n="2072" who="S0262" trans="overlap">their cars are set on a trajectory</u>
<u n="2073" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2074" who="S0262">you know what the game is</u>
<u n="2075" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2076" who="S0262">it's gonna be chicken it's either you know yeah you're gonna miss each other</u>
<u n="2077" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2078" who="S0262">and someone's gonna get away the villain's gonna get away or <pause dur="short"/> the other one's gonna get it or they're both gonna get it</u>
<u n="2079" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2080" who="S0262">or both of them put the brakes on because they just don't wanna die you know I guess it's that win lose</u>
<u n="2081" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2082" who="S0262">you know prisoner game or whatever it is</u>
<u n="2083" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2084" who="S0262">so yeah that that also goes into the treatment so in a way erm the <trunc>trea</trunc> I'll show it I'll show you one but if you can start to at least in your own mind start to have a very I think you have got a very clear sense of the plot now what you're doing is you're visually showing someone something different</u>
<u n="2085" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2086" who="S0262">you're actually showing somebody this character arc or characters</u>
<u n="2087" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2088" who="S0262" trans="overlap">because you'll have both erm</u>
<event desc="sound of dog"/>
<u n="2089" who="S0372">oh no you're hungry aren't you? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2090" who="S0262">and you can always know if you've put too much information in because you can say break it down into a two hour film <pause dur="short"/> here is one hour and here is two break it again into thirty minutes</u>
<u n="2091" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2092" who="S0262">here again let's say</u>
<u n="2093" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2094" who="S0262">thirty minutes</u>
<u n="2095" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2096" who="S0262">so you can kind of know if you're over writing on one bit</u>
<u n="2097" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2098" who="S0262">you can say this is my thirty pages this is really good to get you started what even just thinking about time <pause dur="short"/> cos that's so different from people reading a book they can take as much time as they want</u>
<u n="2099" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2100" who="S0262">to read that book but as soon as you're in the cinema this is how long this film is you're gonna sit down and watch the whole bloody thing yeah? that's how it goes and people are paying their money for that so in your first thirty pages let's say you've got a first thirty minutes of the film I've marked it there</u>
<u n="2101" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2102" who="S0262">each minute something bloody interesting is happening but you know that this is the most interesting minute</u>
<u n="2103" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2104" who="S0262">and that's the next interesting minute and these are the points you mark in your treatment in your script of course you have to write all the <unclear/></u>
<u n="2105" who="S0372" trans="overlap">but thing is that erm in this character arc of the hero</u>
<u n="2106" who="S0262" trans="overlap">uhu</u>
<u n="2107" who="S0372" trans="overlap">for example erm finding out about the bad guy happens in America</u>
<u n="2108" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="2109" who="S0372">one of their drones picks him up cos he's using a bloody sim card</u>
<u n="2110" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="2111" who="S0372">in the Pakistani mountains</u>
<u n="2112" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="2113" who="S0372">erm</u>
<u n="2114" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's that's fine yeah</u>
<u n="2115" who="S0372" trans="overlap">he gets it beamed back to him as an email</u>
<u n="2116" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="2117" who="S0372">and they turn round and say well we've just done facial recognition on this guy</u>
<u n="2118" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="2119" who="S0372">er the CIA's computers have come up and said he's so and so</u>
<u n="2120" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2121" who="S0372">last seen at the Nairobi bombings</u>
<u n="2122" who="S0262">right okay</u>
<u n="2123" who="S0372" trans="overlap">and then aha</u>
<u n="2124" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah alright</u>
<u n="2125" who="S0372" trans="overlap">nice we'll put him on the on the</u>
<u n="2126" who="S0262" trans="overlap"><trunc>ye</trunc></u>
<u n="2127" who="S0372" trans="overlap">on the white board</u>
<u n="2128" who="S0262">yes yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2129" who="S0372" trans="overlap">er the other guy we can't identify the picture wasn't clear enough</u>
<u n="2130" who="S0262">right okay</u>
<u n="2131" who="S0372" trans="overlap">erm <pause dur="short"/> so they've now got a handle on it but they don't know at the moment who the main guy is in Britain</u>
<u n="2132" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="2133" who="S0372">he comes to light through a prostitutes' ring</u>
<u n="2134" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="2135" who="S0372">which was running through the job centre</u>
<u n="2136" who="S0262">right okay yeah no on this this is all great and this is all makes sense because what you're what you're telling me in a way is cause and effect seems like the way you talk about things is this is gonna be leading to this and then that we'll have that</u>
<u n="2137" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2138" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and it's all a knock on</u>
<u n="2139" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2140" who="S0262">it's all a knock on so this is the sort of plot detail</u>
<u n="2141" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2142" who="S0262">and then I think what you need to do is just as I say you need to like pick out those most important <pause dur="short"/> I guess it's the most important bits of information if you had to say look <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I'm gonna give you erm the character not the storyline but the storyline but the character's arc in about two minutes I'll tell you this point this point this point this point and I'm done</u>
<u n="2143" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2144" who="S0262">that's what a treatment is a treatment deals with brevity</u>
<u n="2145" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2146" who="S0262">and it is succinct I mean it but it means the same thing but you know what I mean so these things are quite hard to pull out particularly when you have written a book you've in the process of rewriting your book you're thinking about writing a film script from it you know these characters so well that sometimes it's very hard to choose which part is the most important</u>
<u n="2147" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2148" who="S0262" trans="overlap">part so that's why somebody like myself could when you're if you wanna go ahead with it could start to actually go okay you've given me shitloads of detail but the bit that I think if you agree</u>
<u n="2149" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2150" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and you discuss it with me let's put this in as the most important thing let's then move on to this bit but that takes a little bit of discussion from the scriptwriter</u>
<u n="2151" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2152" who="S0262">what is the most important thing for this thirty minutes? what's the next thirty minutes and the next thirty minutes and the next thirty minutes?</u>
<u n="2153" who="S0372">but there may be two important things happen in the first thirty minutes</u>
<u n="2154" who="S0262">yeah yeah and that's when you have to say I can argue at the beginning there's something that's important</u>
<u n="2155" who="S0372">well there's two things driving this guy one is</u>
<u n="2156" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2157" who="S0372" trans="overlap">the loss of his wife and the other one's his sense of justice</u>
<u n="2158" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2159" who="S0372">there's two things happening along this line the virus and the bomb threat</u>
<u n="2160" who="S0262">yeah yeah which is your plotline <trunc>w</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="2161" who="S0372" trans="overlap">which is your plotline</u>
<u n="2162" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2163" who="S0372">erm there are two characters involved</u>
<u n="2164" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2165" who="S0372">driven a lot of this plotline through totally different directions</u>
<u n="2166" who="S0262">yes yeah so you might have</u>
<u n="2167" who="S0372" trans="overlap">a civilian and a <trunc>pol</trunc> and a policeman</u>
<u n="2168" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="2169" who="S0372">erm <pause dur="short"/> and erm you've also got this thing about field craft spy craft</u>
<u n="2170" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2171" who="S0372">erm <pause dur="short"/> underground agents or whatever you like to call these things</u>
<u n="2172" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="2175" who="S0372">erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah I have I have a problem structuring that</u>
<u n="2176" who="S0262">mm mm it is not easy to do when you know the story inside and out</u>
<u n="2177" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2178" who="S0262">and you know the characters <pause dur="short"/> it's extracting teeth really it's</u>

<u n="2190" who="S0262" trans="overlap">position to to do that but I would certainly say I can show you a treatment sometimes the treatment can help if you've seen the film and you know the film really well</u>
<u n="2191" who="S0372">I mean the problem I have <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I've seen a decent film in about two years</u>

<u n="2375" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2376" who="S0262">somewhere and they said right we'll quickly make a film we don't really care if it's shit let's just spend it cos sometimes</u>
<u n="2377" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2378" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's what they do</u>
<u n="2379" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2380" who="S0262">and that's why a lot</u>
<u n="2381" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah I think that was it</u>
<u n="2382" who="S0262" trans="overlap">of pants films anyway I've got to go</u>
<u n="2383" who="S0372">alright</u>
<u n="2384" who="S0262">but what we can do is we can work on this</u>
<u n="2385" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2386" who="S0262" trans="overlap">when you when you want to I mean I'm quite I'm quite intrigued about all of this now you've got me really hooked in about you know of course the plot but I'm really interested in the character formation the arc you know I think it <pause dur="short"/> it could be a really interesting process</u>
<u n="2387" who="S0372" trans="overlap">yeah I mean if you can send me if you can send me an example of a treatment</u>
<u n="2388" who="S0262">yeah yeah okay yeah</u>
<u n="2389" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mail it to me</u>
<u n="2390" who="S0262">yeah yeah yeah I will <pause dur="short"/> I'll definitely send you it er one thing I wanna just say when I</u>
<u n="2391" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2392" who="S0262">send you the treatment <pause dur="short"/> don't be put off by it <pause dur="short"/> what I mean by that is if I send you a treatment well okay well let me say <pause dur="short"/> a treatment's a really bloody hard thing to write cos it's normally only about three or four pages long</u>
<u n="2393" who="S0372">yeah but it's a <trunc>struc</trunc> it's the structure</u>
<u n="2394" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it's the structure</u>
<u n="2395" who="S0372" trans="overlap">I'm looking at</u>
<u n="2396" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah but you might look at it and go how the hell am I meant to condense my whole entire film into three or four pages? and how you do it is by going through this type of process</u>
<u n="2397" who="S0372" trans="overlap">uhu</u>
<u n="2398" who="S0262">that's how you break it down and that's why each paragraph is here you know the paragraphs are dotted along these trajectories paragraphs are not actually plotlines er plot points</u>
<u n="2399" who="S0372">no but</u>
<u n="2400" who="S0262" trans="overlap">in a treatment</u>
<u n="2401" who="S0372" trans="overlap">that heading is a plot</u>
<u n="2402" who="S0262">yes <pause dur="short"/> this is a different formation it's a different formation of information</u>
<u n="2403" who="S0372" trans="overlap">I mean what I find what I find difficult I mean it's sort of running the things through my head now is I've got seventy chapters</u>
<u n="2404" who="S0262">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="2405" who="S0372" trans="overlap">some of them are very short</u>
<u n="2406" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2407" who="S0372">but seventy chapters in two hours if I say there'll be two minutes a chapter</u>
<u n="2408" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2409" who="S0372">you know we're looking at</u>
<u n="2410" who="S0262">yeah it's not gonna work yeah</u>
<u n="2411" who="S0372" trans="overlap">no it's gonna be too long</u>
<u n="2412" who="S0262">yeah so that's why bits of</u>
<u n="2413" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2414" who="S0262">chapters will not appear in the film</u>
<u n="2415" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2416" who="S0262">but that's why you have to be clear in your mind and so that you can actually convince a producer</u>
<u n="2417" who="S0372">I mean this is the thing</u>
<u n="2418" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that you know this</u>
<u n="2419" who="S0372" trans="overlap">where you have to make a judgement is is</u>
<u n="2420" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2421" who="S0372">is something visually vital to capture the imagination? er or is it plot vital?</u>
<u n="2422" who="S0262">okay I know the answer to that always go visual you always because</u>
<u n="2423" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2424" who="S0262" trans="overlap">the medium of film</u>
<u n="2425" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2426" who="S0262">is visual</u>
<u n="2427" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="2428" who="S0262">and audio er audio</u>
<u n="2429" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2430" who="S0262">you always go on the visual</u>
<u n="2431" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2432" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you err on the side of visual you never go with plotline <pause dur="short"/> the <trunc>st</trunc> the the the audience if they are film literate enough will pick up what you're doing</u>
<u n="2433" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2434" who="S0262" trans="overlap">very quickly you know that <pause dur="short"/> you know that people can follow things really very quickly</u>
<u n="2435" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2436" who="S0262">why? because actually they read the way that they look at the screen is that they can pick up so much information it normally</u>
<u n="2437" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2438" who="S0262" trans="overlap">the eye goes in this kind of clockwise</u>
<u n="2439" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2440" who="S0262">so your <trunc>s</trunc> you you can actually put in one page the way that the eye works on the screen especially a bloody big screen on a cinema</u>
<u n="2441" who="S0372" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2442" who="S0262">you can put in so much information on the visual side</u>
<u n="2443" who="S0372">yeah</u>
<u n="2444" who="S0262">that people can see depth of field they can see the actor they can see periphery</u>
<u n="2445" who="S0372">mm <pause dur="short"/> they can see what's going on in the background they can see what's</u>
<u n="2446" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and you don't need to explain it</u>
<u n="2447" who="S0372">no</u>
<u n="2448" who="S0262">that's what I mean don't explain the plots</u>
<u n="2449" who="S0372">no</u>
<u n="2450" who="S0262">just put in the visual</u>
<u n="2451" who="S0372" trans="overlap">well it's a bit like writing the book itself</u>
<u n="2452" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2453" who="S0372" trans="overlap">except show it don't don't tell it</u>
<u n="2454" who="S0262">exactly yeah</u>
<u n="2455" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2456" who="S0262">and the dialogue is the force</u>
<u n="2457" who="S0372">mm</u>
<u n="2458" who="S0262">yeah that's really what keeps the momentum going with obviously some you know <pause dur="short"/> kind of interesting <trunc>thi</trunc> er things that</u>
<u n="2459" who="S0372" trans="overlap">but you know it's</u>
<u n="2460" who="S0262" trans="overlap">happen along the way</u>
<u n="2461" who="S0372">the thing's gotta be interesting the characters have gotta be interesting there's gotta be friction there there's gotta be</u>
<u n="2462" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2463" who="S0372">electricity there</u>
<u n="2464" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
