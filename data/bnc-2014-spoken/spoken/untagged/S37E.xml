<u n="302" who="S0481">because the governments or the <trunc>poli</trunc> the political class have become remote they're not representing you anymore they are autocratic arrogant and they don't seem to be able to change things at the speed that local people want them but it's not easy for local politicians and if you then suddenly say hey we have to have our own energy supply therefore you are going to have a nuclear power station next to your house Mr whatever whether you like it or not someone's gotta make those decisions</u>
<u n="303" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="304" who="S0481">at the moment it's easier to blame <pause dur="short"/> the Westminster government or somebody else like</u>

<u n="308" who="S0481" trans="overlap">well that's</u>
<u n="309" who="S0439">and it's just and but people don't seem to understand that it really annoys me that people just want what they want and don't really look at the big picture</u>
<u n="310" who="S0481">yeah they're very short termism and if they've</u>
<u n="311" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="312" who="S0481">they have to get elected that's why company owners often take longer term views and have come up with better solutions cos they've got wider options they can go to different countries</u>
<u n="313" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="314" who="S0481">they can so if they're not making enough money in America they can say well why don't we build a factory in China and build and bring it in? the they've got more flexibility than what a politician has</u>
<u n="315" who="S0439">cos that's been the problem with Obama hasn't it? it's just he hasn't been in power long enough to make the constitutional changes</u>
<u n="316" who="S0481">I don't think Obama came from a class that he had enough leverage</u>
<u n="317" who="S0439">no</u>
<u n="318" who="S0481">and <pause dur="short"/> with with the with the <unclear>ability</unclear> of class in other words there is so much er</u>
<u n="319" who="S0439"><trunc>nepo</trunc> well no not nepotism</u>
<u n="320" who="S0481" trans="overlap">well yeah nepotism bribery</u>
<u n="321" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="322" who="S0481">corruption er only doing things for your state I mean the people that held up the the health er plans simply because they were trying to screw some more out of Obama for their state who frankly just they should have been shot</u>
<u n="323" who="S0439">yeah it's not for the wider picture is it? it's for</u>
<u n="324" who="S0481">no and</u>
<u n="325" who="S0439" trans="overlap">it's for them</u>
<u n="326" who="S0481">and yet the mayor of Lille is held up as being great because he insisted that if you're gonna go through his region he wanted a station</u>
<u n="327" who="S0439">yeah but that makes a point though</u>
<u n="328" who="S0481">and it's revolutionised Lille</u>
<u n="329" who="S0439">yeah but that's a good idea though isn't it?</u>
<u n="330" who="S0481">well I dunno I I suppose to other people it it cost twenty million to put a station Lille that slowed their trip down by I dunno twenty minutes I've no idea but I'm just saying that he took a very localised view and it's revolutionised his city so all you can do is he's not elected to run France he's just elected to</u>
<u n="331" who="S0439">represent his region</u>
<u n="332" who="S0481" trans="overlap">run Lille yeah</u>
<u n="333" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="334" who="S0481">and you could say the same about democratic even America because you are <trunc>o</trunc> you are not elected by taking the wider view you are just elected for taking a very narrow view it's like</u>
<u n="335" who="S0440">the last time I came back by Eurostar we came back via Lille</u>
<u n="336" who="S0481">don't we always come back via Lille?</u>

<u n="339" who="S0440">no</u>
<u n="340" who="S0481" trans="overlap">cos Lille is north of the erm</u>
<u n="341" who="S0440">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but we came back via Lille and we came back via Ebbsfleet I'd never been to Ebbsfleet either</u>
<u n="342" who="S0439">but I don't see any problem with having a slightly longer journey to stop in places that actually people want to go to</u>
<u n="343" who="S0440">well the Lille is now is gonna to be big now because it's the it's the way you go when you wanna go to erm</u>
<u n="344" who="S0481">Brussels or those places</u>
<u n="345" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah so</u>
