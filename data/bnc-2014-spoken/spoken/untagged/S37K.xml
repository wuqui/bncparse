<u n="1499" who="S0058">I was joking <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1500" who="S0179">so it's the mountains that go up half way through <pause dur="short"/> as it were the backbone of Wales <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="1501" who="S0120">not <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="1502" who="S0179">no <pause dur="short"/> separate range</u>
<u n="1503" who="S0120">okay I don't know what that is then <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1504" who="S0058">it's like half way up <pause dur="short"/> see there's Wales it's here</u>
<u n="1505" who="S0120">I was expecting like Brecon or Snowdonia</u>
<u n="1506" who="S0179">no <pause dur="short"/> well there's a range so there's two ranges of hills in Wales <pause dur="short"/> so looking at it from your perspective this is like end of Wales <pause dur="short"/> eh this is the range Brecon Beacons sort of petering out as you get towards Pembrokeshire and then there's a second range which goes like that</u>
<u n="1507" who="S0120">mm mm</u>
<u n="1508" who="S0179">starting about here going upwards</u>
<u n="1509" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="1510" who="S0179">there's a gap</u>
<u n="1511" who="S0120">snowdonia being near the top</u>
<u n="1512" who="S0179">yeah they end in Snowdonia but they go pretty much the entire length <pause dur="short"/> so it's the sort of knee end of those <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="1513" who="S0058">but it's kind of on the coast so there's some nice views of cliffs and things</u>
<u n="1514" who="S0179">there's tonnes of nice beaches lots of nice things to do</u>
<u n="1515" who="S0120">oh so near <trunc>Ca</trunc> or in Cardigan Bay?</u>

<u n="1517" who="S0058"><trunc>Y</trunc></u>
<u n="1518" who="S0179">yeah in Cardigan Bay <pause dur="short"/> so it's half way between eh Cardigan and Aberystwyth <pause dur="short"/> erm but the point being there's a lot of things to do virtually none of which costs anything</u>
<u n="1519" who="S0058">and there's no restaurants so you don't go out you just stay in and cook</u>
<u n="1520" who="S0120">yay</u>
<u n="1521" who="S0058">yay</u>

<u n="1523" who="S0058">exactly so <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Which could be fun</u>
<u n="1524" who="S0179">so yeah who's eh leading idea? Erm other ideas up north in Scotland <pause dur="short"/> which I'm keen on</u>
<u n="1525" who="S0058"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1526" who="S0179">erm that eh question getting a train to Newcastle hiring a car at Newcastle and driving <pause dur="short"/> so it's a day ish <pause dur="short"/> pros</u>
<u n="1527" who="S0058">it's really different</u>
<u n="1528" who="S0179">it's very different <pause dur="short"/> if you've never been there before and I don't think you have and don't think anyone else would deny it</u>
<u n="1529" who="S0058">I recommend the highlands <pause dur="short"/> they're really cool</u>
<u n="1530" who="S0179">it's very exotic as in it's not like Scotland as you know it <pause dur="short"/> so there's you go through the <trunc>high</trunc> central highlands to get there <pause dur="short"/> once you get north of Inverness it's a completely different ball game <pause dur="short"/> it's wild</u>
<u n="1531" who="S0058">insane hills and white beaches and it's really cool</u>
<u n="1532" who="S0179">yeah like I said exotic is a good word <pause dur="short"/> eh again</u>
<u n="1533" who="S0120">sounds good</u>
<u n="1534" who="S0179">nice cheap cottage because it's so far it's so remote it's not expensive <pause dur="short"/> so again it will probably be at most five hundred</u>
<u n="1535" who="S0058">do you want to sit on a chair? You're allowed it's fine</u>
<u n="1536" who="S0120">I want to lie down</u>

<u n="1538" who="S0179">we're going to have cheese and biscuits later</u>
<u n="1539" who="S0120">sounds good</u>
<u n="1540" who="S0179">erm so at most</u>
<u n="1541" who="S0058" trans="overlap">so it's yeah <pause dur="short"/> so that would be good</u>
<u n="1542" who="S0179" trans="overlap">at most it would be five hundred quid</u>
<u n="1543" who="S0120">I have an outing tomorrow morning</u>
<u n="1544" who="S0058">ooh <pause dur="short"/> why?</u>
<u n="1545" who="S0120"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="1551" who="S0058">sorry <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> is really cool</u>
<u n="1552" who="S0179">erm so again there's not a lot to do that involves money which is good <pause dur="short"/> so again it's just a lot of like</u>
<u n="1553" who="S0058">beaches</u>
<u n="1554" who="S0179" trans="overlap">boozing inside erm but the problem is that you have to drive a long way to get anywhere <pause dur="short"/> so you do spend more on fuel than you would do elsewhere</u>
<u n="1555" who="S0058">yeah that's true whereas if you were in Wales</u>
<u n="1556" who="S0179">ah but that said it is proportionally a lot cheaper and you don't spend anything out</u>
<u n="1557" who="S0058">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1558" who="S0179">erm then another option is eh</u>
<u n="1559" who="S0058">Northumberland?</u>
<u n="1560" who="S0179">no <pause dur="short"/> the other one</u>
<u n="1561" who="S0058">the other one?</u>
<u n="1562" who="S0179">you've been there <pause dur="short"/> pink sofa</u>
<u n="1563" who="S0058">oh there? Yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah so it's near Carlisle</u>
<u n="1564" who="S0179">what's it's called</u>
<u n="1565" who="S0058">erm</u>
<u n="1566" who="S0179">which is near Carlisle so it's kind of other side of the country but at my parents' kind of level</u>
<u n="1567" who="S0179">but what they've got is some very</u>
<u n="1568" who="S0120">I don't know where Carlisle is</u>
<u n="1569" who="S0179">which is good because it's in a sort of striking distance of the Lakes Northumberland Dumfries and Galloway and the Pennines</u>
<u n="1570" who="S0058">it's close  it's close  to all the highlights basically</u>
<u n="1571" who="S0179">yeah it's basically a literal epicentre to get to anywhere decent <pause dur="short"/> but what they have is they have a nice cottage well they've got a couple of cottage can actually sleep six people <pause dur="short"/> incredibly luxurious sort of fifty inch TVs et cetera <pause dur="short"/> but but but</u>
<u n="1572" who="S0120">I wouldn't sit in and watch TV up there <pause dur="short"/> I can watch TV at home <pause dur="short"/> where it's flat</u>
<u n="1573" who="S0179">key thing <pause dur="short"/> private hot tubs</u>
<u n="1574" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1575" who="S0120">what one each?</u>
<u n="1576" who="S0058">that would be good yeah <pause dur="short"/> a really warm bucket <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> As in each cottage has a private hot tub</u>
<u n="1577" who="S0179">well the big cottages do</u>
<u n="1578" who="S0058">which has attractions <pause dur="short"/> but they are on more expensive so</u>
<u n="1579" who="S0179">so probably in eth summer you'd be looking at about a grand a week</u>
<u n="1580" who="S0058">which is</u>
<u n="1581" who="S0179">again not a huge amount</u>
<u n="1582" who="S0058">but it's a lot more than</u>
<u n="1583" who="S0120">it is when it's</u>
<u n="1584" who="S0058">because of the</u>
<u n="1585" who="S0120">more than five per cent of your annual salary before tax <pause dur="short"/> no after tax</u>
<u n="1586" who="S0179">yeah but you don't pay that each</u>
<u n="1587" who="S0120">oh</u>
<u n="1588" who="S0058">not a grand each</u>
<u n="1589" who="S0120">of course of course <pause dur="short"/> sorry <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> indeed</u>
<u n="1590" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1591" who="S0058">we're not suggesting this</u>
<u n="1592" who="S0179">so it's not in fact six grand a week</u>
<u n="1593" who="S0120" trans="overlap">right okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1594" who="S0179">that would be pushing it</u>
<u n="1595" who="S0058">that would be pushing it <pause dur="short"/> you can probably pay that but probably for a country house</u>
<u n="1596" who="S0179">yeah so</u>
<u n="1597" who="S0058">so yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's a bit more expensive <pause dur="short"/> you do get kind of a more luxurious cottage but I guess it's more and you're closer to</u>
<u n="1598" who="S0179">things</u>
<u n="1599" who="S0058">all the things</u>
<u n="1600" who="S0179">so you'd spend a lot less fuel <pause dur="short"/> well compared to Scotland you'd spend a lot less on fuel <pause dur="short"/> to get to Scotland you need a return train fare to Newcastle and probably one tank of fuel each and I'd intend to pay for the car because that would be my treat <pause dur="short"/> but beyond that <pause dur="short"/> as in I would enjoy driving so much <pause dur="short"/> eh but beyond that</u>
<u n="1601" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="1602" who="S0179"><trunc>Ye</trunc> you would pay more on fuel so</u>
<u n="1603" who="S0058">but it's kind of totting it up anyway I guess?</u>
<u n="1604" who="S0179">but none of these options are expensive</u>
<u n="1605" who="S0120">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's all about totting it up</u>
<u n="1606" who="S0058">it is always <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1607" who="S0179">and again none of these options are particularly expensive because that's you know you're not going to spend anything in bars or restaurants you're just going to buy cheap booze and eh</u>
<u n="1608" who="S0058">and cheap food <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>a</trunc> any thoughts on the topic?</u>
<u n="1609" who="S0179">so those are my three leading ideas at the moment <pause dur="short"/> there are also a couple of options in Northumberland erm again a place that's got there's no private hot tubs but there's a swimming pool with a hot tub erm sort of in the complex</u>
<u n="1610" who="S0058">like <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="1611" who="S0179">yep <pause dur="short"/> again very luxurious erm not hugely erm a little bit more expensive <pause dur="short"/> erm slightly better locale as in there's an awful lot to do more locally <pause dur="short"/> so it's right in <unclear/> so you can do walks from the cottage if you wanted to <pause dur="short"/> in a way it would be harder at erm what's it called?</u>
<u n="1612" who="S0058"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1613" who="S0179"><unclear/> Erm fifth option is there's these cottages in <unclear/> eh mobile homes they're permanent caravans</u>
<u n="1614" who="S0058">they're not that cheap</u>
<u n="1615" who="S0179">well they're quite fun and but you have free use of a very nice pool and sauna and Jacuzzi on site and gym</u>
<u n="1616" who="S0058">but it's not that cheap and they are basically caravans</u>
<u n="1617" who="S0120">I doubt</u>
<u n="1618" who="S0179" trans="overlap">but you are on the coast</u>
<u n="1619" who="S0058">you are on the coast</u>
<u n="1620" who="S0120">I would go away to use a <unclear/> gym in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="1621" who="S0179">they're not caravans they're permanent <trunc>cara</trunc> <unclear/> But eh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I have stayed there before and it was very nice</u>
<u n="1622" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> but you and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> were in one of the ones that sleep six?</u>
<u n="1623" who="S0179">no <pause dur="short"/> it only slept four</u>
<u n="1624" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> fine <pause dur="short"/> so you kind of need two places each</u>
<u n="1625" who="S0179">they're the same size</u>
<u n="1626" who="S0058">yeah exactly and that didn't sound massive <pause dur="short"/> I'd be slightly worried with four people in one of those you might end up a bit <pause dur="short"/> I just think with the money they want for one</u>
<u n="1627" who="S0120">it will be cosy</u>
<u n="1628" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> basically</u>
<u n="1629" who="S0179">yeah I</u>
<u n="1630" who="S0058">is that good or bad I'm not sure if you're being sentimental?</u>
<u n="1631" who="S0120"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1632" who="S0179">but it's right on the coast</u>
<u n="1633" who="S0058">as it comes</u>
<u n="1634" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="1635" who="S0058"><unclear/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you'd be like no no cosy <pause dur="short"/> don't want cosy <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
