<u n="162" who="S0013">well I think that the paperwork would do for twenty pound</u>
<u n="163" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I'd leave the costing to them yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0024">well they asked us for for approximate costs for them <unclear/></u>

<u n="179" who="S0024">yeah you don't realise how <trunc>m</trunc> all of this work that you put in I mean like</u>
<u n="180" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0024">well actually we haven't put very much work in <pause dur="short"/> they have</u>

<u n="195" who="S0024">I've lost my vinegar <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> I know</u>
<u n="196" who="S0144">A hundred hours at minimum wage is like six hundred quid</u>
<u n="197" who="S0024">because because it's like a hobby she forgets how long she's spent on it so she can</u>
<u n="198" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="199" who="S0024">and cos they've always been used to having <pause dur="short"/> oh no</u>
