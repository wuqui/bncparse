<u n="213" who="S0439">true lurking outside every door <pause dur="short"/> god <pause dur="short"/> I hope not it's weird though like you always hear the articles in the news and you're like girl walking home gets abducted and you just I'm always just like oh it's never going to happen to me</u>

<u n="216" who="S0441">I know but you can't think like that anyway can you though? cos you'd never go anywhere</u>
<u n="217" who="S0439" trans="overlap">no you just you'd never go out yeah you'd just be <trunc>co</trunc>confined to your home <pause dur="short"/> which is not what anybody wants</u>
<u n="218" who="S0441">car accidents and stuff you always think that will never happen to you</u>
<u n="219" who="S0439">yeah I think I'm quite a safe driver though so but again yeah it's other people isn't it? yeah</u>
<u n="220" who="S0441">I've got a patient who really sad actually they erm were just driving along and a guy veered into the wrong side of the road and crashed into them they both almost died pretty much they both got really bad injuries this is about four years ago but they're still not the same probably never will be</u>
<u n="221" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="222" who="S0441">but that's just liked ruined their life</u>
<u n="223" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="224" who="S0441">and that wasn't their fault it was someone else horrible and they're still waiting as well for money and like compensation and insurance and stuff like that</u>
<u n="225" who="S0439">did you hear how erm Bruce Caitlyn Jenner only got a misdemeanour for killing that woman in the car crash?</u>
<u n="226" who="S0441" trans="overlap">the car crash</u>
<u n="227" who="S0439">I I'm not actually entirely sure what a misdemeanour is but it's definitely not</u>
<u n="228" who="S0441">but then I suppose what are the details? because if I drove say for example if I was driving along and I don't know someone jumped out in front of the road and I didn't have time to stop and I killed them I wouldn't I don't think I'd get arrested for that cos it wouldn't be wouldn't be dangerous driving would it? it would just be an accident</u>
<u n="229" who="S0439">but they don't call them accidents anymore they're called incidents cos apparently there's always somebody responsible</u>
<u n="230" who="S0441">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I don't think I suppose you don't know the details do you of the accident?</u>
<u n="231" who="S0439">no true</u>
<u n="232" who="S0441">cos I suppose that wouldn't be my fault if I</u>
<u n="233" who="S0439">no if you if someone jumped out like if you were driving down the road and somebody actually jumped out in front of you and you killed them</u>
<u n="234" who="S0441" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="235" who="S0439">no I don't think you would get you wouldn't be prosecuted I don't think you would be</u>
<u n="236" who="S0441" trans="overlap">but I suppose you don't know whether let's google it find out what happened with the accident</u>
<u n="237" who="S0439">no cos like from what I gathered he drove into the back of her but I don't know</u>
<u n="238" who="S0441">that is his fault then isn't it? cos that's always always the person's fault</u>
<u n="239" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah although <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s sister was driving and she had someone in the back of her car and it was they were driving through torrential rain and she crashed and he wasn't wearing a seatbelt and he died and his parents didn't press charges so she was never arrested</u>
<u n="240" who="S0441">but is that his fault though?</u>
<u n="241" who="S0439">yeah because he wasn't he was over sixteen if you're if there's people in your car under sixteen apparently the driver is responsible if there's somebody in your car over sixteen apparently the driver isn't responsible</u>
<u n="242" who="S0441">no but in Portugal cos my grandad was like make sure you've got seat belts on at all times because that's his fault anyone in the car is his fault</u>
<u n="243" who="S0439">mm</u>
<u n="244" who="S0441">so it's I suppose it's different isn't it everywhere?</u>
<u n="245" who="S0439">yeah it's like the whole erm you know the <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> situation where he was flirting with a girl in America and like was trying like do you want to sleep with me? and then he got in trouble because she was she was underage no yeah under eighteen and in America you're not allowed to have sex till your eighteen but in England you're allowed to have sex when you're sixteen and she was Scottish or Irish or something</u>
<u n="246" who="S0441">oh so</u>
<u n="247" who="S0439">so actually it's fine</u>
<u n="248" who="S0441" trans="overlap">technically</u>
<u n="249" who="S0439">yeah technically it was fine but everybody is like oh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is a pervert I'm like I'm pretty sure that girl had been banging around since she was erm sixteen</u>
<u n="250" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="251" who="S0439"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="255" who="S0439">okay what happened?</u>
<u n="256" who="S0441">so looks pretty bad</u>
<u n="257" who="S0439">enlighten me</u>
<u n="258" who="S0441">oh so Bruce Jenner's SUV hit a car and pushed it into the path of an oncoming car <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="259" who="S0439">so technically it was the oncoming car that killed her</u>
<u n="260" who="S0441">yeah it occurred on a tricky <trunc>str</trunc>stretch of the highway where road where the road is narrow and twisty <pause dur="short"/> er Kimberly Howe was driving her Lexus blah blah blah when Jenner struck the rim of her car propelling her vehicle into the opposite lanes of traffic Miss Howe's vehicle was then struck head-on by another vehicle killing her</u>
<u n="261" who="S0439">god</u>
<u n="262" who="S0441">awful</u>
<u n="263" who="S0439">so he would get done for hitting the back of her but he couldn't get done for manslaughter because he wasn't the one</u>
<u n="264" who="S0441" trans="overlap">because it wasn't her</u>
<u n="265" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="266" who="S0441">so that's quite a technicality really</u>
<u n="267" who="S0439">I do hate I do hope that the person who did her also was not done for manslaughter or whatever the known kind of the</u>
<u n="268" who="S0441" trans="overlap">mm cos that couldn't also wouldn't be his fault</u>
<u n="269" who="S0439">yeah cos he cos someone pushed her she was in the way of his car yeah</u>
<u n="270" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="271" who="S0439">I don't know I wonder</u>
<u n="272" who="S0441" trans="overlap">er oh it says authorities haven't determined who was at fault in the crash erm</u>
<u n="273" who="S0439">he Jenner must have a fantastic lawyer that's all I can say</u>
<u n="274" who="S0441" trans="overlap">he yeah I very much agree with that</u>
<u n="275" who="S0439">I just can't believe how quickly he's become a woman</u>
<u n="276" who="S0441">I know I think it was going on for quite a long time though</u>
<u n="277" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="278" who="S0441">he was I think he must have taken hormones for quite a long time erm they have opened a vehicular manslaughter case</u>
<u n="279" who="S0439">against Jenner?</u>
<u n="280" who="S0441">it doesn't say</u>
<u n="281" who="S0439">I don't really know how the American justice system works <pause dur="short"/> cos I know they they're not like South Africa they have a jury but the <trunc>ju</trunc> the prosecutor and the defence lawyer are allowed to pick who is allowed or who is going to be on the jury kind of</u>
<u n="282" who="S0441" trans="overlap">mm yeah they can they can</u>
<u n="283" who="S0439">yeah they can veto people but they can pick who is going to be on the jury and interview them can't they?</u>
<u n="284" who="S0441" trans="overlap">yeah and pick who's going to give them the best case</u>
<u n="285" who="S0439">whereas in England you can't do that</u>
<u n="286" who="S0441">nope erm it says she'll only be charged with a misdemeanour reports it was negligence that was the cause so but erm she'll spend one day behind bars</u>
<u n="287" who="S0439">one day behind bars</u>
<u n="288" who="S0441">the maximum penalty for misdemeanour vehicular manslaughter is one year in jail Caitlyn's driving record is <unclear/> clean and she had no prior criminal history so it would be the same in any case wouldn't it really? cos she's got she's</u>
<u n="289" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="290" who="S0441" trans="overlap">I suppose if that happened to me I haven't got any I've got a clean record haven't I? so I suppose they wouldn't say you're going to prison for a year cos that would be not <trunc>ha</trunc> not a threat to society or anything I suppose</u>
<u n="291" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah yeah it's the same as like things like speeding tickets and stuff normally if you get like your first speeding ticket they normally not let you off but they kind of just be like don't ever do that again</u>
<u n="292" who="S0441">yeah it's really awful</u>
<u n="293" who="S0439">it is really sad because no offence but his life will carry on exactly the same way he'll still get all the publicity</u>
<u n="294" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="295" who="S0439">and and that person is now dead because of him essentially</u>
<u n="296" who="S0441">like can't you say you couldn't really it is his fault but you couldn't say that she died because of him I think it was just probably one of those</u>
<u n="297" who="S0439">yeah I guess if there wasn't a car coming in the opposite direction she wouldn't have died</u>
<u n="298" who="S0441" trans="overlap">it would've been a different outcome wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="299" who="S0439">yeah or like whatever he was doing or however he was driving if he hadn't been driving that way that woman possibly would still be alive so</u>
<u n="300" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="301" who="S0439">it's weird but that's the Kardash way not a Kardashian is he? he's a Jenner but me and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> were discussing this today at lunch if you won the lottery would you want your life to change? that's what we thought we were just like</u>
<u n="302" who="S0441">maybe I would go on a few more holidays kind of thing</u>
<u n="303" who="S0439">yeah I like I'd probably buy my sister a house in Paris and probably buy my parents something if they wanted like a holiday home or something and I'd probably buy myself a house or some or go on travelling or something but apart from that I don't think my life would change dramatically I wouldn't go out partying every weekend or spending thousands and thousands of pounds on jewellery or handbags and shit</u>
<u n="304" who="S0441" trans="overlap">no might give up work for a bit</u>
<u n="305" who="S0439">yeah I might give up work for like a year and go travelling and see the world but it wouldn't</u>
<u n="306" who="S0441">I don't think no I wouldn't think it would change a lot at all</u>
<u n="307" who="S0439">I don't think I'd become like superficial and just spend loads of money on what I hate is when people get money and then buy sports cars and crap like that it's just such a waste of money</u>
<u n="308" who="S0441">I wonder if these shoes are in the sale? speaking of shopping</u>
