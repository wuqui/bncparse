<u n="87" who="S0255">that's right you're explaining what it actually means rather than just thinking another way of saying it is like well actually how do I actually get</u>
<u n="88" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0255">and and the total essence of what you're saying as well</u>
<u n="90" who="S0257">exactly</u>
<u n="91" who="S0255">isn't it? rather than just the gist of it</u>
<u n="92" who="S0257">exactly like you said about doing tea need to go and do tea</u>

<u n="98" who="S0257">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0255">and they're like right will do will do yeah yeah and I also had somebody when I told said I was going to give somebody a bollocking on there as well</u>

<u n="104" who="S0257">got to reintroduce English to the Americans</u>
<u n="105" who="S0255">yeah exactly exactly I've had one some some of them cos I play a lot of Americans I think when I was when I was off particularly cos of the time difference and stuff</u>
<u n="106" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0255">erm I got playing a lot of Americans and and one of them sort of saying what to the what do the Brits think of the <trunc>En</trunc> of the Americans seriously? and it's just sort of like it's funny cos we you know you don't think I said well I think there's a lot of stereotypical er out there about the Americans I said same as people tend to think all the businessmen in London wear a bowler hat well they don't you know and and I was giving examples like that and the sort of saying you know I said</u>
<u n="108" who="S0257">yeah we're not all Mary Poppins</u>
<u n="109" who="S0255">no exactly exactly and I I sort of said well you know I think a lot of Brits or you know cos it's funny cos you they you always say that I'm a Brit but actually to me I'm English I'm not British I'm English</u>
<u n="110" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0255">all that and I I was saying like you were talking about that and I was I would say the UK but I would say I'm English</u>
<u n="112" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0255">erm and sort of said well you know I think a lot of English people think the Americans are quite brash and loud I said but then we're aware that it's such a huge area and so many different people and you know and that sort of stuff and</u>
<u n="114" who="S0257">so it's almost like saying what do the the English think of Europeans</u>
<u n="115" who="S0255">yeah exactly exactly yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0257">and you do get stereotyped and and you also get the people that are in the headlines mostly so you often base your opinion on people that are making the news and sometimes it's because they're doing bad things and they're</u>
<u n="117" who="S0255">yeah yeah exactly</u>
<u n="118" who="S0257">behaving in a way that gives you a misconception of of the rest of a a culture or a or a country</u>
<u n="119" who="S0255">mm mm yeah one one <trunc>s</trunc> one of the guys was saying how erm like the guns it's totally crazy of there with families shooting each other and you know people shooting and stabbing in the streets and they said it is just totally out of control they said that's not portrayed wrongly that is how it is he said you're just really aware he said he actually said he thought seriously thought about getting a gun a few times but he's got kids and he said there's no way I'd ever risk anything that they could maybe get hold of even if I know it's locked away</u>
<u n="120" who="S0257">well this is the thing a in a in American supermarket not long ago was it a two year old?</u>
<u n="121" who="S0255">yeah yeah pulled it out the bag and shot his mum</u>
<u n="122" who="S0257" trans="overlap">shot his mother</u>
<u n="123" who="S0255">I know it's just yeah exactly and that's what he sort of said you know he's got I don't I think it was like a ten eight and a four year old and he just said there's there's no way I'd ever risk having it in the house because someway something could happen to us or to them</u>
<u n="124" who="S0257">yeah yeah exactly</u>
<u n="125" who="S0255">you know and one of them <unclear/></u>
<u n="126" who="S0257">but I think what what what we are not aware of in this country is how much the gun culture is growing here and you can't I I every morning I scan through the BBC news website</u>
<u n="127" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0257">and you get the world news and I I look at the England news and then I look at the local news and in almost every you know category there's either stabbings or shootings</u>
<u n="129" who="S0255">yeah oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0257">and it's I think we're you get a bit numb to it don't you?</u>
<u n="131" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="132" who="S0257">and and you don't it doesn't register that shock that it should do</u>
<u n="133" who="S0255">no it doesn't no</u>
<u n="134" who="S0257">because you're constantly reading you're seeing it all the time</u>
<u n="135" who="S0255">yeah yeah well I remember well goodness I don't know how old I was I was probably I don't know if I was either a teenager or I was in my twenties because it was somebody who was a few years either older or younger but but</u>
<u n="136" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0255">somebody when I was living in <anon type="place"/> erm and they were murdered erm and it and it was just there was a girl coming home from work and she was say early twenties and and it was she worked in pub and she was murdered and body was dumped quite openly and it was just sort of oh and it and it was a huge huge shock and you think well actually yeah that's thirty-odd years ago or so now but</u>
<u n="138" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0255">now people are <trunc>th</trunc> murdered all the time and it's I I think <trunc>may</trunc> in a way because the news is spread more isn't it?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0255">we've got access now twenty-four hour news and things are put out everywhere and anywhere and everyone's talking about it so I think you're more aware of things that are happening</u>
<u n="142" who="S0257">I know I do sometimes just scan over headlines and and I'll stop myself and I think why hasn't that shocked me? why haven't I been horrified at reading that?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0255">yeah yeah mm</u>
<u n="144" who="S0257">there was one thing yesterday that absolutely horrified me erm and it was a a the the headline was just baby found burning in road</u>
<u n="145" who="S0255">oh right</u>
<u n="146" who="S0257">an an American girl had had had it was a newborn baby she'd dowsed it in some erm accelerant and set it alight and dumped the poor baby in the road and it was still alive when they found it</u>
<u n="147" who="S0255">oh god</u>
<u n="148" who="S0257">and that was that was horrific</u>
<u n="149" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="150" who="S0257">because it was a a newborn baby</u>
<u n="151" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="152" who="S0257">and you've been in the situation where you've had babies yourself and and you think oh I could never do that but you know there's there's obviously a reason she's maybe very very unwell but if it had been an adult and there's been</u>
<u n="153" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0257">there's been several occasions and you just think oh it's happened again yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0255">oh dear that's a shame yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0257">yeah that's it oh that's another one and it doesn't have the same shock behind it</u>
<u n="157" who="S0255" trans="overlap">not impact no exactly no no</u>
<u n="158" who="S0257">no no</u>
<u n="159" who="S0255">no no you're right</u>
<u n="160" who="S0257">it's just the world we live in I suppose I sound like my <trunc>grandm</trunc> no I never knew my grandmother but I sound like a grandmother</u>
<u n="161" who="S0255">sounds like yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah it's scary how that happens</u>
<u n="162" who="S0257">talking of grandmother and generations I was talking to my dad this morning about something that I think you might be interested in</u>
<u n="163" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0257">you might already have seen it Peterborough train station in during the First World War</u>
<u n="165" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0257">was a hub for er serviceman travelling the country</u>
<u n="167" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0257">and they had a er a tea room at the train station</u>
<u n="169" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0257">and they have visitor's books there so the serviceman were all writing little comments some of them were a bit some of them were a bit erm how did it word it? some of them were a bit er a bit fresh and fruity about the girls serving the tea cos some of these lads haven't been in the proximity of a woman for quite some time</u>
<u n="171" who="S0255">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0257">but Peterborough erm museum erm is wanting to get them transcribed so they can put them on the website</u>
<u n="173" who="S0255">mm right</u>
<u n="174" who="S0257">so that cos they know that you know the guys all put the date and put their little comments and they want to start publishing them exactly a hundred years to the day</u>
<u n="175" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="176" who="S0257">when they were written</u>
<u n="177" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0257">and it was fascinating enough as it was but they're looking for volunteers to to do the transcribing</u>
<u n="179" who="S0255">right yeah</u>
<u n="180" who="S0257">and I I told my dad cos I know it's the sort of thing he'd be really really keen to get involved in erm and he'd already seen it but I didn't know whether it might be something that you would be if if not get involved in it then just follow yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0255">is it do you have to actually you know go go there to actually do it or do they get stuff out or?</u>
<u n="182" who="S0257">I don't know I don't know it's just</u>
<u n="183" who="S0255">I'll make a note of that cos it's</u>
<u n="184" who="S0257">it was on the BBC website if I had more hours in my day</u>
<u n="185" who="S0255">yeah well that's what I'm thinking if I'd if I'd known about this last June I could have sat doing it all and</u>
<u n="186" who="S0257">no it only made the news this week</u>
<u n="187" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="188" who="S0257">so it was on the BBC erm and it was in the local Cambridgeshire news for it my eldest sister actually heard it on BBC radio Cambridgeshire</u>

<u n="532" who="S0257">mm yeah</u>
<u n="533" who="S0256">we'll see er we're doing a trial at the minute to see whether or not we can eliminate erm all the documents needing to be sent in so I'm part of that which has been quite fun</u>
<u n="534" who="S0257">oh good</u>
<u n="535" who="S0256">but we just have to see what management think whether they think long term it's something that'll work or not</u>
<u n="536" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="537" who="S0256">it's erm there's lots of stuff going on at the minute we're getting first aid trained at the beginning of next month which is one of those three days courses</u>

<u n="545" who="S0257">mm that'll be excellent</u>
<u n="546" who="S0255">mm it's good</u>
<u n="547" who="S0257">I erm I was emergency first aider at work and that expired just before Christmas and I said to erm to our finance director I said I won't renew it for myself to be honest I did it because my children well they weren't little <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was fifteen <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> would have been eighteen at the time</u>
<u n="548" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="549" who="S0257">erm and I just thought you know when you've got kids it anything can happen and it you you it just helps it just gives that bit more confidence doesn't it? I said but I know that there are some other people that have mentioned it to me erm that would be interested in doing them so I'll give somebody else a chance</u>
<u n="550" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="551" who="S0257">I need to organise that actually thank you</u>
<u n="552" who="S0255">I'm just reminding you</u>
<u n="553" who="S0257">yeah yeah but I was thinking about it in the week cos I took my certificate down so it's left a space on the wall and every time I walked passed it I think mm</u>
<u n="554" who="S0255">you see the space it's like ah yes need to do that</u>
<u n="555" who="S0257">yeah well I'd left it up over Christmas and then registered that it was it was out of date you know in the in the in my mind I knew it was out of date I need to organise somebody but I thought If I take it down it'll be another prod</u>
<u n="556" who="S0255">tomorrow morning you'll walk in and go ah need to need to do I</u>
<u n="557" who="S0257">first aid</u>
<u n="558" who="S0255">have you got room now?</u>
<u n="559" who="S0257">yeah I'm done now thank you</u>
<u n="560" who="S0256">we already have quite a few first aiders at work</u>
<u n="561" who="S0255">well it's a big building isn't it?</u>
<u n="562" who="S0257">how many are there? people who work there?</u>
<u n="563" who="S0256">well we've got three floors of people erm I think there's I don't think there's a thousand I think it's under a thousand but yeah there's quite a fair few I'm not sure exactly how many we already have quite a few first aiders erm distributed</u>
<u n="564" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="565" who="S0256">we've got two on our floor and I'll be the third well in our command area</u>
<u n="566" who="S0257">yeah cos we've got well we are we've we've been in that building for ten years and as the <trunc>bui</trunc> as the company has grown we've outgrown the building so we've got a whole building which is just two floors there's only twenty-six of us there it's not it's not massive by any stretch of the imagination and then five floors down in the business part we've got the lower floor it's the the buildings are identical we've got the lower floor there with about fourteen people there so there's about forty people altogether so I've got one first aider in that I think we only need one first aider for the number of people but what we've done we've got one on each floor</u>
<u n="567" who="S0255">yeah it makes sense cos if somebody isn't there yeah definitely</u>
<u n="568" who="S0257" trans="overlap">and it covers the holidays and things as well yeah yeah yeah and we've just introduced for the first of January we've just introduced sick pay</u>
<u n="569" who="S0255">oh right</u>
<u n="570" who="S0257">our benefits have increased so we were required by our parent company to coming up for three years ago in April and at that point we'll all have we've all stayed on our own contracts so we've got twenty-five days holiday plus all the bank holidays parent company you start on twenty days and then after you've done so long I think it's like after you've done two years or a a full calendar year a full January to December so if you started on the second of January no that's the first working day third of January tough tits you've got to do all that year and then a full calendar year</u>
<u n="571" who="S0255">yeah and then yeah</u>
<u n="572" who="S0257">you would then get an incremental day's holiday each year erm so we've always been able to say when we're recruiting this is one thing that makes our benefits <trunc>pa</trunc> package better if you were to work for the group</u>
<u n="573" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="574" who="S0257">or when we send people for inductions you know it's don't mention that we get twenty-five days holiday cos they don't don't mention that we get Bupa because they don't</u>
<u n="575" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="576" who="S0257">erm but from the first of January it's been streamlined as much as possible so everybody else now gets twenty-five days but we've also had the been given the opportunity to buy a holiday up to five days and we all also get a day for our birthday</u>
<u n="577" who="S0255">oh yeah? right</u>
<u n="578" who="S0257">so my birthday's in April and I don't have to take the day I can take any day within my birthday month</u>
<u n="579" who="S0255">oh that's nice</u>
<u n="580" who="S0257">and that's a full day yeah it is it is cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I we always try and take our birthdays off a few days around our birthday erm so I've booked mine it's a Thursday so I've booked Thursday Friday cos that'll make if we don't do anything that'll just make a really long weekend and I've had taken one day out of it to do it and I I've bought three days holiday because last year I took I think about two two and a half days that I took half a day here or a full day there to go and go events</u>
<u n="581" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="582" who="S0257">erm so I've bought those three days this year so I can still do that but not dip out on my holiday yeah</u>
<u n="583" who="S0255">not lose your holiday holiday yeah</u>
<u n="584" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="585" who="S0255">mm yeah</u>
<u n="586" who="S0257">erm so that's been really good that's been we thought a lot more people might take <trunc>a</trunc> take it up actually but we haven't had we haven't had a huge number of people but surprisingly they've been from two teams there's one team with six people in it and five of them have bought five extra days</u>
<u n="587" who="S0255">yeah?</u>
<u n="588" who="S0257">so I said to our finance director you know the team er team manager is signing them all off it's one of the busiest teams I do hope they're gonna have the resource to cover and extra five weeks of holiday in that team which is what they're basically going to give he said well he's authorising it's his job to cover the resource</u>
<u n="589" who="S0255">yeah I suppose if they've got the option that they can buy five days holiday he can't say no can he?</u>
<u n="590" who="S0257">no well we did ask this question of HR and they said he'd have to put a very good business case across</u>
<u n="591" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="592" who="S0257">and you might say well you've all requested five days we because of this or because of work load we'll give you all four days or three days or none of you are going to get it but it'd have to be a business case and all of them be giving the same answer but one of the other benefits we've introduced as well is paid sick</u>
<u n="593" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="594" who="S0257">paid sicknesses which we haven't had you'd have to be off for four working days and then SSP kicks in</u>
<u n="595" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="596" who="S0257">but erm we've now get paid sick and where are we today? eighteenth aren't we? yeah it's my niece's birthday yeah the eighteenth and we've had more sickness than than we've had before</u>
<u n="597" who="S0256">mm that's the thing there isn't I think you know if you're <unclear/> or whatever and you don't get paid for it it can affect things you'll come in even if you feel like absolute death</u>
<u n="598" who="S0257">well this is what has been said yeah</u>
<u n="599" who="S0256">whereas now if you've got the option like now if I'm if I'm like in my probation when I felt ill I went in and I really shouldn't have gone in at one point my glands was like out here and I was really bad and I had two bouts like that but I still went in because I didn't want to affect my probation now if I got that I'd probably be like I'm not going in</u>
<u n="600" who="S0257">well this is the thing that we we were talking about it and erm er yeah we're we're a small company our teams are I think the largest team has got six people in</u>
<u n="601" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="602" who="S0257">so there's three four five six people teams you know if one person is off it it really impacts the others if it's not holiday if it's not planned resource-wise</u>
<u n="603" who="S0255">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="604" who="S0257">so and also we we just lose a day's pay or two days' pay or whatever it might be so you'd go into work and you'd cough and splutter and then twenty-four hours later</u>
<u n="605" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah and then your rest of the team</u>
<u n="606" who="S0257">twenty-four hours later somebody else would say oh I've got the you know er I think I'm coming down with it erm so we can imagine now instead of people battling for a week and then giving in on a Friday but they've given it to another four people who are gonna battle for a week and give it another <trunc>fi</trunc></u>
<u n="607" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="608" who="S0257">they'll take a couple of days off get rid of it and come in and nobody else would have caught it and so in the long-run</u>
<u n="609" who="S0255">yeah it is benefit</u>
<u n="610" who="S0257">it will save on</u>
<u n="611" who="S0256">well that's that's right I mean we had someone that was on <unclear/> or she she'd had quite a bit of sickness and she had a sickness bug and came in</u>
<u n="612" who="S0257">er</u>
<u n="613" who="S0256">and I was like you do realise you've got a sickness? like you're gonna pass that on to people</u>
<u n="614" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="615" who="S0256">I said it's not fair I said cos like this was last year and I had lots of stuff that I had coming up and I was like I cannot be ill cos if I'm ill and I give it to my nan she can't go and visit her sister and she can't do this</u>
<u n="616" who="S0257">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="617" who="S0256">and all this sort of stuff and I'm like so you've got to think of the impact and like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> my friend her erm fiancé his parents his dad I think it is is has got cancer and they've been going in and out of hospital and if she gets it she visit him they can't go and visit him and I'm like you got to think of the implications you're doing for other people if you've got a sickness bug you need to go home</u>
<u n="618" who="S0255">yeah sickness is</u>
<u n="619" who="S0257">you can't manage it at work either can you?</u>
<u n="620" who="S0255">no exactly no</u>
<u n="621" who="S0256">if you've got a cold you can usually come in but</u>
<u n="622" who="S0255">yeah that's it's it's to be clever about it isn't it?</u>
<u n="623" who="S0256">yeah yeah this is it but it was a real grotty grotty cold and you're spluttering coughing trying to</u>
<u n="624" who="S0256" trans="overlap">exactly <unclear/></u>
<u n="625" who="S0255">yeah couple of days off definitely if it's a bit of a sniffle you think oh actually it's a bit of a sniffle you then you go in don't you?</u>
<u n="626" who="S0256">before Christmas like we had our Christmas party on Friday the <trunc>tw</trunc>twelfth of December but on that day itself erm we have a field-based sales team there's only a small number of them but they were all on site cos we had our year-end meeting we had our awards erm and then we had our party in the evening and one of the guys that day he said he said to me I feel really ill and I was like oh suck it up <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> come on don't be such a baby you're alright oh you maybe got a bit of a temperature and I can't I I think I might have sort of put my hand on the on his forehead like this you might be a bit warm but I said you're alright don't be such a baby get on with it and the I didn't really see him at the Christmas party but apparently he came out with some red marks on his face cos he said to our MD typical party night and I come out in spots</u>
<u n="627" who="S0255">mm mm</u>
<u n="628" who="S0257">erm and he phoned in sick on Monday and he said he'd got hand foot and mouth</u>
<u n="629" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="630" who="S0257">I had that when <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was little I caught if off her cos it's a it's a child's disease and er three other people came down with it as well so of course we were there saying oh what were you doing at the Christmas party? one of them was the MD's wife</u>
<u n="631" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="632" who="S0257">one of them was one of our guys in engineering so I don't know how that happened but we think cos they were buying round after round of erm Jägerbombs</u>
<u n="633" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="634" who="S0257">and they were using the you know the all-in-one looks a bit like a candle holder</u>
<u n="635" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="636" who="S0257">the all-in-one erm cup</u>
<u n="637" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="638" who="S0257">but we don't think that or glass I think they were plastic but they weren't don't think they were washing them cos they were buying so many at a time</u>
<u n="639" who="S0255">mm yeah</u>
<u n="640" who="S0257">it would have been a lot to wash sterilise and get out again</u>
<u n="641" who="S0255">that's it they probably just swished them out and</u>
<u n="642" who="S0257">yeah so we think that's how it went around</u>
<u n="643" who="S0255">or we went back and said oh use the same glasses and that somebody actually got mixed over or ever just touching the glasses if somebody was carrying it</u>
<u n="644" who="S0257">well they put them all on a tray and then the tray was going back so there was absolutely no way you could get the same one again</u>
<u n="645" who="S0255">no no no</u>
<u n="646" who="S0257">erm but one of the girls she come she she she phoned in they have to phone in every day and speak to me cos she said I feel absolutely fine she said I feel well enough to work</u>
<u n="647" who="S0255">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="648" who="S0257">but I'm contagious she said I don't want to lose <trunc>se</trunc> don't want you to lose money because I am well I'm telling you I'm willing to come into work</u>
<u n="649" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="650" who="S0257">but chances are that somebody else will catch it from me and when we found out it was on a Friday afternoon we thought oh god okay I need to tell everybody there's going to be panic so I sent out an email to say we've had at that point here instances of this this is what it is this is a link to the NHS website about it have a look at it look out for symptoms I'm coming round with antibacterial wipes and we wiped every single surface in that building well in those two buildings entrance doors light bulbs taps the kettle handles every single thing fridge handles everything we could think of erm so we didn't have sick pay at that point but I I sat down with the finance director on Friday and I said look these people have had this you know we said to one of them that's fine we don't want you in we're telling you not to come in cos you're contagious so we'll pay you and she said now it'll be exactly the same for all four of them so yeah something like that like you say about passing things on</u>
<u n="651" who="S0255">yeah yeah mm</u>
<u n="652" who="S0257">you don't want anything that's gonna spread</u>
<u n="653" who="S0256">no exactly like I can't believe most people will manage a cold even if it's a nasty one like you you get it and you're like for goodness sake I've got this cold but you're you're not gonna be laid up for it you know if somebody comes in with their sickness bug that can have a big effect on people especially because obviously our office is quite big and we've usually got two or three people pregnant at a time and if it gets to them you think it's not fair to give something like that to them</u>
<u n="654" who="S0257">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="655" who="S0256">I mean a cold again if someone is pregnant has a cold they have a cold but sickness bugs it's not right</u>
<u n="656" who="S0257">no it's</u>
<u n="657" who="S0255">no</u>
<u n="658" who="S0256">cos they've got massive like air conditioning our air conditioning vents are huge they're huge machines</u>
<u n="659" who="S0257">oh god so what it goes spread around</u>
<u n="660" who="S0256">everything spread because obviously we have to keep the air conditioning in there because and we can't have there there's no windows</u>
<u n="661" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="662" who="S0256">there's vents but there's no windows cos it's just like a glass building</u>
<u n="663" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="664" who="S0256">so obviously the windows are so big someone could jump out of it it was a window so they have vents</u>
<u n="665" who="S0255">and sometimes they might want to</u>
<u n="666" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="667" who="S0255">god I've had enough</u>
<u n="668" who="S0256">erm so we have vents but the vents level with the air conditioning so they stay shut</u>
<u n="669" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="670" who="S0256">so it's all run on air conditioned air so everything just gets passed round so so fast in our place like you'll hear about it on the second floor and you'll go it's coming our way then</u>
<u n="671" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="672" who="S0257">like a wave</u>
<u n="673" who="S0256">no cos someone we have <trunc>mo</trunc> most of us like in <unclear/> we just tend to stay on our floor apart from when we go down to the eat rooms like on a break we tend to stay on our floor but we have erm support clerks that walk around the building taking post taking</u>
<u n="674" who="S0257">germs</u>
<u n="675" who="S0256">everything and the mail room yeah and the mail room people as well they walk round the building so there's two lots generally you'll see wandering round the building they pass the germs from floor to floor so you just know you're get it if it's on the second floor it's coming to the third floor at some point <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="676" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="677" who="S0256">but erm yeah but</u>
<u n="678" who="S0257">yeah some of these things you can't avoid can you?</u>
<u n="679" who="S0256">no but if it is yeah usually there's some form of cold or something going round</u>
<u n="680" who="S0257">erm one of our ladies well a couple of them actually have got really bad erm well one girl she's got she's got food allergies</u>
<u n="681" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="682" who="S0257">but it's not just gluten or wheat or nuts it's erm she can't eat anything from the oh I can't remember what it's called family of vegetables that includes broccoli cabbage sprouts there's quite a few in there erm yeast</u>
<u n="683" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="684" who="S0257">which is in so many more things than you think it's gonna be in</u>
<u n="685" who="S0255">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="686" who="S0257">cos I said to her the other day erm because she she can't eat flour she can't eat normal gluten or she can't eat normal flour because of the gluten I think it is erm so if there are cakes around somebody often bring brings fruit as well and I said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> there's grapes she said it's got yeast the grape skins have yeast in them that's what helps the wine ferment</u>
<u n="687" who="S0255">mm yeah</u>
<u n="688" who="S0257">oh <trunc>po</trunc> the Christmas party organising a meal for her it's</u>
<u n="689" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="690" who="S0257">so difficult but it doesn't take much if she accidently eats something that triggers it and she's in agony and you'll see her sitting here like this and I'll say to her <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> go home and she'll say I can't afford to lose a day's pay</u>
<u n="691" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="692" who="S0257">so she will just sit there in in agony</u>
<u n="693" who="S0256">mm</u>
<u n="694" who="S0257">quite literally agony erm until and she just we would see the colour draining from her during the day</u>
<u n="695" who="S0256">you want to tell her to get erm maybe she's got one like one of those mini hot water bottles cos sometimes that can</u>
<u n="696" who="S0257">she has them yeah</u>
<u n="697" who="S0256">cos I cos I if my stomach's playing I use one of them I sit with one of them on my stomach and just sit and hold it and it's help with all</u>
<u n="698" who="S0257">it's it's a bit of a a bit of a erm a laughing point in our office because there are so many girls that for one reason or another one of them is she's got the the figure of a seven year old well she's she's chesty but she's very very tiny she's about a size four I think</u>
<u n="699" who="S0255">yes yeah</u>
<u n="700" who="S0257">erm and where she sits she refuses to move cos she likes the the the position but it's directly beneath the air con vents but we don't often have the air con on but then when the MD is in he likes fresh air in his office</u>
<u n="701" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="702" who="S0257">and erm the the it's the glass walls with the glass door so you haven't got doors that seal erm and when he's not in his office he <trunc>of</trunc> well even when he's in there the door is open normally unless he's on a private phone call</u>
<u n="703" who="S0256">yeah that's the same with our with our boss he does</u>
<u n="704" who="S0257">so if the window is open there's a bit of a a breeze</u>
<u n="705" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="706" who="S0257">well I'm where his door opens I've got a glass screen that comes in front of mine I'm in a little alcove basically so I don't feel anything</u>
<u n="707" who="S0255">no no</u>
<u n="708" who="S0257">if it's over-warm in the office I don't really notice it is it's drafty I don't feel it if the air con's on I barely get a waft of it</u>
<u n="709" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="710" who="S0257">but erm one of the the this lady that I was talking about she'll even in the summer when we don't have the air conditioning on she'll sit in a thick cardigan because windows are open and there's a nice breeze but she feels she really feels the cold erm and we must have four or five hot water bottles at any <trunc>sta</trunc> lines up near the kettle at any stage waiting to be filled up again</u>
<u n="711" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="712" who="S0257">one of the girls got one for Christmas from secret Santa</u>
<u n="713" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="714" who="S0257">as well cos hers was a bit tatty</u>
<u n="715" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="716" who="S0257">and I knitted a cover for one girl</u>
<u n="717" who="S0255">did you?</u>
<u n="718" who="S0256">the thing is in our building like erm I came in once in summer and I was dressed in like in leggings and a dress and I had a cardigan</u>
<u n="719" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="720" who="S0256">and <unclear/> goes to me you dressed for the Arctic? it's boiling I was like my office is so cold</u>
<u n="721" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="722" who="S0256">it's literally freezing even in the summer you're like frozen</u>
<u n="723" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="724" who="S0256">because they have to have it because of the way the building is set out it's very it's all open plan</u>
<u n="725" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="726" who="S0256">apart from a few offices like we've got erm like there's my boss's boss's boss her they've got individual offices but everyone else we're all in open plan so if one air conditioning is put up to say it's <trunc>sup</trunc> they're all supposed to be on twenty-four or twenty-five but then they all have to be on that</u>
<u n="727" who="S0257">right</u>
<u n="728" who="S0256">cos if one's put on thirty the ones that are on twenty-four start overcompensating</u>
<u n="729" who="S0257">oh</u>
<u n="730" who="S0256">and blowing out <trunc>co</trunc> er cold air on a on a constant thing so then if you're in that area you're frozen because someone else is warm but they can't put them all up because then people start moaning and saying it's too hot so they have they have an agreed temperature but that is really cold so most of us are sat there and <unclear/> I I bought a drink in once that was warm I hadn't a sip yet put it on my desk about half an hour later it was cold</u>
<u n="731" who="S0257">mm mm</u>
<u n="732" who="S0256">cos the air conditioning cools it it's just like a giant fridge so you can leave your leave your lunch inside and it's fine</u>
<u n="733" who="S0257">nice and chilled</u>
<u n="734" who="S0256">yeah but it's it is quite cold I mean like it's not too bad now because they've managed to get it we've got the air conditioning so it's mostly now it's warm where I was sat I was directly under where it hit</u>
<u n="735" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="736" who="S0256">and I was cold constantly so my boss moved me erm she swapped me someone else and I've now sat and it would actually it goes just over me now it's not bad but I was literally frozen I was sat in my coat it'd be that cold it's like we can't do this and we had sort of like a phase where we don't know why but it was blowing I think it was because we've got heating but they'd moved a load of erm cos they were doing <trunc>re</trunc> like renovation work around the corner they'd moved all the lockers in front of one set of heating our set of heating is already covered by cupboards so we had no heating near us so we were sat and my my friend actually went home early used some of her her flexi time to go home early because she was so cold</u>
<u n="737" who="S0257">that's rubbish isn't it?</u>
<u n="738" who="S0256">yeah and we should <trunc>we</trunc> it's not fair we said this is ridiculous we move our heating was already blocked that's next to us cos you go to the cupboard to get something out oh paper's warm <unclear/> workboxes again are we? that's fine cos you can't the the heat just doesn't come over</u>
<u n="739" who="S0257">no no no</u>
<u n="740" who="S0256">and then the ones we did have then got blocked in as well and we were like but now they've moved them back in cos they've done the work they've moved the lockers back so it's actually it's been lovely</u>
<u n="741" who="S0257">heatwave</u>
<u n="742" who="S0256">it's nice it's actually a bit warm it's not not hot but it's a bit warmer that in it was so <pause dur="short"/> so silly I just think if you're cold you should be able to put the heating up or put the turn the air con down but no cos everyone else's goes mad but I think as well part of them is where they've got the air conditioning units you've got the heaters and then directly above them there's the air conditioning so I think the heat goes up and the air conditioning thinks it's hotter than it is and then it blows off cold</u>
<u n="743" who="S0257">probably does</u>
<u n="744" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="745" who="S0257">who planned that?</u>
<u n="746" who="S0256">I don't it's so so such a silly design and I don't know I think it was the only place they could put the erm air conditioning vent that where a group sort of like by the I don't know health and safety and everyone like that so that they distributed it right but they are just directly above the heating which means that they just don't know what the temperature is and it's like it's not twenty-four degrees in here it feels more like sort of fifteen sixteen degrees it's really cold</u>
<u n="747" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="748" who="S0256">I was just thinking of getting <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s temperature gauge thing and just temparturing around the office just to say</u>
<u n="749" who="S0257">actually</u>
<u n="750" who="S0256">that's not right</u>
<u n="751" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="752" who="S0256">but there's nothing they can do it about it now because the way it's designed is the way it's designed I don't think they can change it</u>
<u n="753" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="754" who="S0256">er no somebody we'll be sat there and somebody'll go oh the air conditioning's gone on cos obviously it's one of the ones that goes on a lot like it's on power save so when so we get a draft like blow in your ear it's like year air conditioning's coming on</u>
<u n="755" who="S0257">yeah our boiler not last winter the winter <trunc>be</trunc> yeah it was last winter actually our boiler packed up so we had to get a quote for a replacement then we had to book it in to get it replaced so for about two weeks we had no heating so I had to hire industrial heaters they were like rockets</u>
<u n="756" who="S0255">yeah space heaters</u>
<u n="757" who="S0257">glowing orange with this heating coming out oh god had to hire these all around the building it was lovely it was so toasty with this warm air blowing instead of just a radiator emitting a bit of heat</u>
<u n="758" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="759" who="S0257">actually have the warm air blowing around</u>
<u n="760" who="S0256"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="761" who="S0257">but it was so dry we were drinking tonnes and all erm you know dry lips dry skin as well so of course we were complaining</u>
<u n="762" who="S0255">we've got one of those the erm the big ones</u>
<u n="763" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="764" who="S0255">it's down in the garage <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had a few years ago for something and when I used to sell the socks they were all in the garage and I used to go down to pack and it's absolutely freezing in a winter and I used to put that one him he could walk in and it was like he he'd say are you alright? I would say yes I'm fine thank you</u>
<u n="765" who="S0256">but your hands would be so numb</u>
<u n="766" who="S0257">oh be a</u>
<u n="767" who="S0256">you wouldn't be able to <unclear/> the bits to stick on the</u>
<u n="768" who="S0257">no I know to put it on the packet</u>
<u n="769" who="S0256">I used to I used to go and put it on</u>
<u n="770" who="S0255">yeah it's like this little tiny garage and <trunc>y</trunc> and you just go on <unclear/> and then it was so warm you'd turn it off and almost straightaway you'd see the temperature would just drop because it doesn't keep it warm does it?</u>
<u n="771" who="S0257">no</u>

<u n="829" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="830" who="S0256" trans="overlap">I think it's when when you take your dog for a walk generally they get used to going on the walk so they don't go in the garden</u>
<u n="831" who="S0257" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="832" who="S0255">no cos it's they think it's like an extension of the house that they shouldn't go in maybe</u>
<u n="833" who="S0257" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="834" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah yeah exactly whereas the girls go in the garden because they don't go for walks they've got such a big garden that they the back door's open pretty much <trunc>co</trunc> all day and they just run in and out and come and run as <trunc>mu</trunc> round as much as they want</u>
<u n="835" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="836" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="837" who="S0256">so they go out in the garden</u>
<u n="838" who="S0257" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="839" who="S0256">but again they'll only go there's certain areas that they'll go in</u>
<u n="840" who="S0257" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="841" who="S0256">cos it's they're the areas they're supposed to use</u>
<u n="842" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="843" who="S0256">so I think that's what it is the dogs when you take them for a walk that's when they go to the loo so if you took her for a walk in the morning she probably would go</u>
<u n="844" who="S0257">yeah probably probably</u>
<u n="845" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="846" who="S0256">even if you literally just took her for a quick loop round the <trunc>r</trunc>round the</u>
<u n="847" who="S0257" trans="overlap">park yeah</u>
<u n="848" who="S0256">like round the place or whatever then she probably would go</u>

<u n="853" who="S0256">like we've had occasionally over the road where they've been in for a while and you can tell they're desperate cos they go to the door and then they go by the door cos they know they're supposed to be going out but they they can't actually go out</u>
<u n="854" who="S0257" trans="overlap">yeah close as they can get</u>
<u n="855" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="856" who="S0256">the thing is you is like you say you've let them out and they haven't gone so you think oh they're fine and then all of the sudden it's like oh okay you needed to go okay that's fine</u>
<u n="857" who="S0257">yeah the only time Holly's <pause dur="short"/> it's been an accident because she's been unwell</u>
