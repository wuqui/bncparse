<u n="110" who="S0254">a tumble dryer</u>
<u n="111" who="S0253">cos their parents have them and you don't have to iron anything</u>
<u n="112" who="S0254">I know they are nice</u>
<u n="113" who="S0253">everything comes out like warm and fresh</u>
<u n="114" who="S0254">they just use to much electricity</u>
<u n="115" who="S0253">mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0254">if we had one of those little Odometer things like how much electricity you're using</u>
<u n="117" who="S0253">they were saying the other day I don't know what's up with them I don't know whether you said that the parameters of it and say you know this how much energy I</u>
<u n="118" who="S0254">no no just tells you how much it uses</u>
<u n="119" who="S0253">it keeps giving my parents warnings and telling them they're like killing Penguins</u>
<u n="120" who="S0254">I don't know about that</u>
<u n="121" who="S0253">I say we went one one morning we were in the house and I hadn't like I'm just going to shut that I hadn't like watched TV had a shower or anything and my mum and dad don't really use much energy by the time I got downstairs at ten in the morning my dad had had the grill on and it just cooks so it's going <vocal desc="nonsense"/> making this noise and it was like yeah like you've used X amount of energy today</u>
<u n="122" who="S0254">maybe they had it set really low  don't put anything on</u>
<u n="123" who="S0253">eco mode</u>
<u n="124" who="S0254">like you have one light on the light on in one room for five minutes it's like electricity used</u>
<u n="125" who="S0253">but their whole thing was like and I guess it is good cos it's people it's like probably didn't realise how much energy they were using cos you do forget</u>
<u n="126" who="S0254">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0253">and it's also interesting about like different things how</u>
<u n="128" who="S0254">Doctor Mick</u>
<u n="129" who="S0253">and I think it's Dermick</u>
<u n="130" who="S0254">Dermick</u>
<u n="131" who="S0253">Dermick his name</u>
<u n="132" who="S0254">Dermot bought Swiss</u>
<u n="133" who="S0253">yeah yes definitely</u>
<u n="134" who="S0254">exactly like that</u>
<u n="135" who="S0253">no erm but I think the idea is you know it keeps people sort of aware of what they're using it's like any sort of like alarm that you buy there's things you just do everyday and you don't think how much money you're spend here</u>
<u n="136" who="S0254">yeah cos you just like fritter away</u>
<u n="137" who="S0253">keep keep</u>
<u n="138" who="S0254">get lunch on a card or petrol on the card</u>
<u n="139" who="S0253">or people who keep like food diaries and you know it's only like those people</u>
<u n="140" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0253">from channel four have got a pile of food on the table</u>
<u n="142" who="S0254">in a tube</u>
<u n="143" who="S0253">and you realise what you use and what you eat in a day</u>
<u n="144" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0253">and I suppose it's a good thing for that but</u>
<u n="146" who="S0254">cos I went through I had an app on my phone for a while and I put in exactly what I and I totted up how many calories</u>
<u n="147" who="S0253">should be dead</u>
<u n="148" who="S0254">cos I felt like what</u>
<u n="149" who="S0253">laughs</u>
<u n="150" who="S0254">what are you laughing</u>
<u n="151" who="S0253">it's just laughs it how long did it take to fit it all in</u>
<u n="152" who="S0254">how rude I don't eat loads</u>
<u n="153" who="S0253">you constantly snack</u>
<u n="154" who="S0254">no I don't actually I do  don't</u>
<u n="155" who="S0253">you do</u>
<u n="156" who="S0254">I don't I could tell you I've eaten look breakfast had breakfast at home I had lunch at lunchtime I had two chocolate fingers in the afternoon and then I had nothing for tea and then I've just had pudding that's a perfectly rationable rational amount of food</u>
<u n="157" who="S0253">that is a very rational amount of food</u>
<u n="158" who="S0254">but erm yeah like I was trying to just to see you know that secret eater programme particularly in my last job cos we had a box</u>
<u n="159" who="S0253">yeah biscuits</u>
<u n="160" who="S0254">we had a box full of food and in just in the office when like whenever it was starting to get low someone would bring in a box of maltesers and biscuits and it was just constantly</u>
<u n="161" who="S0253">oh my word</u>
<u n="162" who="S0254">always in the office and any time you went to go to the loo or to do the door or to the filing cabinet you had to pass this magical box of food so of course you just</u>
<u n="163" who="S0253">and if you didn't have to you found a way to pass it</u>
<u n="164" who="S0254">exactly and then when you're sat there bored like if your bored in work the only thing you can do that's enjoyable is either make a couple of tea go to the toilet or eat something</u>
<u n="165" who="S0253">erm I enjoy going to I enjoy going to the bathroom cos I know I'll be left alone</u>
<u n="166" who="S0254">yeah I know I found myself just sitting in there for a little while</u>
<u n="167" who="S0253">that's what I do as well</u>
<u n="168" who="S0254">it's quiet nobody can bother me</u>
<u n="169" who="S0253">sounds weird I just like I just lie to chill cos I just know that if I'm in the hall I'll get stopped by someone</u>
<u n="170" who="S0254">yeah but I suppose my job's the opposite trying to find things to do look I'll go to the toilet drag that out for as long as you possibly can</u>
<u n="171" who="S0253">our bathroom's dead small</u>
<u n="172" who="S0254">mm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0253">but no the thing is like I wouldn't eat like you know I don't snack and I don't really eat like loads but like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> brings in like she's such a keen foodie an d baker and she erm she brings in like she makes at home did I tell you this the other day she made fudge she made fudge at home</u>
<u n="174" who="S0254">that's insane</u>
<u n="175" who="S0253">like chocolate</u>
<u n="176" who="S0254">like who makes fudge at home</u>
<u n="177" who="S0253">fudge American people do</u>
<u n="178" who="S0254">nice yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/>  Americans do</u>
<u n="179" who="S0253">cos Americans  do know how to enjoy their food English people would be like I couldn't possibly make fudge at home</u>
<u n="180" who="S0254">I wouldn't know where to start making fudge</u>
<u n="181" who="S0253">and she makes stuff like cinnamon toast for breakfast that you fry it's like</u>
<u n="182" who="S0254">fried bread</u>
<u n="183" who="S0253">fried bread in sugar and cinnamon</u>
<u n="184" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="185" who="S0253">it's beautiful it is nice I had it</u>
<u n="186" who="S0254">oh yeah I'm sure it is</u>
<u n="187" who="S0253">she made it for me once but I think it's the attitude it's like if you're gonna make something indulge make it indulgent don't like</u>
<u n="188" who="S0254">well you have to do it half half</u>
<u n="189" who="S0253">yeah don't you know sort of like feel guilty for having a dessert it's going to be a dessert</u>
<u n="190" who="S0254">might as well enjoy it</u>
<u n="191" who="S0253">but yeah so she brought in this big tub of fudge and I would never think to myself if I was I sitting there on my own I'd never think got I really fancy some fudge now but she put it the minute the it's also the anonymity thing</u>
<u n="192" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="193" who="S0253">like in the staffroom in our staffroom</u>
<u n="194" who="S0254">did she have a little label on it saying eat me</u>
<u n="195" who="S0253">yeah but it's not about it's not anonymous in our office cos there's only she and I who you know if someone's eaten two thirds of the fudge it's one of us erm so like but and she you know I just sat there with it it must have been there like one afternoon for an extra hour or so so I just put erm that's a penalty and erm so like I just sat there and like I didn't really think about it I was filling in paper work bite of fudge fill in paper work bite of fudge and next thing I know I've eaten like a good chunk of this tub</u>
<u n="196" who="S0254">this is it is that like mindless eating isn't it</u>
<u n="197" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0254">that's why I got that app</u>
<u n="199" who="S0253">I'll just have one more I'll just have one</u>
<u n="200" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="201" who="S0253">I'll just have one more</u>
<u n="202" who="S0254">that's why I got that app cos I thought how much do I actually eat am I consuming more calories than I'm actually using cos I and especially it's like a desk job I'm just sat at a computer when I was on the Dowie I was moving around you know playing with the kids</u>
<u n="203" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="204" who="S0254">you're up you hardly ever sitting down</u>

<u n="440" who="S0254">I suppose it's make it's it's</u>
<u n="441" who="S0253">why why not say like and <trunc>le</trunc>let's be honest let's like like er you know I read I read <trunc>s</trunc><trunc>s</trunc> a study I don't <trunc>n</trunc> I think it was by by Lambert and Butler who said that smoking in your twenties</u>
<u n="442" who="S0254">oh is okay</u>
<u n="443" who="S0253">it's not that it's okay I mean it's obviously <trunc>b</trunc></u>
<u n="444" who="S0254">you can recover from it</u>
<u n="445" who="S0253">it's not as good as not <trunc>sm</trunc>smoking but smoking in your twenties is like sort of what's the word? negligible in terms of the damage caused</u>
<u n="446" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="447" who="S0253">than smoking like late er late in your thirties and you know but huh at the moment they why why is it why does it say anything? why do we regulate and say anything? and say okay well like or why do we have these initiatives like don't eat so much of this don't eat do so much of this? but then other things that should be sort of curbed I suppose there's just a blanket ban on cigarettes isn't there? it's er it's a blanket no no</u>
<u n="448" who="S0254">mm</u>
<u n="449" who="S0253">but then</u>
<u n="450" who="S0254">too much er of a grey area isn't it? and I suppose they're addictive</u>
<u n="451" who="S0253">no it's not it's <trunc>j</trunc> no it's</u>
<u n="452" who="S0254">they're addictive as well I suppose that's the thing isn't it? so the but er I don't know like sugar's probably more addictive than cigarettes but erm they they do deserve a goal I think Switzerland</u>
<u n="453" who="S0253">Switzerland have been brilliant</u>
<u n="454" who="S0254">erm <unclear/></u>
<u n="455" who="S0253">it's er it's not it's not that it's a grey area I mean the I think the facts are there it's the fact that like there's just been so much misinformation spread over the years</u>
<u n="456" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="457" who="S0253">and it's just even now</u>
<u n="458" who="S0254">but yeah I think it er it's because it's addictive isn't it?</u>
<u n="459" who="S0253">mm</u>
<u n="460" who="S0254">so they can say oh yeah smoke in you twenties that's fine it's like that would be fine if people then stopped but then by that point a lot of people are addicted and then it's more difficult for them</u>
<u n="461" who="S0253">yeah it's too hard to it's too hard to give up</u>
<u n="462" who="S0254">to stop so they carry on then and then they start to do damage</u>
<u n="463" who="S0253">it's</u>
<u n="464" who="S0254">so it's easier to say no don't start isn't it?</u>
<u n="465" who="S0253">it's interesting to see cigarette stuff do you remember the scare stories when it was like</u>
<u n="466" who="S0254">yeah there's things there calling for bans on them</u>
