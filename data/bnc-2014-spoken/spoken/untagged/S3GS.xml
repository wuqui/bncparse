<u n="2" who="S0632">it does seem that way</u>
<u n="3" who="S0631" trans="overlap">it's too complex</u>
<u n="4" who="S0632">I mean for all the benefits of erm of erm <pause dur="short"/> the benefits of I guess medical science and society and living in cities and the kind of way that we've made our world suit us for all those benefits there are huge disadvantages and people feeling isolated and stressed out in their jobs and</u>
<u n="5" who="S0631">yeah</u>
<u n="6" who="S0632">losing perspective of what life is really meant to be about</u>
<u n="7" who="S0631">and you know what you know like there's always the erm like they use in like science like animals and things and like making medicines and things my honest I don't I don't think there's an immediate need for all of those medicines if we were all not living in the lifestyles that we do</u>
<u n="8" who="S0632">mm</u>
<u n="9" who="S0631">like they're creating all these medicines for things that actually probably would be be prevented if it is wasn't for the world that we live in anyway</u>
<u n="10" who="S0635" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0632" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="12" who="S0631">erm <pause dur="short"/> for instance blood pressure medication</u>
<u n="13" who="S0632">mm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0635">there's various names for it cultured meat synthetic meat and shmeat</u>
<u n="15" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="19" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0635">and they've already made a burger by a Dutch team at the moment it's more expensive to make than conventionally produced meat but hopefully that will rebalance</u>
<u n="21" who="S0632">mm</u>
<u n="22" who="S0631">but then would the processes of making that</u>
<u n="23" who="S0635">apparently it's cultured never attached to a live animal</u>
<u n="24" who="S0631">okay but would there be someone who is kind of marginalising the processes like if they were gonna make that cheaper would then somebody a person</u>
<u n="25" who="S0635">mm</u>
<u n="26" who="S0631">be given unfair deal deals?</u>
<u n="27" who="S0635">erm</u>

<u n="29" who="S0631">oh yeah yeah and are they gospel?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0635">but you take muscle cells and apply a protein that promotes tissue growth</u>
<u n="31" who="S0631">okay you could do that from injured animals to be fair</u>
<u n="32" who="S0635">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0632">mm</u>
<u n="34" who="S0635">erm it would be theoretically possible to or to continue producing meat indefinitely without introducing new cells from a living organism</u>
<u n="35" who="S0631">but if you think about it you know the human body if you hurt yourself your skin will reform over it and you can attach skin to skin and like</u>
<u n="36" who="S0635" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0631">you know you can move</u>

<u n="50" who="S0632">and then there's a meat monster and it becomes sentient and we can't kill it because it's sentient now</u>
<u n="51" who="S0631">but what if it suffocated you like you just you were in the building and it got it covered the doorway and it got so big and then you got?</u>
<u n="52" who="S0632">that would be awful</u>
<u n="53" who="S0631">see someone is always gonna be injured and someone is always gonna be</u>
<u n="54" who="S0632">basically we can't win</u>
<u n="55" who="S0635">but it's</u>
<u n="56" who="S0631">no</u>

<u n="67" who="S0632">advocaat devil's advocaat to say oh you know no progress is made without marginalising or hurting something or someone but I know what you mean and we should always strive to not do that</u>
<u n="68" who="S0635" trans="overlap">I'm not saying it's good and we should strive not to do it but mm</u>
<u n="69" who="S0632" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0631">oh yeah it's like every argument I have to have at uni is it always boils down to equality or something and I'm like yes</u>
<u n="71" who="S0635" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0631">but it doesn't mean that just because it's not achievable you shouldn't strive to it or do that</u>
<u n="73" who="S0635" trans="overlap">mm yeah you should get as close as you can</u>
<u n="74" who="S0631" trans="overlap">you should get</u>
<u n="75" who="S0635">I feel like people give up and just do whatever</u>
<u n="76" who="S0631">yeah like like</u>
<u n="77" who="S0632" trans="overlap">it's like oh we'll never get there so let's not try</u>
<u n="78" who="S0631">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0635">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0631">definitely</u>
<u n="81" who="S0635">mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0631">and you should always attempt to understand more about what you're</u>
<u n="83" who="S0635" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="84" who="S0631">caring about and that's important</u>
<u n="85" who="S0632">that's true I do live in ignorance of a lot of things because to be honest the news stresses me out and I I go into a tailspin</u>
<u n="86" who="S0631">oh yeah the news is horrible</u>
<u n="87" who="S0635">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0631">erm but with like erm talking about schools and things is always the <trunc>e</trunc>equality opportunity</u>
<u n="89" who="S0632" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0631">debate and like that you can't cos you've got a classroom of thirty children say how do you give an actual equal education to those children? do you give them equal time? time how much time are you giving them?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0632">mm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0631">or do you go these are the the less erm able children and I'll give more time to them but then the children that are more able why are they not getting that?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0632">mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0631">why are they not being excelled as much? you know and</u>
<u n="95" who="S0632" trans="overlap">aha</u>
<u n="96" who="S0631">it <trunc>co</trunc> it comes in swings and roundabouts kind of like you can never win so you have to just do what the best you can do is erm and that's</u>
<u n="97" who="S0632" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0631">just I've lost my thread of thought but like but by like erm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0632">there isn't a simple answer</u>
<u n="100" who="S0631" trans="overlap">but by thinking about it and conjuring up those ideas and you understand that situation more <pause dur="short"/> and that's how you can sort of strive</u>
<u n="101" who="S0632" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0631">to do the best by getting it by understanding it</u>
<u n="103" who="S0632">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0631">and that is how I feel about lots of things</u>
<u n="105" who="S0632">that makes sense</u>
<u n="106" who="S0635">is it kosher in vitro meat shmeat?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0632">shmeat</u>
<u n="108" who="S0635">and that's a good question</u>
<u n="109" who="S0631">how would it not be?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0632">or how could it be?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0635">some Muslim scholars have stated that in in vitro meat would be allowed by Islamic law if the original cells and growth media were halal</u>
<u n="112" who="S0631">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0635">fascinating</u>
<u n="114" who="S0632"><unclear>okay perhaps I'm thinking</unclear></u>
<u n="115" who="S0631" trans="overlap">then you get all of these people though that are like</u>
<u n="116" who="S0632" trans="overlap">oh no all the all the</u>
<u n="117" who="S0631" trans="overlap">I'm not touching it cos it's halal</u>
<u n="118" who="S0632" trans="overlap">all the in vitro meat is halal <vocal desc="laugh"/> because it's made in the lab</u>
<u n="119" who="S0635" trans="overlap">but the best</u>
<u n="120" who="S0631" trans="overlap">because because like before er and no animal was killed it has to be alive</u>
<u n="121" who="S0635">that's</u>
<u n="122" who="S0632" trans="overlap">they kill them when they're alive</u>
<u n="123" who="S0635" trans="overlap">there was the best quote someone said on</u>
<u n="124" who="S0631" trans="overlap">was it Russell Brand?</u>
<u n="125" who="S0635">said it on Radio Four yeah or was it Russell Brand said it?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0631" trans="overlap">and he says the and he says</u>
<u n="127" who="S0632" trans="overlap">he did say that</u>
<u n="128" who="S0631" trans="overlap">he has a similar</u>
<u n="129" who="S0632">and it was quoted it was quoted from a newspaper that was like</u>
<u n="130" who="S0635" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0632">they they kill the animal they they like slit their</u>
<u n="132" who="S0631" trans="overlap">what do you want us to do give it <trunc>c</trunc>cuddle it to death <unclear/></u>
<u n="133" who="S0635" trans="overlap">the animal is alive while it's killed yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0632" trans="overlap">yeah and it was something like they slit their throats while they're completely alive and it's like well yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0631">well yes you're <unclear/> to understand the concept of life and death here</u>
<u n="136" who="S0635" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="138" who="S0635">you can like stun them</u>
<u n="139" who="S0632" trans="overlap">if <unclear/></u>
<u n="140" who="S0635">first but I think the stunning is as stressful as the killing thing isn't it?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0632" trans="overlap">yeah there's no evidence to say that stunning does anything</u>
<u n="142" who="S0631" trans="overlap">they're still alive and they will always come back around while they are bleeding to death</u>
<u n="143" who="S0632">I don't think being stunned is a nice experience to be honest</u>
<u n="144" who="S0631">no of course it's not and <trunc>h</trunc>how do you know that that doesn't actually still cause them pain? it just means they're more confused surely</u>
<u n="145" who="S0632">oh you electrocuted me in the head thanks thanks for that</u>
<u n="146" who="S0631">insult to injury yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0632">so someone was like I'm gonna kill you now do you wanna be electrocuted first or do you just want me to kill you?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0631">I'd just wanna be killed well it wouldn't make any difference</u>
<u n="149" who="S0632">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0631">cos if I was gonna get slaughtered and therefore essentially bleed to death I wouldn't want to come back around during it I I'd you might as well just do it and let's get get it done and I think hunted animals are killed straightaway aren't they generally?</u>
<u n="151" who="S0632">if you hunt</u>
<u n="152" who="S0635" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0632">something really well as in not with dogs to tear it apart</u>
<u n="154" who="S0631" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0632">you should shoot it in the head or the heart</u>
<u n="156" who="S0631" trans="overlap">yeah exactly so why are they not just doing that?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0635">it doesn't always work out though</u>
<u n="158" who="S0632">it doesn't always work out you sometimes shoot them in the wrong place but you aim</u>
<u n="159" who="S0631" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0635" trans="overlap">and then you have to spend days chasing after them to try and finish them off</u>
<u n="161" who="S0632" trans="overlap">that's horrible yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0635">before they went around with like an arrow in their back or something</u>
<u n="163" who="S0631"><unclear/> them then cos I I wouldn't be up to it I wouldn't do it right</u>
<u n="164" who="S0635">mm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0631">I'd be like <unclear>oh why get the</unclear></u>
<u n="166" who="S0632" trans="overlap">that's why I haven't shot anything</u>
<u n="167" who="S0631">no I wouldn't do it right</u>
<u n="168" who="S0632">cos that happened to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he shot a squirrel but he didn't do it right <pause dur="short"/> so they had to wait by the tree for hours my dad made him</u>
<u n="169" who="S0631">mm mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0632">he was like you have to finish that squirrel off he's like you gotta wait for it to come back out the tree so you can finish it</u>
<u n="171" who="S0631">mm mm</u>
<u n="172" who="S0632">it's just horrible</u>
<u n="173" who="S0631" trans="overlap">I remember my dad erm when he used to fit phone lines and things and like he'd have to do a lot of outside like work to put the phone lines in through the ground and everything he accidentally dug through erm <pause dur="short"/> some rabbit a rabbit's nest</u>

<u n="175" who="S0632" trans="overlap">oh</u>
