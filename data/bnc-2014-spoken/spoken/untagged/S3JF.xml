<u n="346" who="S0192">I contacted them today about transcribing cos somebody after somebody's going to listen to this afterwards and then turn it into a different alphabet I don't know if you know IPA? but if you look in a dictionary sometimes there'll be how you pronounce the word and you <trunc>lo</trunc></u>
<u n="347" who="S0190">yeah</u>
<u n="348" who="S0192">it's it's in a different alphabet</u>
<u n="349" who="S0190">yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0192">I can read and write that and I use it to teach like pronunciation because English orthography on English spelling doesn't line up with pronunciation</u>

<u n="352" who="S0192">you have a G and an H and it makes an F sound</u>
<u n="353" who="S0190">right</u>
<u n="354" who="S0192">so I teach with this different alphabet and they're going to be paying other freelancers to listen to these and type them up in this phonetic alphabet so I contacted her today and said look maybe I'm not quite qualified yet but maybe you know once I'm further headlong into my course maybe if I I have quite an interest in phonology can I get involved with with transcribing?</u>
<u n="355" who="S0190">oh right</u>
<u n="356" who="S0192">I wonder if they how much they pay for that if they pay an hour just to transcribe cos transcribing it would be difficult I think sitting down for each hour</u>
<u n="357" who="S0190">yeah</u>
<u n="358" who="S0192">so you'll be you will all be cemented in history</u>

<u n="563" who="S0227">this is what erm galvanises</u>
<u n="564" who="S0190">and the only reason I've got it on for was because I thought the erm jackpot was fifteen and a half thousand pounds and I just wanted to see it's not very often it gets up that high but it must be something else</u>
<u n="565" who="S0192">sorry you want to turn it up? I can stop this</u>

<u n="573" who="S0227">er no we missed it erm just came to the end erm yes I think it's it's experiences like that that galvanise erm I treat <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> more <trunc>th</trunc> as a brother than my own <trunc>bro</trunc> half-brother</u>
<u n="574" who="S0192">because you went through more with him</u>
<u n="575" who="S0227">because I grew up with him so and I've always kind of continued to see him you know there hasn't there's probably not been hardly erm there's probably only been about three three years in the last since sixty-nine</u>
<u n="576" who="S0190">is that alright?</u>

<u n="581" who="S0227">erm so yeah so I don't think your mum does it consciously it's probably but like you said things have to be natural if they you you can't make round pegs go into square holes there's you know but I think erm there will be more of a relationship between him and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> because they have lived sometime together there was like with my own half-brother it is my blood but we don't have a common erm upbringing we can talk about the same father but that's about it really you know but I accept him and there is that bond because if someone walks in the room and they're looking for Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> me and him will turn our heads when if that was the situation in say ten years' time <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will not turn his head</u>
<u n="582" who="S0192">no I'm I'm not gonna know him obviously erm I can't see myself living close enough even if I did live in England I still wouldn't see him very much</u>

<u n="1175" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1176" who="S0192">sometimes we it was so seasonal that we could buy a kilo of potatoes for fifty P or a kilo of potatoes for four or five pounds it was like</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0192">really changed</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0227">I I once picked up a carrot one I mean it was a big carrot but it was like three pounds for one carrot</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0192">what in in</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0227">in Korea</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0192">if it's out of season it just like shoots but the problem is it can spike from week to week it just like really jumps on us one week you go in and celery's a pound for a bunch the next week it's three or four pound for a bunch</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0227">yeah so there's no <trunc>con</trunc></u>
<u n="1184" who="S0190">do they grow anything like this in the actual country? or is it all imported?</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0192">they that's the thing the the prices my</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0227">they grow everything</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0192">they grow a lot they grow a lot of what they can but there's no way that they're growing as much as they say they're growing the amount of the amount that they eat I don't see where all these farmers are coming from they eat so much pork and I've never seen a pig in the entire country so they must import that from China but they do have farms everywhere they have a lot smaller farms it's not like one person farms everything it's like wherever there's a free spot of land the local people are farming something but it's it's kind of the same crops they do a lot of pumpkin a lot of courgette a lot of chillies and green onion all that kind of stuff but they don't vary on the local farming they don't really vary on what they cook it's just kind of there for their food</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0190">right</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0192">so things like broccoli and cauliflower they are farmed there but not as commonly so they're more expensive and they're more <unclear/></u>
<u n="1190" who="S0227">the seasons</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0192"><foreign lang="kor">subak</foreign> watermelon you can buy humongous I'm not even joking are about that big they're about two pound two pound fifty in the height of the summer but then off season it'll be about twenty pounds for like one thing</u>

<u n="1197" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0192">and freeze it so then I can use it later I have to do that with coriander as well cos it's really hard to come back</u>

<u n="1206" who="S0192">yeah yeah these are really expensive</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0227">hence that's why</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0192">why I might steal some</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0227">I crop them</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0192">you go in Sainsbury's there's about four leaves in for about ten pound</u>

<u n="1215" who="S0192" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah well that's what I've been using I've been using dried ones</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0227">so you'll have fresh and freeze them straight away</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0192">the only lemongrass I've had was dried as well</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0227">yeah freeze it straight away</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0192">freeze the <trunc>dry</trunc> the fresh ones</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0227">the ones that I bring down with me on that day froze freeze that</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0192">but you don't have any tamarind?</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0227">no I got</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0192">galangal?</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0227">no I I have used galangal but galangal's like ginger that's palm trees</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0192">yeah it is the same as ginger</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0192">I told that to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he said he wasn't cooking these recipes because</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0190"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> doesn't like stuff that's too sweet so I don't use <trunc>t</trunc> I haven't used tamarind myself but obviously if you made dish she would she would she would eat it</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0192">the curry that I want to cook is erm probably my favourite curry ever</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0227">is it massaman?</u>
<u n="1231" who="S0192">in no no it's an Indonesian curry called a rendang and you take I get like a kilo of beef steak I really tenderise it and then cook it really high erm take that off and then the sauce is really easy to make but it's the same as any kind of other green curry you've got your onions red chillies in this one erm ginger or galangal kaffir lime leaves lemon grass tamarind it does have so it's a bit sweeter but the spices that go into it is it has a lot of cinnamon in it has a lot of cardamom in it which gives it a real lemon kick</u>
<u n="1232" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0192">and it has quite a bit of clove in it as well</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0192">erm but you normally for me clove is really really strong</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0227">no nuts</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0192">no it doesn't have any nuts</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0227">no cos I was going to say <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> doesn't like nuts in <unclear/> you don't like nut do ya?</u>
<u n="1239" who="S0192">massaman no not the rendang</u>
<u n="1240" who="S0190">I like nuts but don't like I don't like the the peanut curries</u>
<u n="1241" who="S0192">no and then you just add a lot of coconut cream cook it really really low for about four hours so all of the sauce goes away until there's just a thick dark browny red paste that's on it and right at the end you turn it up really high and caramelise the the beef in its own fat and it's so good</u>
<u n="1242" who="S0227">sounds nice</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0192">it's so flavoursome it's like way more flavoursome than almost every other curry I've ever had but it is sweet the cinnamon and the tamarind does make it kind of sweet</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0227">have you got two room</u>
<u n="1245" who="S0192">it's countered by the clove though</u>
<u n="1246" who="S0227">two bedrooms in your house</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0192">no one seven hundred and fifty pound a month one room</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0227">oh right</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0192">it's quite spacious though everywhere we were looking</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0190">the rooms look quite big on the pictures you sent</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0192">oh did you see the photos yeah?</u>
<u n="1252" who="S0190">yeah</u>
<u n="1253" who="S0192">it won't be amazing but it was really problematic trying to find a flat from out there and I'm glad we did it in advance</u>
<u n="1254" who="S0227" trans="overlap">from from the other side of the from the other side of the world yeah</u>
<u n="1255" who="S0192">yeah nobody trusted us local landlords would lead us along and they'd be like no I want someone local and I'm like telling them I've got the money I can give you the money right now</u>
<u n="1256" who="S0227">and and and we're teachers you know did you go to school</u>
<u n="1257" who="S0192">they basically just ignored us and just were like you're foreign I don't trust you effectively and then same through the letting agency they didn't really trust us either so we had to have so much paperwork behind us and like it was a real stress getting everything sent over and</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0192">I had to get my bosses involved in Korea and you know they tell you they want erm your bill statements to prove that I'd been living in this residence in Korea and I'm telling them I don't pay for bills it's all included in my thing</u>
<u n="1260" who="S0227">it's all yeah</u>
<u n="1261" who="S0192">okay well we want bank statements from your bank I don't get bank statements in Korea we don't have them</u>
<u n="1262" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="1263" who="S0192">so having to go into the bank and ask for special forms and</u>
<u n="1264" who="S0227">yes yeah</u>
<u n="1265" who="S0192">like scanning and all this</u>
<u n="1266" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1267" who="S0192">it went on and on and on and then they failed us so we sent them all this information I sent them the details of how much savings I had which was easily enough for the whole year</u>
<u n="1268" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1269" who="S0192">and they failed us but they didn't tell us they failed us and then what really annoyed me is this third party company this this agency that reference checked us was not allowed to tell us the result they could only tell the agency and the agency were like on holiday so they wouldn't tell me what the result were and I'm thinking I paid you I gave you a lot of my personal and sensitive information</u>
<u n="1270" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1271" who="S0192">and and you're telling me that you can't you're not at liberty to give my information so if the reason they do it is because the letting agency can just tell you what they want to tell you so even if this company passes me they can still request that I get guarantors and all these kind of things</u>
<u n="1272" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1273" who="S0192">so they can still fail me so they do that system so it's at their discretion to</u>
<u n="1274" who="S0190">I suppose though it's like everything isn't it? all these like erm health and safety and all that it's all done because people have messed people around</u>
<u n="1275" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1276" who="S0190">and they've got to find a way to cover it</u>
<u n="1277" who="S0192">I think it's done as well to make more jobs we we need more there's more and more people we need more and more jobs so you get inspectors inspecting inspectors doing something else cos you need to make the jobs so it keeps being more and more third middle men</u>
<u n="1278" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1279" who="S0192">cos you need to put somebody in the middle to make another job</u>
<u n="1280" who="S0190" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1281" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1282" who="S0190">yeah somebody you can blame</u>
<u n="1283" who="S0192">so</u>
<u n="1284" who="S0227">another middle man <unclear/> middle men everywhere they make them you'll sit here?</u>
<u n="1285" who="S0192">yeah I'll sit there</u>
<u n="1286" who="S0192">so I found out why they erm failed me and my savings hadn't been in my bank account for long enough on the the thing is I sent them savings from like months ago and I had the money in my account then but the most recent one I had nothing in my account really and then the money appeared in my account only a few days before now if they told me this before failing me I'd have rectified the problem I'd have been like yeah I'll send you you know I'll tell you why but actually I'd just come back from Cambodia and in Cambodia I don't keep all my savings in the bank account I'm using because that would be dangerous if somebody takes my bank card empties my account</u>
<u n="1287" who="S0227">yes yes yes</u>
<u n="1288" who="S0192">so I move it to my own digital account</u>
<u n="1289" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1290" who="S0192">and then when I got home I move it back in again</u>
<u n="1291" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1292" who="S0192">so I explained that to them and I sent them copies of the digital account I moved it into so we got passed in the end</u>
<u n="1293" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0192">it was just a lot of effort it went on for about two weeks of solidly calling them and you know</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0227">bit of a palaver yeah</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0192">it was a real palaver I thought it would be easy I thought if I come home with enough money to pay for my rent twice out you'd think you'd think they'd just be like</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah you think money talks you think money talks</u>
<u n="1298" who="S0190" trans="overlap">you're a student</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah go for it but no they just went no so we managed to get around I didn't want dad to have to go through the hassle of a guarantor so we ended up paying I've paid them eight months in advance</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0227">yeah although <trunc>that</trunc><trunc>the</trunc>that was an available with this so yeah I did say I'd do that</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0192">it was just and for us I didn't want another week of stress thinking is dad going to be passed is this going to go through</u>
<u n="1302" who="S0190">yeah is your dad going to be passed yeah dodgy</u>
<u n="1303" who="S0192">I didn't want him to go through the same rigmarole that we just had to go through so</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0227">neither do I</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0192">well like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s parents were really happy to do it but we were genuinely concerned that they might fail <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s dad is retired and never had earned very much</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0192">so his pension wasn't particularly high and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s mum works part time</u>
<u n="1308" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1309" who="S0192">so</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0190">and the oven's hot don't touch the plates alright</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0192">I was not convinced that I wasn't convinced <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s parents were gonna pass and then if we fail our own reference and they fail a reference we're definitely not going to get it</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0190" trans="overlap">I was gonna say you don't get no</u>
<u n="1313" who="S0227"><unclear/> right</u>

<u n="1320" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1321" who="S0227">If I start talking the <trunc>meth</trunc> the methodology gets a bit erm it will all go in I don't hence the chocolate I forgot the chocolate</u>

<u n="2032" who="S0190">it was it's been quite good</u>
<u n="2033" who="S0227">it's very erm not for us er because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s illness erm she was cold all the time so I I had the heating on all the time</u>

<u n="2038" who="S0192">oh wow</u>
<u n="2039" who="S0227">it was a very mild winter erm but she was cold all the time so my heating bills erm didn't reflect where normally because I have a erm a spreadsheet erm macro driven it erm I every month at the end of the month I take the gas reading and the electricity reading bit sad but I know how much I'm spending and I can see over the year what the temperature was like so I can tell you was it warmer last June than it was this June cos I'll go and have a look at the gas and I'll have a look at the electricity but the winter</u>
<u n="2040" who="S0192">or are you more sensitive to it</u>
<u n="2041" who="S0227">yeah the winter will give me more of a a a false reading cos like I said <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was erm cold all the time</u>
<u n="2042" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2043" who="S0227">so you erm I had the heating on from September er onwards you know it it was kicking in all the time keep it warm</u>

<u n="2045" who="S0227">that that's going to be a challenge</u>
<u n="2046" who="S0192">well I mean heating wise we survived in Korea with no heating in winters that were much colder than here consistently minus ten</u>
<u n="2047" who="S0227">dry or <trunc>co</trunc> or damp cold?</u>
<u n="2048" who="S0192">erm it was dry cold</u>
<u n="2049" who="S0227">huge difference</u>
<u n="2050" who="S0192">there is a big difference but two degrees three degrees is a big different to minus ten</u>
<u n="2051" who="S0227">oh yeah</u>
<u n="2052" who="S0192">and when I got to erm</u>
<u n="2053" who="S0227">but you were being heated by in a you were in a unit weren't you like <trunc>f</trunc> and the heat was coming <trunc>f</trunc> probably from below you</u>
<u n="2054" who="S0192">trust me I could see my breath in my apartment</u>
<u n="2055" who="S0227">oh god lord</u>

<u n="2057" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="2058" who="S0192">but we're still young we can do that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="2059" who="S0227">you didn't have to pay for this stuff though did you?</u>
<u n="2060" who="S0192">no I did in the year prior only the last year</u>
<u n="2061" who="S0227">oh right</u>
<u n="2062" who="S0192">actually the last year was ridiculous the winter was too hot for me I quite like look forward to being cooler in winter so I can you know have a duvet snuggle up get a leg out that kind of stuff but they kept the heating on throughout the whole winter</u>
<u n="2063" who="S0227">oh right</u>
<u n="2064" who="S0192">and <trunc>w</trunc> I couldn't control it</u>
