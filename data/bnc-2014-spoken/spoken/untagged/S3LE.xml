<u n="871" who="S0342" trans="overlap">too boring</u>
<u n="872" who="S0336">yeah and she really struggled to deal with that and it was really weird and like like I said there was periods where I knew she was really low but there's nothing you can do about it except be there when she wants you to talk to her</u>
<u n="873" who="S0342" trans="overlap">I know but you can you can feel that way but just not for a prolonged period of time like hers do you know what I mean?</u>

<u n="880" who="S0336">but it was just <trunc>s</trunc> and it was just <trunc>s</trunc> to a such extreme level like everybody's been er most people have been a little bit depressed or a little bit sad or a little bit just like contemplative and thinking like oh this isn't what I was expecting</u>
<u n="881" who="S0342">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="882" who="S0336">but like no like but hers were just so like I mean when she was low she was like manic depressive low like she was she was hurting herself and just getting herself into really bad situations and then like I mean and she was like kicking off at her parents and she was being <trunc>rea</trunc> like she had just so many destructive behaviours like she did a couple er well actually not that long ago about this time last year she started a blog <pause dur="short"/> and like no word of <trunc>l</trunc>lie like it became like she was trying so hard to be like kind of outrageous and to grab people's attention but like what she was effectively doing was just like outing a load of people a load of people that were meant to have been her friends like she was just like naming and shaming them on this blog and I mean it was the talk of <anon type="place"/> like she really did get everybody's attention because these stories were just like outrageous like like I would not have let you read them because like like the stuff that she got up to and like that she'd openly written on this blog and then like but like she was <trunc>ta</trunc> she also went through a phase and I I I don't wanna say that it's not true because I don't know but she went through a phase of claiming that her ex-boyfriend used to beat her</u>
<u n="883" who="S0342">right what and she was writing about it?</u>
<u n="884" who="S0336">and she was writing about it yeah for like public kind of consumption but like everybody who was around her at the time that she was claiming this happened basically turned round and said like like I'd be really sad if it was true I just don't see how it could be because you know like he like he's just A he wasn't that kind of person and B she had so many people who were around her at that phase of her life that they would have noticed</u>
<u n="885" who="S0342">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="886" who="S0336">and so like all she was doing is like trying to be like it was defamation of character like so he ended up having to call her parents threatening to call the police actually if basically cos she was just the kind of stuff she was saying it was so</u>
<u n="887" who="S0342" trans="overlap">so bad so yeah</u>
<u n="888" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah it was terrible and so her parents kicked off but like you know her parents keep shipping her off to like various family members for like weeks at a time and it's just they clearly as a family just don't know how to</u>

<u n="3109" who="S0337" trans="overlap">drive straight in</u>
<u n="3110" who="S0336" trans="overlap">even from <anon type="place"/> like I used to I used to leave my house at half past eight and I'd be at my desk for nine but if I tried to leave at eight I'd still be in there at like ten to nine</u>
<u n="3111" who="S0343">yeah</u>
<u n="3112" who="S0337" trans="overlap">yeah it's so much <unclear>longer</unclear></u>
<u n="3113" who="S0336" trans="overlap">it's so stupid so I just stopped doing it the more the more chance you took with it the better off you tended to be and even even now I've found that the case like more often than not like if I leave sometime between half past eight and nine o'clock normally I would get there before ten but it only takes an accident</u>
<u n="3114" who="S0343">and that's it you're knackered</u>
<u n="3115" who="S0337">mm</u>
<u n="3116" who="S0343" trans="overlap">that's the the A14 is a lousy road you know</u>

<u n="3122" who="S0343" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3123" who="S0337">like it it was constant like <trunc>ev</trunc> like there wasn't a break in the traffic and that's at seven in the morning</u>
<u n="3124" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="3125" who="S0337" trans="overlap">it's like</u>
<u n="3126" who="S0336">it is pretty depressing to be honest</u>
<u n="3127" who="S0337">and it'll be like that until nine</u>
<u n="3128" who="S0336">yeah <vocal desc="sigh"/> it is daft <pause dur="short"/> but like I literally <trunc>li</trunc> I honestly can't believe you know like with all these all the developments they've made with satnavs and all that kind of stuff like traffic announcements just haven't caught up like you you you don't know about an accident until you're already in the traffic</u>
<u n="3129" who="S0343" trans="overlap">almost on top of it yeah</u>
<u n="3130" who="S0337">yeah</u>
<u n="3131" who="S0336">and then it's too late to do anything like I mean the journey I take I don't really have a lot of room for like detours anyway</u>
<u n="3132" who="S0337" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3133" who="S0336">so like when you hit the traffic it's not like I go oh I can come off at this turning it's fine like I need to take that road like there's no there's no way round it but it is frustrating when like especially like if I've <trunc>sor</trunc> on on an occasion like especially like coming in and out of the city centre there's definitely ways in an out I I know I know three different ways to get into <anon type="place"/> and out of <anon type="place"/> so if I knew that one one way was blocked then I'd take the other but you there's just no way of knowing until you've actually got into then it's just blocked</u>
<u n="3134" who="S0343" trans="overlap">then you wish you hadn't started it yeah</u>
<u n="3135" who="S0336">like it's so frustrating <pause dur="short"/> the worst it's the worst it's taken me is two it's taken me two and a half and a half hours to get to work before and annoyingly it happened on the same day I had a really shit journey into work so left at half eight got in at eleven and then they said oh don't worry about working your time back cos that's the thing then you owe them time you're already having a fucking shit and they're like oh you owe us time great so I got in at eleven and they were like oh don't worry about paying back your time today otherwise it's just gonna be a really long day like head off as normal so then I head off I <trunc>li</trunc> left at half five I think and it took me two hours to get home as well eleven hour day and I only had like six hours at work great</u>
<u n="3136" who="S0343">rubbish</u>

<u n="3157" who="S0337" trans="overlap">in London</u>
<u n="3158" who="S0336">like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s dad yeah <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s dad used to travel down towards London like granted he used to work from home two days a week but he used to do it three <trunc>da</trunc> three times a week like er he he was working over like Coventry way at some point as well like and he was leaving at god knows like but he would be up and gone before you're even up in the morning and then he wouldn't get in till like a couple of hours after you in the evening and I'm just thinking like</u>
<u n="3159" who="S0337">my dad did</u>
<u n="3160" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="3161" who="S0337"><anon type="place"/> to <anon type="place"/> to <anon type="place"/> for about thirty years and a few of those years he he'd have to work out of London of like a year on end and he'd drive to <anon type="place"/> park up train down to London train back drive back to <anon type="place"/> it's just</u>
<u n="3162" who="S0336" trans="overlap">that's <trunc>sh</trunc></u>
<u n="3163" who="S0337">it isn't it isn't it's not a lifestyle</u>
<u n="3164" who="S0336">no</u>
<u n="3165" who="S0337">I think but people do it don't they? it's crazy</u>
<u n="3166" who="S0343">I think I did it for three months but I used to I used to I was working over at <anon type="place"/> way so it wouldn't have been</u>
<u n="3167" who="S0337" trans="overlap">one one road</u>
<u n="3168" who="S0343">so living in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="3169" who="S0337">mm</u>
<u n="3170" who="S0343">oh no I you didn't you'd go along the A47 and you used to go through erm <anon type="place"/> used to go that way</u>
<u n="3171" who="S0337">okay</u>
<u n="3172" who="S0343">so I used to cut a chunk I <trunc>us</trunc> I used to miss <anon type="place"/> and</u>
<u n="3173" who="S0337" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3174" who="S0343">but I used to leave at half six and get into work at five to eight and then leave at quarter to five and get in for about quarter past half past six long gone days though</u>
<u n="3175" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="3176" who="S0343">and it was seventy <pause dur="short"/> seventy-two miles or something so when you think I was I was doing seventy-two mile in an hour and a half</u>
<u n="3177" who="S0337">mm yeah</u>
<u n="3178" who="S0343">and you're taking longer than that to do half that</u>
<u n="3179" who="S0337">yeah</u>
<u n="3180" who="S0343">half that distance</u>
<u n="3181" who="S0336">that's what that's the frustrating thing and that's what I find <pause dur="short"/> find hard to explain to people at work like it's not the distance it's just how hard that journey is like and like I've tried to explain to my manager before like it's really stressful leaving your house and honestly not knowing what time you're gonna get into work like you know after you've been at if if after you've been in a job for nine months you normally have a gauge of how long it takes you to get to and from work but I've not got a fucking chance</u>
<u n="3182" who="S0337">got no routine I guess</u>
<u n="3183" who="S0336" trans="overlap">no no chance I've like</u>
<u n="3184" who="S0343" trans="overlap">it it is one of the worst roads in the country</u>
<u n="3185" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3186" who="S0343" trans="overlap">I think the A14</u>
<u n="3187" who="S0336">you just can't do anything about it it's so annoying and it's hard cos I think like most people who commute do it for like I don't know more money or you know they have more responsibility and like mine's still very much an entry level job which means like the motivation isn't quite there to go all that way</u>
<u n="3188" who="S0337">if you've not gone somewhere to get there</u>
<u n="3189" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="3190" who="S0337">so you've gone there to get somewhere <pause dur="short"/> so to to put that on top of you it's just not it's not worth it really</u>
<u n="3191" who="S0336">stress it it's just it's like you know like when you're having those like internal monologues when you're stuck in the traffic? at least if you if you thought like if I thought I was going to work and it <trunc>wa</trunc> like the work was really important and like you know I was going in for meetings and I was doing this and like I had a purpose for getting to <anon type="place"/> then you'd kind of be able to justify all the shit but I'm sat there in the traffic thinking like I don't think it really matters if I get to work today like <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3192" who="S0343"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3193" who="S0336">I haven't got any meetings I haven't got anyone that I need to see I haven't got anything that needs doing like urgently</u>
<u n="3194" who="S0337" trans="overlap">nothing kicking off yeah</u>
<u n="3195" who="S0336" trans="overlap">nothing's kicking off yeah it's really weird</u>
<u n="3196" who="S0343">it will</u>
<u n="3197" who="S0337">yeah</u>
<u n="3198" who="S0336">I hope so</u>
<u n="3199" who="S0343" trans="overlap">it it will as the you know as you get the timing</u>
<u n="3200" who="S0336"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="3201" who="S0343">it's just a shame you've got that journey</u>
<u n="3202" who="S0337">yeah</u>
<u n="3203" who="S0343">so is the train is a train not an option?</u>
<u n="3204" who="S0336">it's so expensive</u>
<u n="3205" who="S0343">is it?</u>
<u n="3206" who="S0336" trans="overlap">just yeah it's like two hundred and eighty pound a month it's just</u>
<u n="3207" who="S0337" trans="overlap">we <trunc>loo</trunc> yeah we looked at selling your car but that wouldn't last long would it? the money we'd get</u>
<u n="3208" who="S0336">the money so say</u>
<u n="3209" who="S0337" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3210" who="S0336" trans="overlap">well I got nine hundred pounds for my car so it would have <trunc>giv</trunc> it would have bought me three months' train travel <pause dur="short"/> and then I'd have had two hundred and eighty pound going out of my account like even before I switched my car it was only costing me two hundred a month in petrol <pause dur="short"/> and with my new car I'm expecting those costs to like nearly half I should be paying about a hundred and twenty pound a month I think in fuel</u>
<u n="3211" who="S0343">good</u>
<u n="3212" who="S0336">so it's like less than half what the train would cost me</u>
<u n="3213" who="S0343" trans="overlap">and it would be a nicer journey</u>
<u n="3214" who="S0337">yeah well</u>
<u n="3215" who="S0336" trans="overlap">so it's just</u>
<u n="3216" who="S0337"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3217" who="S0336">well yeah but it's it's like the thing is</u>
<u n="3218" who="S0343" trans="overlap">no more comfortable in the car</u>
<u n="3219" who="S0337" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3220" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3221" who="S0337">yeah</u>
<u n="3222" who="S0336">it is and like the problem being is that trains the trains from <anon type="place"/> to <anon type="place"/> aren't actually that regular they're <trunc>o</trunc>one every hour so like in terms of flexibility of working hours it's really really hard because I <trunc>ev</trunc> the <trunc>o</trunc> there's only two trains I could get in the morning quarter past seven or quarter past eight</u>
<u n="3223" who="S0343">right</u>
<u n="3224" who="S0337">and they're full</u>
<u n="3225" who="S0336">and they're full and the only <trunc>tr</trunc></u>
<u n="3226" who="S0337" trans="overlap">and they take</u>
<u n="3227" who="S0336">the only trains I can get home are <trunc>f</trunc>five or six o'clock</u>
<u n="3228" who="S0337">and they take a while as well don't they?</u>
<u n="3229" who="S0336">it's shit</u>
<u n="3230" who="S0337" trans="overlap">they take a while and they cost a lot and they're full and you're stuck to doing those times so you're stuck doing a terrible car journey that could go like really bad but it's cheaper you don't have to deal with like the limits in time but you have to deal with like the crappy roads but you get get the <trunc>bu</trunc>but the train you'd spend a lot more</u>
<u n="3231" who="S0343">spend a lot more money</u>
<u n="3232" who="S0337" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3233" who="S0343">probably have to stand up</u>

<u n="3235" who="S0343" trans="overlap">all the way</u>
<u n="3236" who="S0336">well this is the thing cos as soon as you've got a season ticket you don't get a seat you only get a seat if you like pre-book so if you've bought like advanced tickets season ticket holders don't aren't ever guaranteed a seat so</u>
<u n="3237" who="S0343">so you could end up standing all the way standing all the way to <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="3238" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="3239" who="S0337">for an hour</u>
