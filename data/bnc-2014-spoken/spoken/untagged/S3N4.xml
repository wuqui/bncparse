<u n="49" who="S0653" trans="overlap">now I want you eat the pancetta cos you like bacon and that's just Italian <pause dur="short"/> bacon</u>
<event desc="sound of kissing lips"/>
<u n="50" who="S0655">Jamaican Italian pig</u>
<u n="51" who="S0653">not Jamaican no</u>
<u n="52" who="S0655">Jamaican bacon</u>
<u n="53" who="S0653">Jamaican bacon? <pause dur="short"/> mm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> don't eat too quickly</u>
<u n="54" who="S0655">you'll get hiccups like I do <pause dur="short"/> sometimes I just randomly get hiccups <pause dur="short"/> I wonder why you get hiccups from just</u>
<u n="55" who="S0652" trans="overlap">this is something <trunc>comp</trunc> sorry sorry sorry sorry</u>
<u n="56" who="S0655" trans="overlap">I wonder why you don't get hiccups for breathing too heavily cos if you hold your breath they go away</u>
<u n="57" who="S0653">a spasm in the diaphragm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0655">okay <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0652" trans="overlap">and you use your diaphragm to breathe so when you hold your breath you basically stop using your diaphragm so your diaphragm has time to settle down and stop spasming</u>
<u n="60" who="S0653" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0652">that's what happens</u>
<u n="62" who="S0655">okay but <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> continue</u>
<u n="63" who="S0652" trans="overlap">and the reason it's spasming is just because it's not getting enough blood to it therefore if you stop it from working the blood flow can then go into it</u>
<u n="64" who="S0655">and then you die</u>
<u n="65" who="S0652">mm</u>
<u n="66" who="S0653">and then you die? no</u>
<u n="67" who="S0655">well you faint</u>
<u n="68" who="S0653">no</u>
<u n="69" who="S0654">if you hold your breath too long you do faint</u>
<u n="70" who="S0653">it's pretty much impossible to hold your breath</u>
<u n="71" who="S0652">until you faint</u>
<u n="72" who="S0653">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0655">yeah but you can</u>
<u n="74" who="S0653">but if you fainted your <trunc>brolly</trunc> body would then start breathing again</u>
<u n="75" who="S0655">yeah true unless you had Sellotape around your nose and your mouth <pause dur="short"/> then you'd die</u>
<u n="76" who="S0652" trans="overlap">that's called suffocating that</u>
<u n="77" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0655">yeah but you'd still die</u>
<u n="79" who="S0652" trans="overlap">that that's completely different</u>
<u n="80" who="S0655">yeah you'd die</u>
<u n="81" who="S0653">mm <pause dur="short"/> your body would still breathe though</u>
<u n="82" who="S0655">what? through <trunc>t</trunc> Sellotape?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0653">no but it would still er automatically try and take those breaths in</u>
<u n="84" who="S0654">and out</u>
<u n="85" who="S0653">cos that's what happens when people drown</u>
<u n="86" who="S0652">mm they start breathing underwater</u>
<u n="87" who="S0653">must be horrible mustn't it?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0652">yeah well apparently it's very a very peaceful death</u>
<u n="89" who="S0653">it can't be cos when you breathe in all the water will come into your lungs and</u>
<u n="90" who="S0652">yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0653">that pressure must feel horrible</u>
<u n="92" who="S0652">and it's the whole motion of breathing in and out</u>
<u n="93" who="S0653">but your <trunc>bo</trunc>body would be trying to get it out wouldn't it? and you'd be coughing and you'd be taking the water in I think it'd be very painful</u>
<u n="94" who="S0652" trans="overlap">it's cos the oxygen because the oxygen levels are already quite low you're already kind of sleepy</u>
<u n="95" who="S0653"><vocal desc="misc"/> I'd like to see that research <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0655">that's why it's so although how can sharks breathe?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0653">I don't know they've got gills haven't they?</u>
<u n="98" who="S0655">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0652">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0655">do gills like let in all the oxygen? and then <trunc>s</trunc> not the water?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0652">well there's oxygen in the water</u>
<u n="103" who="S0655">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0652">and what gills do <pause dur="short"/> they absorb the oxygen out of the water</u>
<u n="105" who="S0655"><unclear>oh right yeah but</unclear></u>
<u n="106" who="S0652">so they flow through and out of the gills so it goes is it through the mouth and out the gills?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0653">I dunno so I don't know if they kind of breathe or not I dunno</u>
<u n="108" who="S0655"><unclear>well</unclear> sharks</u>
<u n="109" who="S0653">but whales need to come up for air don't they?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0652">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0655">yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0655">and <trunc>d</trunc></u>
<u n="114" who="S0653">which seems a bit ridiculous</u>
<u n="115" who="S0655" trans="overlap">so do dolphins</u>
<u n="116" who="S0653">no they I know they can hold it for ages but it just seems like a really</u>
<u n="117" who="S0652" trans="overlap"><unclear>no</unclear> hours and hours they can hold it <unclear>for</unclear></u>
<u n="118" who="S0653">I know but why hasn't it evolved so they just can be under the water the whole time? just seems a completely unnecessary thing</u>
<u n="119" who="S0652" trans="overlap">cos they're mammals</u>
<u n="120" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0655">it would take a lot of evolving <pause dur="short"/> maybe they are evolving</u>
<u n="122" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="123" who="S0652">but when you're that big</u>
<u n="124" who="S0655" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0652">you don't <trunc>ha</trunc> really have a a natural predator do you?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0653">apart from us</u>
<u n="127" who="S0652">in the wild</u>
<u n="128" who="S0653">no but I'm just saying</u>
<u n="129" who="S0655">no they're our predators</u>
<u n="130" who="S0653">they're too big to be out of the water oh there were some <trunc>w</trunc>whales washed up this week weren't there?</u>
<u n="131" who="S0655" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="132" who="S0653">very sad</u>
<u n="133" who="S0652" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="134" who="S0653">very sad so they can't exist outside of the water so it seems</u>
<u n="135" who="S0652">no</u>
<u n="136" who="S0653">weird that they have that connection outside of the water still</u>
<u n="137" who="S0652">but the only reason that they can't survive out of the water is because their body weight is so huge</u>
<u n="138" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="139" who="S0652">the pressure is too much on their internal organs and that's why they die</u>
<u n="140" who="S0653">I know <pause dur="short"/> but they used to walk</u>
<u n="141" who="S0652">did they?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0653">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0652">what were they?</u>

<u n="145" who="S0652">mm</u>
<u n="146" who="S0653">they were whales but they could they could walk when you look at the whale have you erm? I've told you this before in the Natural History Museum or in fact in the Zoology Museum in <anon type="place"/> if you look at a skeleton of a whale <pause dur="short"/> embedded in the tale are these kind of two flipper-like things which are <trunc>f</trunc> in the flesh they're not used and they are the throwback to when they had legs <pause dur="short"/> it's the same for dolphins</u>
<u n="147" who="S0652">well maybe</u>
<u n="148" who="S0653">but they were much smaller then</u>
<u n="149" who="S0652">thousands of years ago they used to escape dinosaurs <pause dur="short"/> by running into the water</u>

<u n="154" who="S0652">mm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0653">I don't think they were around</u>
