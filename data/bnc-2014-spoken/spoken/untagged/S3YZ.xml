<u n="78" who="S0086">yeah <pause dur="short"/> or just when you need them <pause dur="short"/> because they're probably always going to be there just like your adult teeth are there and they come down when your baby teeth go and then when they go your next row come down</u>

<u n="150" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0046">receipts are the way forward</u>
<u n="152" who="S0041">I usually leave mine though <pause dur="short"/> I'm rubbish <pause dur="short"/> I take it off her and I <trunc>ne</trunc> I never know where I've put it</u>
<u n="153" who="S0086">yeah I put it in a safe place but then if they stop me and then you've got bags of stuff and you're trying to find your receipt yeah <pause dur="short"/> you'd be really annoyed</u>
<u n="154" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0046">bu then there's other questions that they can ask as well <pause dur="short"/> how much did you pay for it? And what till did you use?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0046">and then they can just search the computer <pause dur="short"/> and find out</u>

<u n="164" who="S0041">it's called Hunger Games <pause dur="short"/> yeah I couldn't put it down <pause dur="short"/> so I've only I've got a quarter left</u>
<u n="165" who="S0046">what's it about?</u>
<u n="166" who="S0041">it's set in the future and basically <pause dur="short"/> the Americans had a war and broke broke down into districts <pause dur="short"/> a bit like states I suppose but they're all segregated <pause dur="short"/> nobody is allowed to cross the borders and they all produce different things for the country so one's agriculture one's mining</u>
<u n="167" who="S0046">okay</u>
<u n="168" who="S0041">blah blah blah <pause dur="short"/> and every year because they revolted basically the main people in the capital say right just to prove that this will never happen again we're going to each year you have to give two tributes like like a sacrifice basically <pause dur="short"/> two two people from each district one to twelve have to go to fight in the hunger games <pause dur="short"/> so they put them all in an arena and every year it changes what the terrain's like and whether it's a jungle or it's a desert or anything at all <pause dur="short"/> and they're just basically made to fight till they die <pause dur="short"/> they just leave them there and the idea is that when one person's left they're the winner</u>
<u n="169" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and they give them like <pause dur="short"/> at the very beginning there's a big of the hunger games there's a big like</u>
<u n="171" who="S0046">do you not want to go and see the film?</u>
<u n="172" who="S0041">yeah I do but I need to read it first <pause dur="short"/> from all different weapons and supplies <pause dur="short"/> a piece of plastic or water bottle or stuff <pause dur="short"/> and they all  they all  have to stand on this like round thing till the gong finishes chiming then they're allowed to go <pause dur="short"/> but obviously if you're going for the stuff then some of these people some of the districts have people that really want to go and fight the hunger games and they train the kids up so that they're all huge <pause dur="short"/> whereas other districts they're really poor would do anything not to be chosen and they they still have to go</u>
<u n="173" who="S0086">so you have to make a decision when you're on those little plinths do you run for the forest?</u>
<u n="174" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="175" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0086">or do you run and get the weapons? Cos if you try and get the weapons and someone beats you to they're going to blow your head off</u>
<u n="177" who="S0046">they're going to actually there and then</u>
<u n="178" who="S0086">whereas if you run into the forest <pause dur="short"/> you might survive a bit longer but you haven't got any of the stuff because you've left the stuff behind</u>
<u n="179" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="180" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0086">it's a real <pause dur="short"/> like when you watch it and I imagine when you read it it's really gut wrenching cos you</u>
<u n="182" who="S0046">have you seen it?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0086">yeah I saw it in the cinema</u>
<u n="184" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="185" who="S0086">you <trunc>e</trunc> I think you're always putting yourself in that position like even though it's obviously it's fantasy <pause dur="short"/> what would you do? And it I don't know whether you get the sense of it in the book but in the film obviously it really question like our obsession the reality TV <pause dur="short"/> because everybody's watching it <pause dur="short"/> everybody watches on the big screen so they're also saying like you you would be able to get rid of it <pause dur="short"/> all the kids they think you could be able to banish it if people just stopped watching <pause dur="short"/> but there's this sick fascination with everybody tuning in and everybody watching it <pause dur="short"/> it's kind of you wonder how far we are off that</u>
<u n="186" who="S0046" trans="overlap">and she she starts to play the game a bit like she starts trying to like smile to the cameras and show her face if she's done something good or bad so that it gets people watching so it's <pause dur="short"/> it's like she doesn't want to be their end she doesn't want to kill people but she has to them</u>
<u n="187" who="S0086">Cos then she gets sponsors and she gets little presents and stuff when she's out there <pause dur="short"/> like things to help her</u>
<u n="188" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I just got the bit where she's found em Peter</u>
<u n="189" who="S0086">oh okay</u>
<u n="190" who="S0041">she just found him when he was camouflaged in the river and she saved him</u>
<u n="191" who="S0086">that bit in the film oh my god <pause dur="short"/> but then I but then the film you're like how do they? Why would he even have the stuff with him to be able to camouflage him?</u>
<u n="192" who="S0041">no he's got it out he's made it</u>
<u n="193" who="S0086">oh I see</u>
<u n="194" who="S0041">he's been taught how to use wood and all that stuff</u>
<u n="195" who="S0086" trans="overlap">make it from what you've got</u>
<u n="196" who="S0041">yeah and because of <unclear/></u>
<u n="197" who="S0086" trans="overlap">they gloss over that in the film</u>
<u n="198" who="S0041">he already knew how to do it with icing and stiuff so he already had the skill <pause dur="short"/> he just didn't know the material of saying <pause dur="short"/> before they go into the games when they have the three days of trails they kind of all work together don't they? Have three days of training <pause dur="short"/> one of the stations they could go to was camouflage <pause dur="short"/> so he learned it</u>
<u n="199" who="S0086" trans="overlap">oh I see  I see  Because they do have that bit in the film like there's like two minutes of him like painting his hand like a tree bark and then the bit when they're in the jungle and you can see him all camouflaged it's so expertly done that you think where would he have got this stiff from? It's not really explained like how why what? Don't understand</u>
<u n="200" who="S0041">yeah she says that she looks in the book it says she look down and she doesn't even realise it's him and she's like what the <trunc>fu</trunc> what? And he opens his eyes and smiles and she's like holy fuck</u>
<u n="201" who="S0086" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="202" who="S0041">so she just rescued him and basically carried him cleaned him up got the pus out of his leg and managed to plop him somewhere in this  really looks like it's manmade so if we get spotted we're fucked but he would have come looking for me so <pause dur="short"/> and then he's talking and she has to shut him up so she kisses him and then they get sent and sponsor of stew and so then she clicks like this is what <unclear/> wants <pause dur="short"/> to see them like <unclear/> they're in love <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> oh god <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="203" who="S0086" trans="overlap">they want to see</u>
<u n="204" who="S0046">it gets really good write ups doesn't it?</u>
<u n="205" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's really really good to read <pause dur="short"/> it's like on the same level as Twilight books</u>
<u n="206" who="S0086">mm <pause dur="short"/> not a challenge</u>
<u n="207" who="S0041">like you can <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's not challenging at all <pause dur="short"/> it goes in really easy you never have to reread a sentence lie you can just go through quite quickly</u>
<u n="208" who="S0086">but quite a page turner</u>
<u n="209" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="210" who="S0046">how far in the future is it set? Is it like real future future?</u>
<u n="211" who="S0041">eh</u>

<u n="216" who="S0046">so yeah it's not like ridiculously far on then?</u>
<u n="217" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> but the way that <pause dur="short"/> I'm really excited <pause dur="short"/> I really hope it happen is real life <pause dur="short"/> I like that she gets up in the morning and she goes to the shower and she just pushes the buttons what she wants <pause dur="short"/> whether she wants it to be hot cold jet whether it has lemon stuff or <pause dur="short"/> whether she's going to have exfoliator and then she just presses all these button she says there's like a hundred different offers for the shower <pause dur="short"/> she just stands there and does it and when she gets out of the shower to dry her hair she just puts her hand on this little screen and it sends and electric current through her hair and dries it all</u>

<u n="220" who="S0086">pretty nice</u>
<u n="221" who="S0046">see I I I don't like films that are set too far in the future because they tend to go over the top ridiculously <pause dur="short"/> like Total Recall</u>
<u n="222" who="S0086">that's hilarious</u>
<u n="223" who="S0046">they're <trunc>re</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> they're remaking it aren't they?</u>
