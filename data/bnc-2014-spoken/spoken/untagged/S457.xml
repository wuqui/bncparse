<u n="169" who="S0617" trans="overlap">what because he's on holiday he doesn't have to do his homework?</u>
<u n="170" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no no <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> no not he doesn't have to do it but can have an extension would ask for an extension of maybe a few days <pause dur="short"/> because if he's been given a week of half-term to do his homework and he's gone on holiday and you have to take your holiday in school in the school holiday time and you can't take it any other time</u>
<u n="171" who="S0617" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0525">cos they will fine you <pause dur="short"/> therefore he's on holiday <pause dur="short"/> so she's erm I'm willing to write you a note to say you've been on holiday <pause dur="short"/> can you have an extension of a few days or whatever</u>
<u n="173" who="S0617" trans="overlap">yeah okay that's fair enough yeah</u>

<u n="175" who="S0617" trans="overlap">that's the other side</u>
<u n="176" who="S0525">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and he says no no no it was definitely set on the Friday <pause dur="short"/> she said well I will write you a note and he said oh I I don't want a note that's not gonna work <pause dur="short"/> and then then he found out the other homework was actually revision for a test so he was quite pleased about that because he hadn't got to hand anything in <pause dur="short"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said well you haven't revised yeah but I haven't got to hand anything in <pause dur="short"/> so that's that's a plus</u>
<u n="177" who="S0617" trans="overlap">a bonus</u>

<u n="179" who="S0617">yeah</u>
<u n="180" who="S0525">you insist we take our holiday in school time he's had the holiday so therefore he hasn't been he hasn't been doing homework</u>

<u n="183" who="S0617">oh yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0525" trans="overlap">even so I just I think it's fair comment to ask for a few more days <pause dur="short"/> I think that's fair comment</u>

<u n="629" who="S0525"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said that when she was here about the fact that they wanted the pipe cleaning inside <pause dur="short"/> cos the end caps have come off <pause dur="short"/> but</u>

<u n="631" who="S0617" trans="overlap">ah <unclear/></u>
<u n="632" who="S0525">so they wanted it cleaned out <pause dur="short"/> well they don't no they don't get really dirty</u>
<u n="633" who="S0617">oh</u>
<u n="634" who="S0525">that's the point it was a bit <pause dur="short"/> and and the thing is it's once they put all this stuff in the ground and all that dirt <pause dur="short"/> and leave it for ages</u>
<u n="635" who="S0614" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="636" who="S0525">what what they do is they have to flush it through with a a high pressure water anyway before they start using the pipeline so</u>
<u n="637" who="S0617">oh</u>
<u n="638" who="S0525">it seems a bit pointless to scrub every pipe</u>

<u n="640" who="S0525">they're they're just I think they're just being stalling for money that's all and they're usual tactics anything they can do to stall payment <pause dur="short"/> but you have no choice when you're you know when you're a small company like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is you have to just go with what they want or they just delay it even further <pause dur="short"/> but I'm sure once that bit's done now which it is <pause dur="short"/> you would mainly be ticking off pipes <pause dur="short"/> I I'll write down the numbers for you because <pause dur="short"/> the the the ones in the sevens and the fours and the nines look the same</u>

<u n="646" who="S0614">all he's described it as a as a er a fair degree of manual labour <pause dur="short"/> ten-hour days that's all he reckons</u>
<u n="647" who="S0617">ten-hour days?</u>
<u n="648" who="S0614">I'm sure a ten-hour day for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is probably a five-hour day for everybody else</u>

<u n="650" who="S0614">that's what he's saying isn't it? <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="651" who="S0525" trans="overlap">it won't be ten-hour days because for a start it's too dark to offload at the moment after <pause dur="short"/> well say for because it's still gonna be five o'clock in Scotland they're not going to offload anything else you get there at eight in the morning and it's not gonna be any longer than that <pause dur="short"/> because you <trunc>t</trunc> you tend to have maybe three or four wagons of pipe arriving a day <pause dur="short"/> they might have up to six arriving a day with four pipes on each <pause dur="short"/> that's twenty-four pipes maximum <pause dur="short"/> you have to <pause dur="short"/> right I mean cos it takes two hours <pause dur="short"/> generally to offload those four pipes</u>
<u n="652" who="S0614" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="653" who="S0525">up to two hours <pause dur="short"/> with the cranes or the suction pads or whatever they're doing <pause dur="short"/> so by the <trunc>t</trunc> you know they're offloading the pipes they're checking the quality they're looking somebody else is looking and they might see a nick and you'll have to photograph it and say well this is what they complained about on this one <pause dur="short"/> and then sometimes there are and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> just you can you can repair them quite easily and what he might do is teach you how to repair them and there's a patch that you heat on you know? <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> or generally you're just taking the the numbers down and putting it on a on a delivery sheet and getting somebody in authority to sign it so that they'll pay for it <pause dur="short"/> that's all it is but it's slow because erm <pause dur="short"/> you need a flask of coffee and book half the time <pause dur="short"/> because you you know two hours to offload a wagon and then the next one comes in another two hours to offload them it's only four pipes each time <pause dur="short"/> so it's not difficult it's not like you've got masses of things to look at <pause dur="short"/> you've only got these</u>
<u n="654" who="S0617">mm</u>
<u n="655" who="S0525">four pipes on a wagon to look at <pause dur="short"/> it is boring though I would imagine <pause dur="short"/> but</u>

<u n="660" who="S0614" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it'll be <unclear/> be a lot less</u>
<u n="661" who="S0525">when when if you haven't got anybody on-site then erm they'll just claim that they never had the pipe or they didn't have those numbers or <pause dur="short"/> anything they can do not to pay that the the only reason is to speed up payments <pause dur="short"/> cos what he'll have they'll have had eighty percent of the value of the pipe upfront <pause dur="short"/> but the remaining twenty percent will be <pause dur="short"/> you know probably on thirty days net after delivery <pause dur="short"/> and those thirty days net are when they <pause dur="short"/> mess around and say oh we didn't have that pipe number oh we didn't well that was damaged well we didn't have that <pause dur="short"/> or they didn't turn up that's what they do</u>

<u n="665" who="S0525">that's what it's for <pause dur="short"/> it's nothing more than that <pause dur="short"/> but I don't know where in Scotland it is <pause dur="short"/> and if you're flying up good because like I say you'll be able to hire a car and you don't take your car on-site <pause dur="short"/> your car won't cope</u>

<u n="667" who="S0525">there's a you need four-wheel drives for the <pause dur="short"/> places they go to <pause dur="short"/> so yeah yeah so phone him and find out and if you offer like you say three days a week or something</u>
<u n="668" who="S0617">three days a week for how many weeks?</u>
<u n="669" who="S0525">well they've got two shipments this is the first shipment they've got another container load of pipes coming in</u>

<u n="677" who="S0525">there's a lot of pipes <pause dur="short"/> so <trunc>a</trunc> they're doing it in two halves from what I could gather <pause dur="short"/> and er actually <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> asked me cos he he wanted to know how to defer the VAT and do the payments when I was in <pause dur="short"/> I've only been in once this year and that was his question</u>
<u n="678" who="S0617" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="679" who="S0525">so that's why I know they're doing two shipments <pause dur="short"/> so the first shipment has only just arrived <pause dur="short"/> that will probably go on for maybe six to eight weeks and the next shipment will be another eight weeks <pause dur="short"/> I imagine <pause dur="short"/> I'm guessing but</u>
