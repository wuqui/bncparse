<u n="1" who="S0521">Volkswagen TD whatever</u>
<u n="2" who="S0519" trans="overlap">oh you</u>
<u n="3" who="S0520">oh you could</u>
<u n="4" who="S0519" trans="overlap">it was a very sweet little van we got</u>
<u n="5" who="S0520">it's always funny when you have a new car and you don't know where the bits are some of them have things inside that you</u>
<u n="6" who="S0519">that you tweak yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0520">open the outside on</u>
<u n="8" who="S0521" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="10" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0521">I found a switch inside it opened the bonnet</u>
<u n="12" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="13" who="S0521">I saw the girl looking at me from the</u>
<u n="14" who="S0520">yeah no you start to feel a bit self-conscious don't you? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0521" trans="overlap">inside the er the <trunc>gar</trunc> the</u>
<u n="16" who="S0520">I couldn't on the bike in Thailand I couldn't work out how to turn off the indicator</u>
<u n="17" who="S0521"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="18" who="S0520">cos there's like a switch that you click</u>
<u n="19" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="20" who="S0520">to the right to turn it the right indicator on and vice versa and then how do you turn it off? you think you just flicked it back to the middle but it doesn't it just goes right indicator left indicator right indicator you know like <vocal desc="misc"/> and er then you're driving along with indicators on which isn't ideal so eventually I figured out you have to press it as a like press it as a button</u>
<u n="21" who="S0521">ah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0519">ah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0520" trans="overlap">to turn it off yeah it took me ages it's the kind of thing you don't want to stop and ask someone <vocal desc="laugh"/> just you feel like a bit of a knob</u>
<u n="24" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="25" who="S0520">oh</u>
<u n="26" who="S0519">er so that's a bit odd isn't it? you have to open the passenger door</u>
<u n="27" who="S0521">I think it locks doesn't it? it it says on the cap it's a locking cap</u>
<u n="28" who="S0519">so but what was happening so I dad and I met at <anon type="place"/> in a a Marks and Spencer's sort of petrol station</u>
<u n="29" who="S0520">mm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0519">er and bought a toasty and a coffee and I got in his passenger side and it so I I didn't have a lot of room so I was kind of squeezing out and every time I squeezed out I opened the petrol cap and so every time I went to close the door it wouldn't close cos the petrol cap wasn't in</u>
<u n="31" who="S0521" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0520">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0519">erm so I'd realised but it's a bit daft cos if you're the only driver then you have to go round open the passenger door</u>
<u n="34" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0519">to open the petrol cap it's a bit weird isn't it?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0520">very weird these Germans you expect more from them</u>
<u n="37" who="S0519">I was listening were you listening?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0521" trans="overlap">it a Volkswagen diesel as well</u>
<u n="39" who="S0520">I saw that it was a Volkswagen</u>
<u n="40" who="S0521" trans="overlap">polluting the country</u>
<u n="41" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0519">were you listening to the Volkswagen programme?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0520" trans="overlap">guilty</u>
<u n="44" who="S0521" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="45" who="S0519">I was thought you would be</u>
<u n="46" who="S0520">on Radio four</u>
<u n="47" who="S0519" trans="overlap">it was interesting</u>
<u n="48" who="S0521">it was interesting wasn't it? <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0519">they were saying that Volkswagen really was quite a corrupt company really is what they were saying weren't they?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0519">erm or not corrupt but that it was</u>
<u n="52" who="S0521">it was a family business</u>
<u n="53" who="S0519">the it was a family business and you needed a board that that would question what was happening so</u>
<u n="54" who="S0520">I see yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0519">they all they were all saying you know what do you think happened and they said they all the panel all agreed they were all experts that erm everybody on the board would need to just ask the question so you have somehow very cheaply managed to make the engines do this</u>
<u n="56" who="S0521">much less emissions</u>
<u n="57" who="S0519">much less emissions how did you do it?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0519">erm and they didn't ask that question</u>
<u n="60" who="S0521" trans="overlap">evidently wasn't asked</u>
<u n="61" who="S0520">oh I see because everyone's on the inside type of thing</u>
<u n="62" who="S0519" trans="overlap">erm yeah exactly so everybody just said oh great they've done it cheaply let's just go with that</u>
<u n="63" who="S0520">I'd be surprised if you investigated any company that you wouldn't find all sorts of things going on</u>
<u n="64" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0520">I mean I don't</u>
<u n="66" who="S0519">I I liked what these people were saying they were saying the the the roll of the board is to keep a check that the checks and balances of you know balancing out making the profit against running ethically and all of those things</u>
<u n="67" who="S0520" trans="overlap">ethical things yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0519">erm and that was all the board so they all just basically said you know where does the buck lie? <trunc>se</trunc> they still didn't really get to who did it? so who decided?</u>
<u n="69" who="S0521">who's responsible? well yeah they said that that the board is responsible</u>
<u n="70" who="S0519" trans="overlap">er but every engineer in the in the company</u>
<u n="71" who="S0521">must have known</u>
<u n="72" who="S0519">has to know</u>
<u n="73" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0519">that you're you've put a part in that does this thing you know maybe the people actually fitting the part don't know it but all of the engineers know</u>
<u n="75" who="S0520">mm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0519">so it's er it's dire but they seemed to also say which I thought was really interesting and quite good that they didn't actually think that any other companies were doing it that they were all you know</u>
<u n="77" who="S0521" trans="overlap">yes BMW were fine</u>
<u n="78" who="S0519">cheating on their emissions slightly and that there were gonna be big repercussions for diesel cars but erm nobody was actually in this terrible situation of just lying</u>
<u n="79" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="80" who="S0519">cheating basically</u>
<u n="81" who="S0520">cheating the system yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0519">so the the thing was er erm they were set this task to meet the emissions levels that the Americans wanted and all of the other car manufacturers came up with engineering solutions that cost a lot of money and therefore their cars were dearer the performance wasn't quite a good and other factors came in but they met the criteria</u>
<u n="83" who="S0520" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0519">whereas they just cheated and so they were really popular cos everybody thought well you can get this cheap</u>
<u n="85" who="S0520">affordable yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0519" trans="overlap">affordable clean system</u>
<u n="87" who="S0520"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="88" who="S0519">oh oh oh oh</u>
<u n="89" who="S0520">it's damaging isn't it? for the brand the whole thing</u>
<u n="90" who="S0519">terrible</u>
<u n="91" who="S0521">damaging for the made in Germany brand</u>
<u n="92" who="S0520">agreed agreed yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0521">there was a German on the panel wasn't it?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0520" trans="overlap">it sort of makes you reflect doesn't it?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0519">yeah there was a German on the panel</u>
<u n="96" who="S0521">that's what he said it's damaging for the made in Germany brand</u>
<u n="97" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0520">mm I agree with that puts the whole thing in question a bit</u>
<u n="99" who="S0519">erm</u>

<u n="149" who="S0519" trans="overlap">how do you do that?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0520" trans="overlap">which seems to be a contradiction in terms I'll have to eat one anyway</u>
<u n="151" who="S0521">there's probably an app in the making process</u>
<u n="152" who="S0519" trans="overlap">you'd better test them</u>
<u n="153" who="S0521">an app to reduce the fat when it's being tested</u>

<u n="185" who="S0519">we love those people</u>
<u n="186" who="S0520">and erm I changed in <anon type="place"/> and it was er direct from <anon type="place"/> to <anon type="place"/> and it was all really easy and painless and erm comfortable</u>
<u n="187" who="S0519">I've done that journey a few times</u>
<u n="188" who="S0520">have you?</u>
<u n="189" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="190" who="S0520">no way?</u>
<u n="191" who="S0519">when I was doing my choir from <anon type="place"/> thing I did I did that loop the loop journey erm</u>
<u n="192" who="S0520">well it's really slow till like <anon type="place"/> and after that it's all fine</u>
<u n="193" who="S0519">and then it's pretty damn speedy isn't it? and</u>
<u n="194" who="S0520">it was good</u>
<u n="195" who="S0519">and quite quite nice you know? I'd have a table seat and</u>
<u n="196" who="S0520">yeah that's what I did</u>
<u n="197" who="S0519">I did something</u>
<u n="198" who="S0520">working</u>
<u n="199" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="200" who="S0520">and erm yeah and productive quite productive and it was completely full when I got on cos people commute from the <trunc>inter</trunc><trunc>intermed</trunc>intermediate stations you know to <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="202" who="S0520">so all of those people were going home so I didn't have a seat at the beginning but after one or two stops it was all fine</u>

<u n="210" who="S0521">and you had to produce independent evidence of identity</u>
<u n="211" who="S0520">crikey</u>
