<u n="381" who="S0230" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="382" who="S0198">I guess what it might be it's it's the same amount of hours or whatever cos of having to drive and stuff but the actual contact time isn't so erm stressful it's not so constant surely once if you go go between houses you have time to you know take a break for ten minutes or something at least you're sat down</u>
<u n="383" who="S0230">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="384" who="S0198">so I don't see I just the only thing it might be is getting time off cos you might feel a bit more committed to the individual <pause dur="short"/> individual er customers</u>

<u n="480" who="S0198"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="481" who="S0230">yeah well I thought we'd probably cos I if I still have the two weeks off</u>
<u n="482" who="S0198">yeah</u>

<u n="488" who="S0198">but I did get an email through <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said this morning he checked his messages and he looked at the handbook for the module I've chosen and it says something about having I think I have to sign up to a language class for free but I have to experience and document learning a second language for myself as part of my course so that might really mess up my nice schedule that I <vocal desc="laugh"/> have at the moment</u>
<u n="489" who="S0230"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="490" who="S0198">I'm a little bit annoyed about it if that's the case I'm happy to do it but I'd rather do it in my lecture time than give myself extra hours of studying do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="491" who="S0230">yeah</u>
<u n="492" who="S0198">and I've got a feeling it's gonna there's gonna be some real abstract lesson er languages there so it's not gonna be anything easy or anything new to learn and it doesn't matter how well you learn it but I've still gotta go through the process in order to write my diary thing it's like <trunc>thir</trunc> it's like three thousand words <pause dur="short"/> developmental diary or something I'm like ah I'm already thinking about changing modules</u>
<u n="493" who="S0230"><vocal desc="laugh"/> ah</u>
<u n="494" who="S0198">but hopefully I'll have the Wednesday off so either come to you or you can come to me</u>
<u n="495" who="S0229" trans="overlap">have you done anything to the laptop to make it better?</u>
<u n="496" who="S0198">no not yet because we haven't had the internet have we? so <pause dur="short"/> erm I'm just like I haven't even turned it on really I charged it today but no I said I'll sort it out</u>
<u n="497" who="S0230" trans="overlap">for sale</u>
<u n="498" who="S0198">what's that our new laptop?</u>
<u n="499" who="S0230">that's your new one</u>
<u n="500" who="S0198">yeah it's on Windows eight point one which is similar to yours</u>
<u n="501" who="S0230">yeah</u>
<u n="502" who="S0198">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> gave me the quick lowdown on how much better it actually is <pause dur="short"/> it's pretty</u>
<u n="503" who="S0230">what than eight?</u>
<u n="504" who="S0198">well no no it's just better than the Windows before</u>
<u n="505" who="S0230">ah</u>
<u n="506" who="S0198">he said it is really good</u>
<u n="507" who="S0230">they look the same to me I don't really know the difference between the two to be honest but the way you've the way you can use Windows eight or Windows eight point one with that like application looking desktop screen does save you a hell of a lot of time that you that is your start bar</u>
<u n="508" who="S0229">we've got Windows eight eight point one now added</u>
<u n="509" who="S0198">oh you updated it did you?</u>
<u n="510" who="S0229">yeah I done it last night</u>
<u n="511" who="S0198">so next time I'm home I might give you a quick lowdown but then I did it depends what you use your computer for you you don't really use it for much</u>
<u n="512" who="S0230">no we don't do we?</u>
<u n="513" who="S0198">but for us it's good because when you turn on your computer everything's already there for you to click on so if you click on your mail application <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s got both his Hotmail and his Gmail linked to that account so even though he's got two separate emails accounts from different companies they're both linked under that and they both stay open automatically you click on the Facebook app and you're already logged in like you're already logged in to lots of different things already</u>
<u n="514" who="S0230">ah</u>
<u n="515" who="S0198">which saves you the whole time of going to the internet and opening it it you can save documents on there and stuff stuff it's it's just there it's just faster they call it your start screen because before you used to go to start in the bottom left corner didn't you?</u>
<u n="516" who="S0230">yeah</u>
<u n="517" who="S0198">and that brought up everything well now you don't have to do that that is what is on your screen</u>
<u n="518" who="S0230">oh</u>
<u n="519" who="S0198">that's the whole idea of it that is your start bar</u>
<u n="520" who="S0230">oh</u>
<u n="521" who="S0198">so once you get kind of over that and you get used to how you have to click and drag things around the screen that's not that bad at all he seems quite happy with it so</u>
<u n="522" who="S0230">good</u>
<u n="523" who="S0198">yeah I mean</u>
<u n="524" who="S0230">what did he pay for that one?</u>
<u n="525" who="S0198">three fifty</u>
<u n="526" who="S0230">oh that's not bad</u>
<u n="527" who="S0198">on on from Amazon yeah it was on sale but yeah so not bad at all I mean it's not I think it feels a bit flimsy as an actual laptop I guess they're getting lighter and lighter anyway it's Lenovo it's a Chinese company</u>
<u n="528" who="S0230">oh</u>
<u n="529" who="S0198">and er some people love it and some people like buy the products and it doesn't work</u>
<u n="530" who="S0230"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="531" who="S0198">so it's a bit hit and miss but overall they get good reviews</u>
<u n="532" who="S0230">ah</u>
<u n="533" who="S0198">as good as any other company and for that price it's gonna do what we need it to do for the next couple of years so can't really grumble erm but yeah it's definitely yeah it's fine three fifty can't complain but really it's I mean we call it our laptop or <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> does but I mean really it's his laptop</u>
<u n="534" who="S0230"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="535" who="S0198">he got he wanted to show me it show me everything and I just don't find it very exciting</u>
<u n="536" who="S0230"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="537" who="S0198">he's <unclear/> telling me to stop unpacking when we first moved in he was like let me show you this like just sit down for two minutes and let me do this let me show you I don't really care the printer came something else he's ordered ah I don't find it that interesting</u>
