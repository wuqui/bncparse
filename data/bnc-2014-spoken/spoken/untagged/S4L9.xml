<u n="7" who="S0146">for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that day <pause dur="short"/> I said as a um as a reward for her spending her whole weekend on the application that's what I got</u>
<u n="8" who="S0018">oh <pause dur="short"/> I never</u>
<u n="9" who="S0146">should we go to <anon type="place"/>'s today?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0018">oh <pause dur="short"/> that would be good <pause dur="short"/> is that where you bought them from?</u>
<u n="11" who="S0004">I'm going climbing</u>
<u n="12" who="S0146">that's yeah from um what's it? Yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0146">from Lady <trunc>Po</trunc> is it <anon type="place"/> road or</u>
<u n="15" who="S0018">yeah the one you told me about</u>
<u n="16" who="S0146">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0018">sounds good <pause dur="short"/> I have to get <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> in on the act</u>
<u n="18" who="S0146">I was gonna say let's see if they're up for it as well cos they might want a little bit and we can just get loads like little snacky bits and they're so um cheap as well like two pounds fifty</u>
<u n="19" who="S0018">and healthy</u>
<u n="20" who="S0146">I don't know if they're necessarily the healthiest actually cos a lot of that stuff is sort of fried and</u>
<u n="21" who="S0004">oh</u>
<u n="22" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0004">doughy fried</u>
<u n="24" who="S0146">but</u>
<u n="25" who="S0004">full of butter</u>
<u n="26" who="S0146">but I'll show you what it is is</u>
<u n="27" who="S0004">butter</u>
<u n="28" who="S0018">ghee <pause dur="short"/> ghee</u>
<u n="29" who="S0146">this is what</u>
<u n="30" who="S0004">sorry</u>
<u n="31" who="S0146">this is what  eh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had eight crispy buris which are like little balls and they're hollow <pause dur="short"/> and remember I said stuff with potatoes chick peas and onion</u>
<u n="32" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0146">and <trunc>tam</trunc> and that tamarind water</u>

<u n="35" who="S0004">that was it</u>
<u n="36" who="S0146">oh yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0018">but do you put the water inside the ball?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0146">yeah so you put all the potatoey stuff in and then you just fill up the rest of it with the tamarind water so you can get it</u>
<u n="39" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="40" who="S0146">as tamarind as a solid thing and you dilute it into a jug</u>
<u n="41" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0146">and you just it's pani water so you just um it's flavoured water and it's just <pause dur="short"/> em it's like my favourite food</u>

<u n="58" who="S0004">new personal best again</u>
<u n="59" who="S0018">ooh <pause dur="short"/> have you got an app to time yourself?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0004">no what happens is you've have a little barcode</u>
<u n="61" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="62" who="S0004">so everyone starts at the same time <pause dur="short"/> and then when you finish the line they give you a barcode</u>
<u n="63" who="S0018">ah it's organised?</u>
<u n="64" who="S0004">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they give you a barcode and then you scan your own unique barcode so that matches the placing with</u>
<u n="65" who="S0018">mm okay</u>
<u n="66" who="S0004">your name <pause dur="short"/> and they send you an email with your time and like your finishing place in your age category and your overall performance and stuff</u>
<u n="67" who="S0018">who organises it?</u>
<u n="68" who="S0004">it's called Park Run dot org</u>
<u n="69" who="S0146">oh okay</u>
<u n="70" who="S0018">which park is it in?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0004">Cannon Hill</u>
<u n="72" who="S0018">it that where <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was doing her boot camp?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0146">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="74" who="S0004"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/>? Who's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0018"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> Badoo</u>
<u n="76" who="S0146">remember the friend who I was gonna put you in touch with with the drama?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0004">yes</u>
<u n="78" who="S0146">yeah her</u>
<u n="79" who="S0004">well <trunc>st</trunc> I'm still open to that</u>
<u n="80" who="S0018">are you a thespian?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0004">I often claim it to be my alternative career if I ever pursued it</u>
<u n="82" who="S0018">really? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="83" who="S0146"><anon type="place"/> is fine <pause dur="short"/> I'm just looking for where<anon type="place"/> is</u>
<u n="84" who="S0018">where did you say it was <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0146">it's um it's <anon type="place"/> actually</u>
<u n="86" who="S0018">but what area is that in?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0146">so that's um <trunc>s</trunc> called like also <anon type="place"/> Spark Broke</u>
<u n="88" who="S0018">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> and now you're going climbing as well?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0004">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0018">where's that?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0004">em Creation in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0018">oh the same one you went to the other day?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0004">mm <pause dur="short"/> so did the legs this morning do a bit of legs and arms this afternoon</u>
<u n="94" who="S0018">sounds like fun</u>
<u n="95" who="S0004">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's eh I'll be shaking again I expect <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> It's quite scary when you're lead climbing <pause dur="short"/> when you don't have a rope tied onto you</u>
<u n="96" who="S0018">you don't have a safety?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0004">you do but as you go up you clip your rope on</u>
<u n="98" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="99" who="S0004">and then every so often you clip on again it's like every two metres or every metre and a half two metres <pause dur="short"/> but um if you fall when you're closest to clipping on then potentially you could fall like two two times two four metres ish <pause dur="short"/> which is enough to kind of</u>
<u n="100" who="S0018">are there safety mats?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0004">em well no not the big climbing walls because you're tied on <pause dur="short"/> so you'd never fall to the ground you'd just go boof</u>
<u n="102" who="S0018">oh <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="103" who="S0004">you'd swing and drop <pause dur="short"/> but then when you do bouldering they have like crash mats underneath so that's perfectly safe</u>
<u n="104" who="S0018">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> you're going with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0004">no he's in London</u>
<u n="106" who="S0018">is he?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0146">is he?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0004">yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0018">what's he doing there?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0004">eh meeting some of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s friends and some of his friends apparently and then they're coming back later on</u>
<u n="111" who="S0018">is <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> his girlfriend? The one we met the other day?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0004">well yeah if he's calling her his girlfriend yeah I don't think he is</u>
<u n="113" who="S0146">boyfriend?</u>
<u n="114" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="115" who="S0004">if he's calling her his boyfriend yeah <pause dur="short"/> I made the mistake last night of mentioning that um <vocal desc="laugh"/> people claim we were having a bromance?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0004">so she used that on me like for the rest of the night</u>
<u n="118" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="119" who="S0018">more than flatmates <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>y</trunc> you two are quite good buddies as well aren't you?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0004">well we're kind of like into the similar things</u>
<u n="121" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0004">chasing women <pause dur="short"/> climbing up walls going running going cycling and in engineering so</u>
<u n="123" who="S0018">all at the same time</u>
<u n="124" who="S0004">yeah that would proper be properly ambidextrous</u>
<u n="125" who="S0018">what kind of engineering does he do?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0004">manufacturing <pause dur="short"/> although he's like a quality improvement engineer <pause dur="short"/> so he takes a process and then sees how it can be improved</u>
<u n="127" who="S0018">ah okay</u>
<u n="128" who="S0004">they use a lot of Japanese theory like lean manufacturing so you don't have you don't keep a lot of stock and it's all like moving the products efficiently and like removing bottle necks through a process and making sure that you cut down on operational costs and include like the thoughts of people</u>
<u n="129" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="130" who="S0004">and just improve the working environment</u>
<u n="131" who="S0018">but I mean okay I'm a total non-expert but to me that doesn't sound like anything to do with engineering <pause dur="short"/> isn't engineering like</u>
<u n="132" who="S0004">you have a quality engineer</u>
<u n="133" who="S0018">building?</u>
<u n="134" who="S0004">I mean the definition of engineering is like applying physics to its applied physics to the real world</u>
<u n="135" who="S0018">ah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0004">so you make things happen</u>
<u n="137" who="S0018">I thought it was all about engines innit? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="138" who="S0004">engineering itself is not all about engines</u>
<u n="139" who="S0018">so there's a lot of different fields of engineering?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0004">well I'm in energy he's in manufacturing transport pharmaceutical biomechanical engineering</u>
<u n="141" who="S0018">oh right</u>
<u n="142" who="S0004">it's a broad remit there's like loads of different institutions you've got the IMechE the IChemE <pause dur="short"/> institute of Civil Engineers <pause dur="short"/> there's all sorts of different</u>
<u n="143" who="S0018">is civil engineering like building structures</u>
<u n="144" who="S0004">building and structures yeah so underground works and above ground works</u>
<u n="145" who="S0018">and what did you specialise in?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0004">I did mechanical engineering <pause dur="short"/> of which half of it was <trunc>pain</trunc> painful and useless</u>
<u n="147" who="S0018">so what's mechanical engineering? It that about engines</u>
<u n="148" who="S0004">em it's about it's not about electricity cos that's electrical engineering <pause dur="short"/> it's not about computers it's not about buildings <pause dur="short"/> so it's basically yeah car engines pumps um trying to think what else <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>th</trunc> there's a lot of thermodynamics which is so you've got like a fluid like water is used a lot in a power station for example to transmit energy and make electricity <pause dur="short"/> so there's a lot of mechanical engineering involved in that</u>
<u n="149" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="150" who="S0004">and the things that carry the water and what not</u>
<u n="151" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="152" who="S0004">very intriguing</u>
<u n="153" who="S0018">and do you use did you do a Masters in that?</u>
<u n="154" who="S0004">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0018">and do you use what you learnt in your job?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0004">em I use like some of the business bits <pause dur="short"/> I use the kind of the process and logic <pause dur="short"/> I don't use the bits about computational fluid dynamics and internal combustion engines cos I just don't do that <pause dur="short"/> but I use a bit of the stuff that I did on power engineering and</u>
<u n="157" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="158" who="S0004">it's very rare that you do a course and you use like a hundred percent of it in your career</u>
<u n="159" who="S0018">yeah true <pause dur="short"/> true <pause dur="short"/> what did you study in?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0146">where? At university?</u>
<u n="161" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0146"><trunc>His</trunc> Modern History and Politics and then my postgrad was in broadcast journalism</u>
<u n="163" who="S0018">where did you do that?</u>
<u n="164" who="S0146"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="165" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0004">did you? I don't know that</u>
<u n="167" who="S0146">it was <anon type="place"/> for History and Politics and then <anon type="place"/> for a year</u>

<u n="172" who="S0004">didn't you hear about the record we talked about this</u>
<u n="173" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="174" who="S0004">the biggest ever fox caught in Scotland <pause dur="short"/> it was like the size of eh Saint Bernard apparently it was huge</u>
<u n="175" who="S0146">oh God</u>
<u n="176" who="S0018">but there's one that runs around my parents road at night and I've seen it quite often and it's cos I look at when I see it I see it from above it's a sturdy thing <pause dur="short"/> it's like the shoulders are really broad</u>
<u n="177" who="S0146">that's how those um foxes mauled that um</u>
<u n="178" who="S0004">baby</u>

<u n="494" who="S0018">that was brilliant</u>
<u n="495" who="S0146">well so she was talking about her life actually and she's quite interesting like she sort of said that you know she started off an apprenticeship at the age of seventeen and you know the fact that her mum absolutely resented having kids and you know and she was like basically a mother of the second world war who was quite intelligent and thought you know actually I've had these kids but I don't want them and went to study and got degrees and all of that and actually you know resented Annika and so they grew up basically you know no baking no nothing never you know and</u>
<u n="496" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="497" who="S0146">so she grew up quite fast and then she talked about sort of like going her friends going to university and her not and she got an apprenticeship at the BBC when she was seventeen and pretended she was twenty-five because so she could be taken seriously and <pause dur="short"/> and you know and then she left the industry like the public eye around the time of the Jill Dando shooting stuff</u>
<u n="498" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="499" who="S0146">and then sort of fell out of love with like British TV and thought it was all really insipid and this all sort of reality culture and how people started calling her and harassing her family and</u>
<u n="500" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="501" who="S0146">you know <pause dur="short"/> well like um you know she said you know I'd be in a cab going somewhere with my kids and you know as soon as the cab go there the paparazzi were already there to photograph her she just</u>

<u n="504" who="S0018">and she actually left</u>
<u n="505" who="S0146">and she just felt so disillusioned <pause dur="short"/> she left the public eye but then she she's a clever little lady <pause dur="short"/> she like painted a picture of oh you know I went to art college you know I sell paintings and stuff <pause dur="short"/> but actually also what she's been doing is selling the rights of Challenge Anneka across the world</u>

<u n="804" who="S0146">em and actually it would be better for him to be in London <pause dur="short"/> cos he'd be in the fold so if they got that I reckon they would probably settle down <pause dur="short"/> they would probably do about a year and then I think you know they'd baby babyfication would begin <vocal desc="laugh"/> And equally if she doesn't get it I think you know I think they might restart the house hunt</u>
<u n="805" who="S0018">yeah but she was saying that if even if she gets the job they'll still try and buy a house around here?</u>
<u n="806" who="S0146">yeah as an investment</u>
<u n="807" who="S0018">oh right</u>
<u n="808" who="S0146">because they can always live at <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s house in Ealing</u>
<u n="809" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="810" who="S0146">they can buy this as an investment because it's good for them and also you know if they ever came back because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s parents are here and stuff like that</u>
<u n="811" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="812" who="S0146">this is a good base isn't it? So</u>
<u n="813" who="S0018">definitely</u>
<u n="814" who="S0146">but I think you know in terms of like a longer-term sort of you know a a nest egg that's what they'd they might do and then they might move to London and stay at <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s</u>
<u n="815" who="S0018">it's difficult to know what house prices are gonna do though isn't it? I don't know whether actually is it an investment any more buying a house?</u>
<u n="816" who="S0146">or is it a liability?</u>
<u n="817" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="818" who="S0146">exactly <pause dur="short"/> you know what <trunc>t</trunc> the trick is year house prices are low and interest rates are low but interest rates are gonna rise and when they do mortgage rates will rise <pause dur="short"/> and it's about being able to afford the mortgage when you've got an extra two hundred and fifty odd quid on top of that</u>
<u n="819" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="820" who="S0146">and you've got deep unemployment you can't rent it out</u>
<u n="821" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="822" who="S0146">can you carry on with those mortgage payments cos otherwise you're ruined</u>
<u n="823" who="S0018">well that's the thing I think if you've got a mortgage a few years ago you know you you</u>
<u n="824" who="S0146">two thousand and eight</u>
<u n="825" who="S0018">you it ends up being cheaper than rent cheaper than monthly rent <pause dur="short"/> but people I know that are getting mortgages nowadays it's actually more expensive than renting and it's over half of their salary <pause dur="short"/> I think I remember my dad always used to say a guide of mortgages you shouldn't pay more than a third of your salary but I think that's just impossible now</u>
<u n="826" who="S0146">but that's if you've got um a lot of you know a good down payment a good deposit then it's you know and and many you know whose <pause dur="short"/> my parents can't give me sixty grand you know to put into a house</u>
<u n="827" who="S0018"><vocal desc="gasp"/> Blimey is that how much you need for a down payment these days?</u>
<u n="828" who="S0146">you need  You need  to give twenty percent at least</u>
<u n="829" who="S0018"><vocal desc="gasp"/> Blimey</u>
<u n="830" who="S0146">at least and then it also varies you know and that's the absolute minimum you need to put down at least twenty percent of the price of the property and that is without any you know legal fees you know consultancy fees</u>
<u n="831" who="S0018">but if the average</u>
<u n="832" who="S0146" trans="overlap">any work you've done it any furniture anything</u>
<u n="833" who="S0018">if the average salary is twenty-five thousand</u>
<u n="834" who="S0146">yeah</u>
<u n="835" who="S0018">which let's face it is barely a <trunc>liv</trunc> a living wage</u>
<u n="836" who="S0146">yeah</u>
<u n="837" who="S0018">how on earth are people supposed to A be able to invest in property</u>
<u n="838" who="S0146">so the people that can do it</u>
<u n="839" who="S0018">and have somewhere</u>
<u n="840" who="S0146">are people where parents give you like fat sum of like fifty grand</u>
<u n="841" who="S0018">but then then they're saying save for your retirement <pause dur="short"/> how are you supposed to save for retirement when property costs so much and the price of living is so high and salaries are so low I mean there seems to be a huge jump between</u>
<u n="842" who="S0146">it's the disparity  it's the disparity  and that's why it just seems it was talking to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because she's you know she was saying it's only in Britain where there is that emphasis you know where there's this sort of twin track you know this divided committee and where you know something like a house is looked upon as an asset <pause dur="short"/> whereas actually across Europe renting is is a big you know is a big thing and actually</u>
<u n="843" who="S0018">well I think there's some logic to it because when you retire you can sell your house</u>
<u n="844" who="S0146">exactly</u>
<u n="845" who="S0018">downsize and you've made</u>
<u n="846" who="S0146">yeah</u>
<u n="847" who="S0018">a bit of income from it</u>
<u n="848" who="S0146">yeah</u>
<u n="849" who="S0018">I mean cos if you  if you  don't I mean you've got nowhere to live <pause dur="short"/> if you never buy and then you retire you're you've got to pay a lot of your peanuts that you receive in pension</u>
<u n="850" who="S0146">in rent</u>
<u n="851" who="S0018">in rent or buying a house <pause dur="short"/> whereas if you contribute to a house all your life and then sell it and buy another one at least you don't have to pay rent</u>
<u n="852" who="S0146">mm</u>
<u n="853" who="S0018">and all your pension is spent <pause dur="short"/> you can spend it</u>
<u n="854" who="S0146">I wish I knew how smart people did it like there was a guy that um used to work at the BBC <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and he bought a house in Harbourn on War Lane</u>
<u n="855" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="856" who="S0146">that main road and you know just off the High Street</u>
<u n="857" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="858" who="S0146">and he bought it at the right time and he got it for ninety-eight grand</u>
<u n="859" who="S0018">wow</u>
<u n="860" who="S0146">and then he sold it for two hundred and ten grand</u>
<u n="861" who="S0018">oh my life how many years later?</u>
<u n="862" who="S0146">four years later</u>
<u n="863" who="S0018">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="864" who="S0146">so he caught it at the right bloody time</u>
<u n="865" who="S0018">Jammy dodge dodger <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="866" who="S0146">and then his partner Andrew also did the very similar thing <pause dur="short"/> you know off the Pershaw Road there's first second third avenue?</u>
<u n="867" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="868" who="S0146">I think it was on second avenue that he bought a house and he got a good extra hundred grand off the back of that</u>
<u n="869" who="S0018">yeah no see if I  if I  had um if I had been given a permanent contract in Spain I would have been able to buy at the time when it would have been extremely lucrative</u>
<u n="870" who="S0146">yeah</u>
<u n="871" who="S0018">because like fourteen years ago it would have cost thirty thousand? To get thirty thousand pounds to get a three bedroomed flat</u>
<u n="872" who="S0146">no way</u>
<u n="873" who="S0018">which now even with the the property crisis over there actually would it would probably be quite difficult to sell but for example had I bought it fourteen years ago and then sold it six years ago it would have</u>
<u n="874" who="S0146">you'd have been about a hundred and eighty now</u>
<u n="875" who="S0018">oh at least <pause dur="short"/> oh it just makes me sick <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's not fair the way that the <trunc>mar</trunc> you know <pause dur="short"/> everything is so dependent on the market how the market plays it's like these are basic human needs</u>
<u n="876" who="S0146">yeah</u>
<u n="877" who="S0018">to have shelter</u>
<u n="878" who="S0146">yeah</u>
<u n="879" who="S0018">to be able to earn a living wage that you with which you can pay</u>
<u n="880" who="S0146">yeah</u>
<u n="881" who="S0018">fuel and food and it just seems that nowadays there's no  there's no  guarantee of being able to have that</u>
<u n="882" who="S0146">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="883" who="S0018">oh good job <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s not here he'd be going <vocal desc="laugh"/> going crazy over the subject oh it's Labour's fault oh it's the politicians <pause dur="short"/> I agree it's the politicians but they're all as bad as each other</u>
