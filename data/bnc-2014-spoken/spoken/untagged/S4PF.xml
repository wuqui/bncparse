<u n="100" who="S0324" trans="overlap">but I don't like mathematics like mathematicians always try and <pause dur="short"/> find reasons why things happen</u>
<u n="101" who="S0325">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0324">and it's</u>

<u n="128" who="S0324">yeah she's</u>
<u n="129" who="S0325" trans="overlap">she's</u>
<u n="130" who="S0324">really bad</u>
<u n="131" who="S0325">I know</u>
<u n="132" who="S0324">I mean she sort of deals she kind of deals with them better than you think she does</u>
<u n="133" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0324">but still</u>
<u n="135" who="S0325" trans="overlap">but she still like favouritises them</u>
<u n="136" who="S0324">yeah I know</u>
<u n="137" who="S0325">that's why they behave a little bit for her</u>
<u n="138" who="S0324" trans="overlap">how can you favouritise them? it's yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0325">I don't understand why teachers give them so many second chances chances though like</u>
<u n="140" who="S0324">yeah I'd just</u>
<u n="141" who="S0325" trans="overlap">cos it</u>
<u n="142" who="S0324">like</u>
<u n="143" who="S0325">be like get out of my classroom</u>
<u n="144" who="S0324" trans="overlap">yeah exactly or I think the tactic you have to do is like embarrass them or something</u>
<u n="145" who="S0325" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0324">or maybe</u>
<u n="147" who="S0325" trans="overlap">like Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was had his hands under the table</u>
<u n="148" who="S0324" trans="overlap">oh yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="149" who="S0325" trans="overlap">and he was like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I don't know what you're fiddling with under there but <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="150" who="S0324">it's giving the wrong impression</u>
<u n="151" who="S0325"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="152" who="S0324">or something</u>
<u n="153" who="S0325">but also all I'd want is</u>
<u n="154" who="S0324" trans="overlap">or like do you remember when Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> did that erm lesson about is Dylan and outlier?</u>
<u n="155" who="S0325">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="156" who="S0324" trans="overlap">and we had to work out if he was really bad</u>
<u n="157" who="S0325">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> I felt a little bit sorry for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> though because when he got moved down</u>
<u n="158" who="S0324" trans="overlap">yeah <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is so much worse that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="159" who="S0325">I know</u>
<u n="160" who="S0324">at maths</u>
<u n="161" who="S0325">why is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="162" who="S0324" trans="overlap">but somehow <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s in top set and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is I think it's because Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> did actually favouritise <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="163" who="S0325">yeah because he</u>
<u n="164" who="S0324" trans="overlap">there was</u>
<u n="165" who="S0325" trans="overlap">really liked <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="166" who="S0324">yeah he did</u>
<u n="167" who="S0325" trans="overlap">and I remember <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was like oh I'm not on there I guess I've got moved down and Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> was like well I guess you did</u>
<u n="168" who="S0324">yeah I know if that was <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="169" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0324">he'd be like oh sorry I didn't that one or like</u>
<u n="171" who="S0325"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="172" who="S0324">or like not mention it</u>
<u n="173" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="174" who="S0324">like he didn't mention <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that she moved down but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> asked</u>
<u n="175" who="S0325" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0324">to get moved down</u>
<u n="177" who="S0325" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0324">but still <trunc>h</trunc> he didn't mention her</u>
<u n="179" who="S0325">I don't know why <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> asked to be moved down</u>
<u n="180" who="S0324" trans="overlap">but he won't</u>
<u n="181" who="S0325">cos she's always going on about how maths is her strong point and stuff</u>
<u n="182" who="S0324">yeah and she</u>
<u n="183" who="S0325" trans="overlap">and when she did well in that test like</u>
<u n="184" who="S0324" trans="overlap">I don't think she was actually that bad at maths</u>
<u n="185" who="S0325">no <pause dur="short"/> well I see what she means but</u>
<u n="186" who="S0324" trans="overlap">she's in like the bottom</u>
<u n="187" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0324">half of the maths group</u>
<u n="189" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="190" who="S0324">but she's still</u>
<u n="191" who="S0325">I dunno I kind of I like maths when I can do it because it's sort of it's it's a nice feeling when you get a question right</u>
<u n="192" who="S0324"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="193" who="S0325">but</u>
<u n="194" who="S0324">yeah</u>
<u n="195" who="S0325">and normally I just don't get it</u>
<u n="196" who="S0324" trans="overlap">yeah with English you can't do that</u>
<u n="197" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0324">but with English there's no like I think that's why I don't like English really <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0325" trans="overlap">yeah cos you're very</u>
<u n="200" who="S0324" trans="overlap">erm cos I like</u>
<u n="201" who="S0325" trans="overlap">all a very logical person aren't you?</u>
<u n="202" who="S0324" trans="overlap">having like an answer</u>
<u n="203" who="S0325">yeah a right or wrong</u>
<u n="204" who="S0324" trans="overlap">knowing if it's right or wrong not <pause dur="short"/> things like how can I improve on this sentence?</u>
<u n="205" who="S0325"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="206" who="S0324">or something</u>
<u n="207" who="S0325">but also er</u>
<u n="208" who="S0324" trans="overlap">and it's really hard to know like where you're going wrong like when we were writing our <pause dur="short"/> assessments</u>
<u n="209" who="S0325">mm</u>
<u n="210" who="S0324">I didn't know <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I didn't know how to like <pause dur="short"/> make it better I dunno I'm gonna fail with that one</u>
<u n="211" who="S0325" trans="overlap">but the no the thing is the reason that I don't I'm not too sure about English is because I've never been like that particularly good at English in the past I've just been alright in the top set you know sort of bobbing along but then now</u>
<u n="212" who="S0324" trans="overlap">and now you're suddenly amazing</u>
<u n="213" who="S0325">yeah so I'm just a bit worried that Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> <pause dur="short"/> because obviously the teachers are marking it so <pause dur="short"/> it's sort of their opinion like if they like your writing style</u>
<u n="214" who="S0324" trans="overlap">yeah every teacher is gonna mark you</u>
<u n="215" who="S0325" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="216" who="S0324">differently</u>
<u n="217" who="S0325" trans="overlap">so if they like your writing style they give you a high mark and if they don't like it they give you a low mark so it's sort of like</u>
<u n="218" who="S0324" trans="overlap">yeah well before we had Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and she didn't like you</u>
<u n="219" who="S0325">no she didn't like me at all</u>
<u n="220" who="S0324" trans="overlap">well actually she hated me <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="221" who="S0325">oh <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="222" who="S0324">and she like called me a pain or whatever</u>
<u n="223" who="S0325"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
