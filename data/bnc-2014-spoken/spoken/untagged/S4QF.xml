<u n="140" who="S0369">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0252">the er Competition Markets Authority has er <pause dur="short"/> made a er a <trunc>s</trunc> a sort of er notice of some concerns</u>
<u n="142" who="S0368">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0252" trans="overlap">in regard to Richard Branson operating the East Coast Main Line</u>
<u n="144" who="S0369">has he?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0251">oh right</u>
<u n="146" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="147" who="S0369">mm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0252">er problems are that there would be insufficient competition between erm Grantham and Newark and Edinburgh to Dundee because there would be er too much of the services would be run by</u>
<u n="149" who="S0369" trans="overlap">by Branson</u>
<u n="150" who="S0252">Stagecoach are Virgin and its companies because between Newark and Grantham the only other sort of competition is East Midlands Trains which is also which is a Stagecoach company</u>
<u n="151" who="S0251">oh right</u>
<u n="152" who="S0252">and erm between Edinburgh and Dundee a significant amount of the services are run by Scottish Citylink coach service which is also Stagecoach</u>
<u n="153" who="S0369">yes</u>
<u n="154" who="S0252">so they've got a week to er suggest how such issues can be remedied</u>
<u n="155" who="S0369" trans="overlap">hey when you think about that run <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the distance between Newark and Grantham</u>
<u n="156" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="157" who="S0369">it's not all that great is it?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0251" trans="overlap">is it the next stop?</u>
<u n="159" who="S0369">more or less <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0251"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="161" who="S0369">there's not much in it</u>
<u n="162" who="S0252">mm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0369">and so you know they've got all that run and then just</u>
<u n="164" who="S0251">that bit</u>
<u n="165" who="S0369">a little bit in the middle</u>
<u n="166" who="S0251">no no no</u>
<u n="167" who="S0369" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="168" who="S0251">what about Edinburgh to Dundee is that a long</u>
<u n="169" who="S0252">that is a</u>
<u n="170" who="S0251" trans="overlap">piece?</u>
<u n="171" who="S0252" trans="overlap">very good stretch</u>
<u n="172" who="S0369" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="173" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="174" who="S0369" trans="overlap">that that would be a bit longer wouldn't it? but nevertheless</u>
<u n="175" who="S0368">so there isn't enough competition is that what they're saying?</u>
<u n="176" who="S0252">they're saying that</u>
<u n="177" who="S0251" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0252">well currently it's the East Coast is held by the state so the issue of competition doesn't exist because</u>
<u n="179" who="S0368" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="180" who="S0252" trans="overlap">the state doesn't compete with itself</u>
<u n="181" who="S0368">no</u>
<u n="182" who="S0252">but because it will be operated by Stagecoach and Virgin</u>
<u n="183" who="S0368">yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0252">there's they the Competition and Markets Authority doesn't think there'll be enough competition between those routes because I think about nearly eighty or ninety percent of the services would be operated by them which then puts them in a position to either increase their prices</u>
<u n="185" who="S0368">yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0252">or reduce their service frequencies</u>
<u n="187" who="S0369">mm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0252">which would not be in the interests of the traveller</u>

<u n="192" who="S0369">I don't</u>
<u n="193" who="S0368" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="194" who="S0251">it seemed to be going on alright</u>
<u n="195" who="S0369" trans="overlap">yeah I mean to be honest I would have er like British Railways back again</u>
<u n="196" who="S0252">mm</u>
<u n="197" who="S0251" trans="overlap">it wasn't popular at the time but</u>
<u n="198" who="S0369">no it's not popular or let me put it this way you'd think it's not popular</u>
<u n="199" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="200" who="S0369">because you've got like the <pause dur="short"/> certain sections of the community</u>
<u n="201" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="202" who="S0369" trans="overlap">like the media</u>
<u n="203" who="S0251">mm</u>

<u n="211" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="212" who="S0369">exactly that and <trunc>s</trunc>saying out costly it is to run</u>
<u n="213" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="214" who="S0369">and er and there is because it's <pause dur="short"/> it's er like government money shall we say</u>
<u n="215" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="216" who="S0369">for example don't forget when I first started work it was a private company</u>
<u n="217" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="218" who="S0369">with shareholders</u>
<u n="219" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="220" who="S0369">and it was called <anon type="miscPersonalInfo"/> and it had a number of bus companies of which <anon type="place"/> was one</u>
<u n="221" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="222" who="S0369">and we used to have directors' visits once maybe twice a year</u>

<u n="227" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="228" who="S0369">now then it became nationalised</u>
<u n="229" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="230" who="S0369">no shareholders really</u>
<u n="231" who="S0251">no</u>

<u n="2779" who="S0368">yeah</u>
<u n="2780" who="S0369">and it said that fracking has been banned and it named I think three countries</u>

<u n="2782" who="S0252">mm</u>
<u n="2783" who="S0369">I think Germany was one</u>

<u n="2785" who="S0369">where it's been banned no fracking in Germany er</u>
<u n="2786" who="S0252">I think France is another one</u>
<u n="2787" who="S0369" trans="overlap">two other places you know so you know they are but as I was saying to grandma about a month ago in Lincolnshire</u>
<u n="2788" who="S0252">mm</u>
<u n="2789" who="S0369">there was er an earthquake</u>

<u n="2794" who="S0252">on the Richter scale yeah</u>
<u n="2795" who="S0369">mm now then er in Lancashire er they was doing some fracking there</u>

<u n="2801" who="S0369">so that's <trunc>g</trunc> now then there's this one in Lincolnshire and I say three point four for this country is is er getting on the big side for us and of course it's not that far away from <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> just across <anon type="place"/> and you're there er so you know it's all like er er you know grist to the mill like isn't it?</u>
<u n="2802" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="2803" who="S0369">to say that er yes there is something in that business but you see at <anon type="place"/> they're saying we're not er er doing it they're just testing but the they're testing really for continuing</u>

<u n="2846" who="S0368" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="2847" who="S0369">mm and they started off on this tour <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> we did and they said anyone who had a breakfast of bacon and egg this morning it was fried on nuclear powered electricity</u>
<u n="2848" who="S0368"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2849" who="S0369">and er that was a really good stab at so you've had the benefit of nuclear power on your bacon and egg</u>
<u n="2850" who="S0252">mm mm</u>
<u n="2851" who="S0369">but what they're going to do and going to is er you know smaller nuclear stations er power stations all round and <pause dur="short"/> as I say er I know <pause dur="short"/> even in this atom bomb business I've been reading with er with er Churchill and going through they're on about fission and fusion</u>
<u n="2852" who="S0251">mm</u>

<u n="2855" who="S0369">was fusion</u>
<u n="2856" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="2857" who="S0369">and anyhow <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing with the and it's got you see it's got that bad reputation which it deserved</u>
<u n="2858" who="S0251">yeah</u>
<u n="2859" who="S0369">but there is another form of atomic power which is the as I say the fission er I think it's fission which doesn't have this these dangers</u>
<u n="2860" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="2861" who="S0369">but it's a little bit more difficult</u>
<u n="2862" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="2863" who="S0369">the they do it they can do it in a laboratory you know experimentally to demonstrate it but getting it to be up and running</u>
<u n="2864" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="2865" who="S0369">to put it into production for electricity is er just but it will come it will they will get it that way mm because electricity it's so we're dependent on it</u>

<u n="2891" who="S0369">and actually even in Margaret Thatcher's well even when they was making this bomb you're talking about wartime they realised then er that er <pause dur="short"/> coal was really outdated</u>

<u n="2893" who="S0369">you that that's why it it went out of favour cos we decided that that coal was just far too expensive and and one way or another er to be continue with coal meaning really for the railways</u>
