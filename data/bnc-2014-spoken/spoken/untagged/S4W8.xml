<u n="103" who="S0320">a couple <pause dur="short"/> that are siblings that come so there's a couple of older <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> kids that come as well but</u>
<u n="104" who="S0443"><unclear>right</unclear></u>

<u n="511" who="S0443">erm</u>
<u n="512" who="S0320">well I would imagine they'd accept <trunc>an</trunc> level three equivalent <pause dur="short"/> because all of them have</u>

<u n="514" who="S0320">got equivalents</u>
<u n="515" who="S0443">no <pause dur="short"/> there is only level three that's</u>

<u n="518" who="S0320">oh right okay</u>
<u n="519" who="S0443">it's a completely different system</u>
<u n="520" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="521" who="S0443">it's like <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>u</trunc> it's like baccalaureate <pause dur="short"/> and A levels</u>
