<u n="23" who="S0439">yeah she's just</u>
<u n="24" who="S0441">being weird</u>
<u n="25" who="S0439">being <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> oh well oh so what did you get up today? how was working from home?</u>
<u n="26" who="S0441">it was actually quite <pause dur="short"/> it only got stressful towards the end because I had to ring someone and sort something out <pause dur="short"/> then it sort of becomes stressful when you're not there to just go and talk to people</u>
<u n="27" who="S0439">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0441" trans="overlap">like to be fair that's what my jobs gonna be <unclear/> to the new routine so <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0439">really?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0441" trans="overlap">get used to it I suppose <pause dur="short"/> yeah so <pause dur="short"/> we'll see</u>
<u n="31" who="S0439">how many days are you gonna be working from home?</u>
<u n="32" who="S0441">dunno <pause dur="short"/> we haven't really got really a base so</u>
<u n="33" who="S0439">oh okay</u>
<u n="34" who="S0441">we have got a base but <pause dur="short"/> they're cutting down on as er <trunc>in</trunc>instead of cutting down on staff they're cutting down on paying for <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="35" who="S0439">rent</u>
<u n="36" who="S0441"><unclear/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0439">building yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0441">so there's gonna be like a team of sixty with space for twenty so there's not gonna be any room for anyone so we'll be working remotely quite a lot</u>
<u n="39" who="S0439">I guess as long as you do the job it doesn't matter where you work though does it? like</u>
<u n="40" who="S0441">it just makes it a lot <trunc>diff</trunc> more difficult when you haven't got people around you all the time</u>
<u n="41" who="S0439">mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0441">people that perhaps I don't know think that they can do it on their own and that that's where it could get a bit dangerous really</u>
<u n="43" who="S0439">I think monitoring people is gonna be dangerous</u>
<u n="44" who="S0441">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0439" trans="overlap">it's gonna be hard because at work yeah I do fuck about sometimes and do like online shopping or check the Daily Mail and stuff</u>
<u n="46" who="S0441">mm</u>
<u n="47" who="S0439">but I still do my work</u>
<u n="48" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0439">if I was at home I would think I could be so easily be like oh it's lunch break let's watch an episode on Netflix</u>
<u n="50" who="S0441">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0439">oh let's have another episode on Netflix</u>
<u n="52" who="S0441" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> have to be disciplined I suppose</u>
<u n="53" who="S0439">yeah you have to be really <trunc>di</trunc> it has to be a lot of self-discipline doesn't there?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0441">mm I suppose the difference is is that if I don't get something done then someone <pause dur="short"/> could <pause dur="short"/> be like harmed I suppose as</u>
<u n="55" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="56" who="S0441">as a result</u>
<u n="57" who="S0439">yeah</u>

<u n="59" who="S0439">yeah</u>

<u n="65" who="S0439">mm</u>
<u n="66" who="S0441">I'd imagine it would be so you'd probably fit all your <unclear/> for the first couple of days and then <pause dur="short"/> catch up with yourself in the weeks</u>
<u n="67" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0441" trans="overlap">in the days after probably</u>

<u n="84" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0439">building that relationship with people like and then I'm more likely to get something people are more likely to do something for you or you're more likely to do something for somebody else if you're there on the spot they come up to your desk they tell you to do it</u>
<u n="86" who="S0441">or they know you already</u>

<u n="349" who="S0441"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and while it's tempting to switch oo for ee the plural of moose is simply moose though you may occasionally see or hear the word mooses the confusion is understandable if you consider the word goose with the plural geese given that both animals that given that both are animals and that the two words in their singular forms rhyme with one another it's a bit confusing why they don't share a plural change as well so why don't we say meese?</u>
<u n="350" who="S0439">why don't we? do tell</u>

<u n="352" who="S0439">okay</u>
<u n="353" who="S0441">all remained unchanged in the plural it is also quite possible for the same noun to employ more than one of the above types of plural <trunc>formulat</trunc> formation the word moose has its origin in the native American <trunc>Anglo</trunc> Algonquian</u>
