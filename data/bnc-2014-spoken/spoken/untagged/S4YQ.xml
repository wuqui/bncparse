<u n="6" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0253">cos to me it seems like really straightforward and it's not time consuming</u>
<u n="8" who="S0254">I don't like it it's always just a faff and the bag rips and whatever and it stinks and take it outside</u>
<u n="9" who="S0253">that's why you invest in decent bin bags and then</u>
<u n="10" who="S0254">I know I thought they were the same ones as we bought last time but they're obviously not cos they're crap</u>
<u n="11" who="S0253">yeah</u>

<u n="13" who="S0253">it's not there's no one job I don't like doing for me it's more a case of like I hate I hate not feeling like I've got the energy to do things cos I like doing them I like getting things done I like tidying and I like cleaning and I like everything being nice you know</u>
<u n="14" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="15" who="S0253">it's crap but I hate when I feel like I've not got the energy or the time</u>
<u n="16" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0253">to do stuff which I don't like that that's what really bothers me I don't like that feeling of there'd be like washing up to do but I just feel like I'm too drained to do it</u>
<u n="18" who="S0254">mm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0253">awful at the moment <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah what about you</u>

<u n="23" who="S0253">that's not a job</u>
<u n="24" who="S0254">washing up don't like washing up I don't mind washing up clean stuff but I hate</u>
<u n="25" who="S0253">no one minds that</u>
<u n="26" who="S0254">you know like if there's not much on it it's just like you know barely any you know like knives and forks or a plate that you've eaten all the food off so it's pretty clean</u>
<u n="27" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0254">or it's like scraped but I hate cleaning cans and like dishes that you've put in the oven that you've put stuff in</u>
<u n="29" who="S0253">yeah but that's exactly the type of thing you always do and then you leave it cos you don't want to do it and then you make it and you'll be like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> made this squid carbonara in this dish it's pretty baked on</u>
<u n="30" who="S0254">a hundred dishes</u>
<u n="31" who="S0253">you'll have to really get your fingernails in there if you wanna get that</u>
<u n="32" who="S0254">that's what I hate</u>
<u n="33" who="S0253">that squid off</u>
<u n="34" who="S0254">that's why I'd rather've thrown that pan away than pick the scuz in it and clean it</u>
<u n="35" who="S0253">that was fine after like</u>
<u n="36" who="S0254">was it</u>
<u n="37" who="S0253">it took me about five minutes to do</u>
<u n="38" who="S0254">really</u>
<u n="39" who="S0253">you just had to get at it but yeah I know</u>
<u n="40" who="S0254">those two that I've left to soak but I've done your dad's trick of leaving them upside down and I'll do them before work tomorrow</u>
<u n="41" who="S0253">yeah you're thinking you've discovered gravity dad is like</u>
<u n="42" who="S0254">thought like</u>
<u n="43" who="S0253">but isn't it strange I know it sounds stupid</u>
<u n="44" who="S0254">never heard of it but it really does work</u>
<u n="45" who="S0253">but when you think about I know it sounds really stupid</u>
<u n="46" who="S0254">but yeah makes perfect sense</u>
<u n="47" who="S0253">when you think about like the force of gravity acting on anything</u>
<u n="48" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0253">it's gotta go down eventually</u>
<u n="50" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0253">I don't know what though cos when he told me that I was like don't be daft and I think I'd eaten a bowl of Weetabix which goes like concrete</u>
<u n="52" who="S0254"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah weld a house together with it</u>
<u n="53" who="S0253">I think I'd like left it in my room for like two days and then it was like you know proper rock rock solid to the bowl like it was like a big glass crockery bowl</u>
<u n="54" who="S0254">I'd had about eight Weetabix</u>
<u n="55" who="S0253">I used to love doing that erm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0254">Weetabix</u>
<u n="57" who="S0253">and then I got enough to satisfy my</u>
<u n="58" who="S0254">satisfy your craving all that milk's got to be eaten eaten drank</u>
<u n="59" who="S0253">drank erm and yeah and he's like I thought he was really annoyed at me and he's like here you are soak the sink get a bit of soap around the inside of it soften it up next day it was like it'd been in the dishwasher it was amazing</u>
<u n="60" who="S0254">that's good</u>
<u n="61" who="S0253">yeah what is this bloody advert it's like golf balls</u>
<u n="62" who="S0254">face looks like a golf ball</u>
<u n="63" who="S0253">is your face like a golf ball</u>
<u n="64" who="S0254"><vocal desc="laugh"/> use this make up and pout lots</u>
<u n="65" who="S0253">this is crazy have I seen what this this Rachel Riley advert did you know it's illegal to for celebrities to say things that are scientifically untrue I'm not sure whether it's just to do with health I think teeth might be okay cos she she's saying like toothpaste as if it like it's becoming sentient like hello <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I've noticed cavities in your mouth and when you see that advert</u>
<u n="66" who="S0254">I haven't really taken much notice of it to be honest</u>
<u n="67" who="S0253">it's like toothpaste with smart technology and it adapts</u>
<u n="68" who="S0254">that's ridiculous</u>
<u n="69" who="S0253">it's insane isn't it it's like the most nonsensical thing you've heard from an advert well not ever but apparently</u>
<u n="70" who="S0254">it's a Skechers</u>
<u n="71" who="S0253">they meant to like improve your</u>
<u n="72" who="S0254">there just like the world's most comfy shoes apparently but they look hideous</u>
<u n="73" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0254">mum and dads got a matching pair they've got his and hers sketchers</u>
<u n="75" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0254">totally sad</u>
<u n="77" who="S0253">and she was like she's trying to adapt she's trying to do it as it adapts to your mouth and it's like the most ridiculous thing and then I read this thing that apparently there was a sports player who said that it was like there's a pill that like blocks the fat absorption by your body</u>
<u n="78" who="S0254">oh yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0253">and that went to court and things like that but apparently you're not allowed to it's not true it's just not true</u>
<u n="80" who="S0254">adi osals <unclear/> or something</u>
<u n="81" who="S0253">there's these like fat pills this was years ago but he was like an amazingly bad baseball player and he was like come out with this he was on an advert and yeah you know he helped me keep the weight of it just categorically untrue but apparently it's illegal or against advertising regulations for that to happen so there must be ways round it like</u>
<u n="82" who="S0254">yeah there must be there must be like certain phrases</u>
<u n="83" who="S0253">it's not to do with like cosmetics cos on cosmetics adverts you see fake eyelashes and stuff</u>
<u n="84" who="S0254">come out with all sorts of rubbish on make-up adverts <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="85" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0254">the EU have banned certain Hoovers</u>
<u n="87" who="S0253">cos their energy consumption</u>
<u n="88" who="S0254">yeah you can't have a certain wattage of</u>
<u n="89" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0254">hoover and now they're thinking of bringing it in with hair-dryers and stuff like that</u>
<u n="91" who="S0253">was it your mum saying that like she was saying how you never think of it with hoover you just leave it running don't you like</u>
<u n="92" who="S0254">yeah yeah those energy saving things</u>
<u n="93" who="S0253">equivalent to leaving a tap on isn't it like even worse</u>
<u n="94" who="S0254">money just going down the drain</u>
<u n="95" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0254">literally</u>
<u n="97" who="S0253">yeah but no I don't like like I think I think when you're living with someone should divide I think you have to divide labour normally it just works out but if one person is doing everything and one person's doing nothing I think that's quite bad</u>
<u n="98" who="S0254">yeah and I don't mind and I think we kind of do it in quite a nice way when one of us is having a particularly crappy week the other one will step up and do a bit more and I sort of like that rather than this is your job you always do this it's like we both do everything and sometimes we do a little bit more or less depending on our feeling</u>
<u n="99" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0254">but I quite like that</u>
<u n="101" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0254">I don't feel like cooking is my job and I have to do it</u>
<u n="103" who="S0253">I know occasionally make sandwiches for me but I couldn't stand it if I was like made sandwiches I just think that would be horrible I just don't know it's weird or like where's my tea</u>
<u n="104" who="S0254">yeah I've got your dinner on the table for when you come in be awful wouldn't it <event desc="sound of tv"/> what I don't know I like you like making tea and tidying up and stuff but I think I feel guilty</u>
<u n="105" who="S0253">why?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0254">cos I feel like you always have lots more to do than me</u>
<u n="107" who="S0253">I haven't really I've not</u>
<u n="108" who="S0254">just feel like I should do it because I have my evenings and you don't</u>
<u n="109" who="S0253">to be honest I mean maybe that was like true a few months ago but now like I really don't have much to do like tonight I just printed some stuff off and that was it it was really</u>
<u n="110" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0253">I can't think of the last time I spent a couple of weeks ago I spent a couple of hours doing work like in an evening I've just been I wouldn't say lazy but I've just started to rest on my laurels a bit</u>
<u n="112" who="S0254">yeah I think you deserve to like that's the bonus of you know having worked somewhere so long and put in the time in previously then you can reap the reward of that</u>
<u n="113" who="S0253">yeah I don't know I feel but It's kind of boring me cos I'm using the same stuff again and again so I kind of need to kind of shake up my own lessons</u>
<u n="114" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0253">think I'm going to watch a bit of Thank You For Smoking do like a lesson on advertising or something</u>
<u n="116" who="S0254">that's a good idea</u>
<u n="117" who="S0253">it's a bit more interesting isn't it</u>
<u n="118" who="S0254">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="119" who="S0253">did we go to the cinema to see that</u>
<u n="120" who="S0254">did we go to the fact?</u>
<u n="121" who="S0253">I think we did</u>
<u n="122" who="S0254">I think we did yeah good film I haven't been to the pictures for ages not much on really summer's always been a bit of a</u>
<u n="123" who="S0253">bit of a weird one isn't it? cos</u>
<u n="124" who="S0254">a down time</u>
<u n="125" who="S0253"><trunc>th</trunc> I think there was loadsa good films at the start of this year there was like loads of brilliant films and then</u>
<u n="126" who="S0254"><vocal desc="laugh"/> did you watch this with me the other day?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0253">I think I think this was on TV last night are you <unclear>onto</unclear> the Burger King adverts with Richard Blackwood?</u>

<u n="130" who="S0254">no</u>
<u n="131" who="S0253">he was a presenter for MTV and he's I dunno he he's I <trunc>rea</trunc></u>
<u n="132" who="S0254"><unclear/></u>
<u n="133" who="S0253">I really liked him he was when I he was on like this show called TRL which was called Total Request Live do you remember that?</u>
<u n="134" who="S0254">no</u>
<u n="135" who="S0253">and it was <trunc>basi</trunc></u>
<u n="136" who="S0254">I never used to have Sky or MTV or anything like that</u>
<u n="137" who="S0253">it was on MTV and it was basically like erm in the States it was quite famous and it was in it was I think it was in like Madison Square Garden where the studio was or something and people would stand outside outside a glass window all day and then have celebrities on and then they'd play music videos and people would call in and request</u>
<u n="138" who="S0254"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="139" who="S0253">just erm like that very sort of late nineties early</u>
<u n="140" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0253">millennia and then erm and then we had</u>
<u n="142" who="S0254">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0253">it over here I think it was TRL and he hosted it and I remember it being er being really funny but and he was kind of tipped for big things and then he did like and then he had this single and it got to like number three in the charts and it was like you know he was establishing himself</u>
<u n="144" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0253">and his and then I dunno what happened I I I had to read up on him yesterday cos I I saw him on a Burger King advert and I was a bit annoyed</u>
<u n="146" who="S0254"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it's like what are you doing there?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0253">but he literally disappeared and he's not like a celebrity that had like a drug scandal or had like you know any kind of scandal really it was basically a series of like just poor decisions like by his management or something like that so</u>
<u n="148" who="S0254">oh that's just that's sad</u>
<u n="149" who="S0253">he he had his er his <trunc>al</trunc> er so he had like his number three single and then it was like number twenty-three</u>
<u n="150" who="S0254">huh</u>
<u n="151" who="S0253">then it was number forty-five like his his third track off the album the album bombed</u>
<u n="152" who="S0254">oh</u>
<u n="153" who="S0253">and then he did and then he did some TV show and I think it I think it's what happens sometimes is like when you're in TV it's like say you're on huh say you say take like Jon Richardson for example who has probably gained a lot of popularity from this show</u>
<u n="154" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0253">then he'll probably get offers to do like you know a <trunc>ch</trunc> like his own talk show or something like that eventually but</u>
<u n="156" who="S0254">oh god <unclear/></u>
<u n="157" who="S0253">you've got to <unclear/> cos if they go badly then you're kind of in trouble</u>

<u n="242" who="S0254">yeah I know</u>
<u n="243" who="S0253">I remember them being in the Argos catalogue in nineteen ninety-six</u>

<u n="245" who="S0253">god I could I could draw you everything in that catalogue I just</u>
<u n="246" who="S0254">oh I loved that that's the thing about car boot sales like it is quite heartbreaking cos it's all the stuff that you used to like love and the stuff that you saved up loads of money for or the stuff that you begged for at Christmas and now obviously you have no use for it you don't want it but the thought that then somebody haggles from haggles you from a pound to fifty P and you're like when I bought that that was like thirty quid like we sold my two erm china dolls do you remember them?</u>
<u n="247" who="S0253">yeah they're terrifying</u>
<u n="248" who="S0254">yeah yeah quite creepy yeah but I had two and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had one and like I begged and begged and begged for those china dolls for</u>
<u n="249" who="S0253">they remind me of something</u>
<u n="250" who="S0254">for ages</u>
<u n="251" who="S0253">like out of a goosebumps</u>
<u n="252" who="S0254">I know they were creepy but I really liked them and then I think I finally got them for my birthday off my nan or something</u>
<u n="253" who="S0253">do you mean do you mean the one that's like in the cupboard</u>
<u n="254" who="S0254">I sold it it's come back</u>
<u n="255" who="S0253">it's in the cupboard</u>
<u n="256" who="S0254">oh</u>
<u n="257" who="S0253">opened the cupboard the other day and it's head rotated <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="258" who="S0254">but yeah like I sold it to these two like I think they're maybe eastern European definitely anyway and we're like I was like three pound for the two of them and they're like mm oh no no I said two pounds each and they said we'll give you three pounds for the two of them and I was like for goodness sake they were so expensive when I bought then or got given them</u>
<u n="259" who="S0253">but don't sell them then</u>
<u n="260" who="S0254">yeah I know but you don't want them anymore</u>
<u n="261" who="S0253">don't back down</u>
<u n="262" who="S0254">do you</u>
<u n="263" who="S0253">yeah but that's the point that's if you if you if you were basically wearing a sign and you're at a significant disadvantage at haggling cos you're British and you're just too polite</u>
<u n="264" who="S0254">yeah the thing with those car boot is that no one actually wants anything so they'll be like how much do you want for this and you'll say two pound then they'll be like with you give us will you take a quid and then you say no it's two pounds and they'll just put it down and walk away so then you end up going home with everything</u>
<u n="265" who="S0253">but it's just not I mean it's you know it's just not part of our culture the idea of like bargaining it's like when we were in China</u>
<u n="266" who="S0254">no people do in car boot sales</u>
<u n="267" who="S0253">yeah I'm sure they do but it's like Shepherd just text me before I text him about Turkey and cos he goes there a lot and he said erm I don't know but I'll read you the text in a bit and tell you what he said but he said just a word of advice try not to be too don't be cos you said you will get people trying to sell everything to you</u>
<u n="268" who="S0254">oh yeah that's what my auntie said don't touch anything unless you're buying it</u>
<u n="269" who="S0253">erm and he just said try to be a bit less English about things don't think that you owe just by virtue of being in a shop you owe them a sale and things like that</u>
<u n="270" who="S0254">oh I'm not like that anyway</u>
<u n="271" who="S0253">I am bloody Hugh Grant I'm so terribly confused erm but you know I think with car boot sales I think if people know if people know that you if people know that you course you're dying to get rid of it no one wants crap in the house</u>
<u n="272" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="273" who="S0253">then you know I think we're such a wasteful culture as well that we sort of become burdened by the things we buy like property and all our crap and people know you want to get rid of it so people low ball you don't you</u>
<u n="274" who="S0254">that's why</u>
<u n="275" who="S0253">I think you if you just hung on a bit longer</u>
<u n="276" who="S0254">I just don't think you would some stuff you know that people would want but like china dolls really who wants then</u>
<u n="277" who="S0253">especially haunted ones</u>
<u n="278" who="S0254">exactly but then she got them and she stuffed them into her ruck sack I was like be careful you're going to like smash her face</u>
<u n="279" who="S0253">need to watch this episode of the American Office where Dwight he starts off with a paper clip and he's like and there's a telescope someone's someone's selling a telescope that's just snapped one of your balls</u>
<u n="280" who="S0254">loom bands things</u>
<u n="281" who="S0253">yeah erm and he starts off with like a paper-clip and the Schrutes are excellent hagglers by the end of the day I'll walk away with the most expensive item here so what he does is it's like a series of trades it's like you know he obviously uses a bit of conniving in places so it just kind of goes from a paper clip to a candle a candle to what else like some crappy jewellery and he sort of plays on people's sentiments to sell them everything and it's just really good and that's what I always think when you say to me that people really really low ball you for pieces of crap like haggling over ten pence</u>
<u n="282" who="S0254">yeah it's really ridiculous</u>
<u n="283" who="S0253">but it's because I don't know maybe and then you said you saw something on another table didn't you what was it</u>
<u n="284" who="S0254">a clock but then you just dunno sometimes I think like I'd rather just take it all to a charity shop cos probably charity shops sell it for more money but the I don't know if they'd sell half the crap they we actually sold I don't know</u>
<u n="285" who="S0253">you read about people who throw change away</u>
<u n="286" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="287" who="S0253">they literally throw money in the bin</u>
<u n="288" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="289" who="S0253">as opposed to metaphorically throwing in the bin can you throw money in the bin metaphorically?</u>
<u n="290" who="S0254">like money going down the drain</u>
<u n="291" who="S0253">that's the one but erm yeah like I think that's the thing we just</u>
<u n="292" who="S0254">actually that's why I'd like to go to a car boot sale if we like bought a house or something or you were furnishing somewhere I would like to go to a car boot sale to be on the other end cos sometimes people do get rid of half decent stuff and I suppose then when people know it's half decent they're like yeah I dunno maybe I'm just rubbish at it cos we're keen to get rid of stuff but</u>
<u n="293" who="S0253">need to do some NLP something like that and get rid of negotiations</u>
<u n="294" who="S0254">yeah laughs</u>
<u n="295" who="S0253">find if you don't want it you don't want it be able to know</u>
<u n="296" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="297" who="S0253">that's what NLP's for isn't it</u>
<u n="298" who="S0254">I dunno</u>
<u n="299" who="S0253">that's what they use it</u>
<u n="300" who="S0254">linguistic programming</u>
<u n="301" who="S0253">linguistic programming isn't it like to tune into people's body language on a really like terrifying level I'm always confused cos people always talk about NLP</u>
<u n="302" who="S0254">I don't know what I thought it was it's always Groupon vouchers for it cos it's probably like some assertiveness training or something</u>
<u n="303" who="S0253">I read a book in Waterstones and it was I'm sure it was like NLP in business and it was it's basically about how to negotiate with people and how to form in a very strange way quite a robotic way how to form better business relationships with people basically if people seems a bit stand offish you're tuned into this so you can make the right moves and say the right things that would kind of warm them up yeah the day you need a book to tell you how to read people</u>
<u n="304" who="S0254">stupid eh</u>
<u n="305" who="S0253">yeah erm car boot sales are not not are not will never be my</u>
<u n="306" who="S0254">your forte</u>

<u n="365" who="S0253">why</u>
<u n="366" who="S0254">cos it's like if you nick a phone just put it on this website and you get like a hundred quid for it</u>
<u n="367" who="S0253">Ebay</u>
<u n="368" who="S0254">well yeah I suppose the only deals it</u>

<u n="370" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="371" who="S0253">the person receiving it has no I mean I guess they in a way cos not only receiving stealing stolen goods is a crime</u>
<u n="372" who="S0254">but yeah how would you know</u>
<u n="373" who="S0253">the point is</u>
<u n="374" who="S0254">the idea is you wouldn't have a charger would you</u>
<u n="375" who="S0253">you could say it was misrepresented you know it was represented as a new it's a not like running into a pub and saying do you want to buy a watch and like dancing until you buy it it's you know its basic case of like here's a picture of a phone that looks like a billion others that were produced with it you know and that's the thing there's no culpability then for people buying stolen goods cos how were they to know they're stolen oh well on the website they said it was fine</u>
<u n="376" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="377" who="S0253">whereas when it happens face to face</u>
<u n="378" who="S0254">you'd be suspicious if it didn't have a charger wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="379" who="S0253">happened to me remember</u>

<u n="386" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="387" who="S0253">I don't know and it took about three weeks to arrive so presumably they had to</u>
<u n="388" who="S0254">steal it to order</u>
<u n="389" who="S0253">I don't know what happened there but I paid well over the odds for it I think</u>
<u n="390" who="S0254">say when you bought it I was like why on earth did you do that</u>
<u n="391" who="S0253">cos I just wanted the same phone I didn't want like I liked that phone</u>

<u n="419" who="S0253">you can get apps to do stuff like that but honestly Iphones are like are like in your leagues ahead of the competition cos they've got the sort of the components down really well I've had that phone three years</u>
<u n="420" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="421" who="S0253">I mean okay I've dropped it and smashed the screen but other than that I mean that's a decent bit of kit really they're just quality products I guess</u>
<u n="422" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0253">but I think the assumption is with other phones just it could be me but I've never known anyone to have like a software problem with an Iphone or like an internal problem it's always like they're dropped them</u>
<u n="424" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="425" who="S0253">or got whereas like Samsungs always seem to have like little</u>
<u n="426" who="S0254">glitches</u>
<u n="427" who="S0253">little glitches but you know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s is amazing it's like it just really beautiful the screen like you it's really really posh</u>
<u n="428" who="S0254">HD and</u>
<u n="429" who="S0253">yeah but I just think the more pretty and twiddly it is the more you're gonna be inclined to whip it out every five seconds</u>
<u n="430" who="S0254">yeah more likely it is for someone to nick it</u>
<u n="431" who="S0253">yeah <event desc="sound of tv"/> <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="432" who="S0254">mm</u>
<u n="433" who="S0253">I don't know like I feel more like I dunno like I think lately they've been talking more about crime and I feel really like sort of nervous</u>
<u n="434" who="S0254">what we have?</u>
<u n="435" who="S0253">yeah well like I was talking who was talking to the other day about like getting bag snatched?</u>
<u n="436" who="S0254">oh me</u>
<u n="437" who="S0253">you and then I was talking I can't remember I was talking to someone else about it and people kept telling me things you know and it was like oh yeah and saw <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> get his bike robbed</u>
<u n="438" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="439" who="S0253">it's not that you become I'm not more afraid of crime or anything like that you're just aware of how casually how at ease you are when you are in surroundings your own and your comfort zone</u>
<u n="440" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="441" who="S0253">like I kind of think of my little between here and work my little place</u>
<u n="442" who="S0254">yeah familiarity</u>
<u n="443" who="S0253">but it's not is it</u>
<u n="444" who="S0254">nope</u>
<u n="445" who="S0253">belongs to a lot of people</u>
<u n="446" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="447" who="S0253">but you just don't think that like you know you were saying that one in Asda</u>
<u n="448" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="449" who="S0253">Asda's not somewhere I think I'd get robbed</u>
<u n="450" who="S0254">yeah I mean you wander around in a world of your own in Asda and you can see exactly what had happened like they'd probably left their handbag on the side of the trolley and just nipped off slightly away from their trolley to just grab something</u>
<u n="451" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="452" who="S0254">and he's just stuck his hand in and just pinched</u>
<u n="453" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="454" who="S0254">pinched her purse</u>
<u n="455" who="S0253">it's quite funny though cos I think I guess not being a thief you wouldn't if I saw someone do that I probably wouldn't think in Asda I wouldn't think that stupid nor would I think I'm going to rob it cos it's just not in my mind</u>
<u n="456" who="S0254">no course not I probably would think you should be careful with that</u>
<u n="457" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="458" who="S0254">but I don't know yeah you could probably do that loads of times and be okay couldn't you</u>
<u n="459" who="S0253">yeah see if you walk around town with like or sit in a cafe with Macbooks</u>
<u n="460" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="461" who="S0253">you're essentially walking around with</u>
<u n="462" who="S0254">a thousand pounds</u>
<u n="463" who="S0253">some of them are more some of the Macbooks proper Macbooks are fifteen hundred quid and you just that's everyone its not like it's something that nobody would notice and nobody would know the value of</u>
<u n="464" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="465" who="S0253">it's so simple to just to like</u>
<u n="466" who="S0254">everyone knows a Macbook is worth a lot</u>
<u n="467" who="S0253">yeah but it's so easy again in a smaller city to feel at home and so oh I've only gotta walk to the cash machine yeah it just I never knew where De Montfort was</u>
<u n="468" who="S0254">yeah I don't know if I did I knew it was kind of round that way</u>
<u n="469" who="S0253">kind of pointless this question like can you name two universities in Leicester</u>
<u n="470" who="S0254"><unclear/> <event desc="sound of tv"/></u>
<u n="471" who="S0253">can help slimming as part of calorie controlled diet</u>
<u n="472" who="S0254">calorie controlled diet</u>
<u n="473" who="S0253">basically means like</u>
<u n="474" who="S0254">cos like mum's friend she used to take those tablets and she used to eat like chocolate cake and stuff and she used to like completely mess her body up because you're not you're like those things stop your body from erm taking in the fat don't they stops your body from digesting the fat so you're not supposed to eat any fat high calorie stuff cos if you do it just gives you the comes straight out and it makes you really ill</u>
<u n="475" who="S0253">it's so weird</u>
<u n="476" who="S0254">nasty</u>
<u n="477" who="S0253">yeah I sort of really I don't know my metabolism will change in a few years but</u>
<u n="478" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="479" who="S0253">I sort of feel really grateful I don't have to it's not like I don't have to worry about what I eat it will become more of an issue but it I'm just glad its never been there something that's always been in the back of my mind</u>
<u n="480" who="S0254">battling with it</u>
<u n="481" who="S0253">I've got lots of friends who just feel like not in a bad way I never really like I've questioned what I've eaten cos it's disgusting in a doner kebab but like a doner meat on a pizza I've questioned the health problems of it</u>
<u n="482" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="483" who="S0253">but you know never been like kind of oh I'm scared I'll either put weight on or I'll have to balance it out with something else I feel really very grateful for that</u>
<u n="484" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="485" who="S0253">my mums still going to that thing</u>
<u n="486" who="S0254">oh is she good how's she finding it?</u>
<u n="487" who="S0253">erm</u>
<u n="488" who="S0254">did you say she was aching the other day</u>
<u n="489" who="S0253">she was aching but that's only a good thing isn't it</u>
<u n="490" who="S0254">yeah definitely I mean she's doing it right</u>
<u n="491" who="S0253">I'm really tough with give it up immediately never go back but I think she knows how important it is</u>
<u n="492" who="S0254">yeah doing good</u>
<u n="493" who="S0253">yeah <event desc="sound of tv"/></u>
<u n="494" who="S0254">has she said much about it like there's many people in her class what they do or</u>
<u n="495" who="S0253">no I need to properly speak to her about it really yeah I just think it's brilliant</u>
<u n="496" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="497" who="S0253">what were you saying before about those e-cigarettes like that's what you were saying the other day but for them I'm not sure my parents would've quit smoking</u>
<u n="498" who="S0254">they've done so well</u>
<u n="499" who="S0253">yeah well</u>
<u n="500" who="S0254">feel like they've made loads of lifestyle changes since you've moved out I sort of think</u>
<u n="501" who="S0253">stress of living with me</u>
<u n="502" who="S0254">no no no you can nag at people can't you and like tell them to do more of this don't eat that and stuff and it comes from a really good place and you don't mean it to sound naggy but then when you're not there any it's almost like you're not going to do that cos they're telling me to do it all the time</u>
<u n="503" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="504" who="S0254">and then when you're suddenly not there telling them everyday it's kinda sunk in now and they've done something about it</u>
<u n="505" who="S0253">I think that's like I think that's with a lot of things I feel like when someone telling you to do something comes part of your routine you won't do it</u>
<u n="506" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="507" who="S0253">it's only and then it's once that person leaves you to your own devices you realise the benefits of them</u>
<u n="508" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="509" who="S0253">whereas if someone's nagging you you get annoyed with that person all you think they're telling me to do this cos they're a pain in the arse</u>
<u n="510" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="511" who="S0253">rather than like they you know this will benefit me</u>
<u n="512" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="513" who="S0253">that's definitely my mindset I think I never listen to advice until like</u>
<u n="514" who="S0254">your own advice</u>
<u n="515" who="S0253">and then once I can kind of say under my own volition</u>
<u n="516" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="517" who="S0253">but erm yeah they have they've done quite well so they so though I mean they talked about the shopping the other day and the freezer they've got two freezers and they're both full</u>
<u n="518" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="519" who="S0253">and then do like oh we've got to go to Aldi and I didn't say anything I was like oh fair enough and then dad was like we have to though cos we've got two freezers full of food but what it is because they will cook they will eat the most quickest most convenient things first you know things that take like things that you actually move from one place to another</u>
<u n="520" who="S0254">putting the on a baking tray</u>
<u n="521" who="S0253">but even like frozen food that takes a bit longer they're not interested in and I was just sort saying about you and how good you are at you know just making the best of what you've got</u>
<u n="522" who="S0254">that's from my nan</u>
<u n="523" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="524" who="S0254">she used to make something with everything she'd save like the tiniest bit of left overs and make stuff</u>
<u n="525" who="S0253">make a lobby I bet your lobby was like</u>
<u n="526" who="S0254">lobby she used to like you know when you just have a few peas at the bottom of buying frozen peas or frozen veg</u>
<u n="527" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="528" who="S0254">you know you don't wanna use you end up with a little bit at the end cos it's not enough for one person but it would have been too much to so you end up with a little bit she used to save all of those bits at the bottom of the bag and when she'd had enough she used to make a soup out of it</u>
<u n="529" who="S0253">go away</u>
<u n="530" who="S0254">it's just like</u>
<u n="531" who="S0253">how'd you make a soup out of</u>
<u n="532" who="S0254">I don't know out of frozen veg I don't know but she did but she'd like never ever waste anything</u>
<u n="533" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="534" who="S0254">and it's just because you know she had eight people to feed and like she was brought up on rations and</u>
<u n="535" who="S0253">bacon oh rashers</u>
<u n="536" who="S0254">wartime rations you know and she had eight people</u>
<u n="537" who="S0253">that's the term isn't it rations rations of bacon</u>
<u n="538" who="S0254">and she had eight people to feed and they didn't have much money so everything you know she used to have to make stuff go far and go you know never ever any any waste ever</u>
<u n="539" who="S0253">that's good</u>
<u n="540" who="S0254">whereas like my other nan's like let it rot in the freezer it's fine oh</u>
<u n="541" who="S0253">if the police would've raided your nan's I think they would thought she's murdered someone and put them in the freezer it's just like joints tail</u>
<u n="542" who="S0254">I wonder if the next door cat went</u>
<u n="543" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="544" who="S0254">oh no I spoke to her before I was like dad got there safe she's like cool thanks for letting me know</u>
<u n="545" who="S0253">she fretting about him</u>
<u n="546" who="S0254">erm she seems okay actually <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> took her out in the wheelchair today</u>
<u n="547" who="S0253">who's <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>

<u n="555" who="S0253">bet he's amazing at like computer games though</u>
<u n="556" who="S0254">yeah he loves computer games</u>
<u n="557" who="S0253">really I was just messing is he actually</u>
<u n="558" who="S0254">yeah erm</u>
<u n="559" who="S0253">all the clichÃ©s</u>
<u n="560" who="S0254">and then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is the youngest who had the baby at sixteen</u>
<u n="561" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="562" who="S0254">and then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is kind of like the normal one with a psychology degree is a social worker in Bristol</u>
<u n="563" who="S0253">it's mad how kids can go in so many different ways isn't it</u>
<u n="564" who="S0254">yeah I mean I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> got learning difficulties</u>
<u n="565" who="S0253">right</u>
<u n="566" who="S0254">erm</u>
<u n="567" who="S0253">you have mentioned before have I met him</u>
<u n="568" who="S0254">might have done you will've done at Christmas</u>
<u n="569" who="S0253">that when I came round</u>
<u n="570" who="S0254">when you came round to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> yeah but apart from that I don't see them I only see them at Christmas but yeah he cos he doesn't get regular work he just does like gardening like landscaping erm</u>
<u n="571" who="S0253">so what do you mean he's got learning difficulties</u>
<u n="572" who="S0254">well it's never been diagnosed but his like his writing's really bad he doesn't put capital letters on his name just stuff like that and like he's nearly forty and still live at home and</u>
<u n="573" who="S0253">so he's got like dyspraxia or something</u>
<u n="574" who="S0254">yeah I think that's what probably dyslexia there and I think I dunno I don't really know what it is I don't think there is anything major it just seems like kind of a mild learning difficulty but</u>
<u n="575" who="S0253">does dyslexia like obviously it impairs your linguistic abilities</u>
<u n="576" who="S0254">er dyslexia?</u>
<u n="577" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="578" who="S0254">no it's just your erm writing</u>
<u n="579" who="S0253">okay</u>
<u n="580" who="S0254">and your reading</u>
<u n="581" who="S0253">but does it effect you in any other way?</u>
<u n="582" who="S0254">no don't think so</u>
<u n="583" who="S0253">okay</u>
<u n="584" who="S0254">just your perception of letters isn't it</u>
<u n="585" who="S0253">so it's like</u>
<u n="586" who="S0254">it's a really like</u>
<u n="587" who="S0253">so it doesn't effect like your social skills or anything</u>
<u n="588" who="S0254">no no no it's really specific thing dyslexia</u>
<u n="589" who="S0253">I notice it more and more in my students but then it's obviously like it's I've started to like I had a dyslexic I think had a dyslexic student a while ago but it's not my place you know</u>
<u n="590" who="S0254">no</u>
<u n="591" who="S0253">can you imagine someone saying to you <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> your Arabic lessons are going terribly why can't you write in perfect Arabic script and it's</u>
<u n="592" who="S0254">but it's not</u>
<u n="593" who="S0253">it's not</u>
<u n="594" who="S0254">unless they were Arabic I suppose then that would be understandable</u>
<u n="595" who="S0253">no</u>
<u n="596" who="S0254">but if you're Spanish and you're struggling and you getting your Bs and Ds mixed up there's no reason for that in terms of broad language</u>
<u n="597" who="S0253">well</u>
<u n="598" who="S0254">cos they have Bs and Ds in Spanish so</u>
<u n="599" who="S0253">yeah but</u>
<u n="600" who="S0254">you shouldn't get that confused</u>
<u n="601" who="S0253">but our printed the way we pronounce words is so different to Spanish and Italian the way words are written in Spanish is how they sound</u>
<u n="602" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="603" who="S0253">whereas we have through cough enough</u>
<u n="604" who="S0254">yeah but if people are just mixing up their Bs and Ds and Ps</u>
<u n="605" who="S0253">that's that's when you notice it</u>
<u n="606" who="S0254">that's like the obvious that's kind of the typical sign isn't it I'm sure there's loads of other things</u>
<u n="607" who="S0253">yeah like that was the thing it was basically with writing it was honestly sometimes it was Ds backwards and things like that and erm but that's I mean that's really not my place to say to them</u>
<u n="608" who="S0254">no</u>
<u n="609" who="S0253">cos I can't it's like you were saying teachers aren't trained to</u>
<u n="610" who="S0254">they are</u>
<u n="611" who="S0253">but in school it's like</u>
<u n="612" who="S0254">yeah they can have a guess but it's still need to refer someone if you do ever get someone though you could cos it's stuff like reading they struggle to read cos all the letters get blurry</u>
<u n="613" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="614" who="S0254">and mixed up</u>
<u n="615" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="616" who="S0254">but printing on different colour paper</u>
<u n="617" who="S0253">well</u>
<u n="618" who="S0254">helps sort of like pink or blue or green</u>
<u n="619" who="S0253">what I started doing cos it happened where I felt maybe when I had less experience I would've noticed it and probably thought it was something to do with whatever I you might see someone for two weeks three weeks and then they disappear again so you never really know how they develop but there's this one guy in I just he was with us for a while so what I started to do was erm a lot of text like set text you can like like sort of graded reading you can you can actually download from most publisher's websites in</u>
<u n="620" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="621" who="S0253">like dyslexics friendly</u>
<u n="622" who="S0254">oh</u>
<u n="623" who="S0253">so like different colours bigger print larger print erm so we downloaded as many of them as we could and we just bought some coloured paper and green is meant to be good</u>
<u n="624" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="625" who="S0253">like green paper and yellow paper apparently what's the worst one white on black's not the worst there's another combination of colours that makes it really bad</u>
<u n="626" who="S0254">don't know</u>
<u n="627" who="S0253">but erm yeah so like we did that for them and stuff</u>
<u n="628" who="S0254">that's good cos a lot of people who are dyslexic have coloured overlays so they'll have like a green piece of acetate</u>
<u n="629" who="S0253">yeah acetate</u>
<u n="630" who="S0254">that they just lay over and then</u>
<u n="631" who="S0253">my friend at school <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he was I mean must have had it quite bad erm so teachers used to write it on the board in green erm for him and the he erm used to have these glasses and they were like you know like green lenses</u>
<u n="632" who="S0254">oh</u>
<u n="633" who="S0253">and they made like so when he was I think he used to wear them quite a lot cos they looked quite cool well the matrix had just come out at the time so wearing sort of black sunglasses dark dark almost sunglasses was pretty cool but he had to wear them like I think when we were younger we didn't really understand why</u>
<u n="634" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="635" who="S0253">I got why he was wearing but how they helped but I understand it bit more now but must be so hard it's like both <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> are dyslexic</u>
<u n="636" who="S0254">are they</u>
<u n="637" who="S0253">yeah just you know in <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> case it's clear to see this is someone who is really intelligent held back by</u>
<u n="638" who="S0254">yeah but their ability to read to write</u>
<u n="639" who="S0253">such an avid reader though he reads</u>
<u n="640" who="S0254">that's really good</u>
<u n="641" who="S0253">doesn't let anything out him off just reads and reads and reads</u>
<u n="642" who="S0254">that's good</u>
<u n="643" who="S0253">suppose shouldn't take it for granted should you</u>
<u n="644" who="S0254">definitely not</u>
<u n="645" who="S0253">must be quite hard</u>
<u n="646" who="S0254">definitely so it amazes me how specific some difficulties can be like specific parts of your brain that do really specific things</u>
<u n="647" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="648" who="S0254">and then like weird little things we can have er deficit in naming something but you know what it is you just can't name it you can't see moving pictures or</u>
<u n="649" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="650" who="S0254">like Oliver Sacks type stuff</u>
<u n="651" who="S0253">yeah it's erm it's hard to comprehend really but I suppose that's the brain for you isn't it so much going on well not in mind I'm told but it makes you wonder doesn't it like how at what point like what's the normal at what point do you stop seeing do you then take into account everyone's kind of sort of</u>
<u n="652" who="S0254">variation</u>
<u n="653" who="S0253">like linguistics some people just seem to be better some are better</u>
<u n="654" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="655" who="S0253">numerically</u>
<u n="656" who="S0254">and you have like a there's like a bell curve which is two standard deviations either side of the norm which is okay and if you're outside of two standard deviations then you're then it's like impair or you know you're classed as having a difficulty that's how they cut it off cos obviously there is massive variation between people but it's how much is too much variation and too standard deviation</u>
<u n="657" who="S0253">you know people say like I'm a maths person or I'm better at like numbers than I am with words</u>
<u n="658" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="659" who="S0253">do you ever think it's just a reluctance to develop the other skill</u>
<u n="660" who="S0254">yeah sometimes but I'm not I'm say I'm better with numbers than I am with words that's probably not true any more cos I haven't done maths for a long time but I prefer maths to like writing essays</u>
<u n="661" who="S0253">but you're really good at writing though</u>
<u n="662" who="S0254">don't really enjoy it I can write like a scientific report cos it's scientific and it's fact I don't like if you ask me to sit down and write a story it would be the most amateurish thing you've seen any kind of like creative writing</u>
<u n="663" who="S0253">that doesn't stop everyone</u>
<u n="664" who="S0254">or like an article or something I couldn't write anything like that I've tried it's just really boring try to write for BPS and it was just like that's really lame but then I think a lack of confidence is related cos you do read some stuff and think like that's utter rubbish people submit it and it gets published but then I just think</u>
<u n="665" who="S0253">there's obviously</u>
<u n="666" who="S0254">rubbish cos people see my name against it</u>
<u n="667" who="S0254">and a lot of like publications it's that thing between quality and content and sometimes the content's great it doesn't really matter how it's written hence the tabloid press like they get obviously I mean it doesn't mean how it comes out if there's a juicy bit of fact or juicy bit of controversial information then you know often it just gets put out regardless of you know the writing but then sometimes you just feel it now cos I read so much more than I used to and I read a lot of different stuff I can really I'm not like you know I'm not very critical of it but I know when I've read something that I don't think is put together very well or I think it's really weirdly written like that you do become better at it</u>
<u n="668" who="S0254">yeah <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="669" who="S0253">but to go I always say to myself oh number and things like that I guess if I sat down and tried to do some maths it would be okay</u>
<u n="670" who="S0254">yeah your mental arithmetic is better than mine</u>
<u n="671" who="S0253">no it's not I see numbers as a series of blocks</u>
<u n="672" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="673" who="S0253">and those fit together</u>
<u n="674" who="S0254">well it's kind of it really</u>
<u n="675" who="S0253">I don't know did you see that thing who was like a six year old maths genius how do you why is it you enjoy maths and he's like cos it just makes sense</u>
<u n="676" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="677" who="S0253">it's like I just don't understand maths on that level</u>
<u n="678" who="S0254">yeah long <pause dur="short"/> <event desc="sound of tv"/></u>
