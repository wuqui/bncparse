<u n="530" who="S0653">I think you've done a very very good job there cos it does really look like marble and that pattern will stay <pause dur="short"/> in the cake</u>
<u n="531" who="S0654">oh mum there's bits which are not mixed</u>
<u n="532" who="S0653">no but that's fine because the point of you look at the cake that's er the the one that's baked in the <trunc>pi</trunc> the photograph</u>
<u n="533" who="S0654">mm</u>
<u n="534" who="S0653">the marbling isn't done all the way through because that will just be too much <pause dur="short"/> this is what it looks like</u>

<u n="540" who="S0653">okay so the cake is cooled now and now we're going to need to do part one of the icing <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> don't muck around with the golden syrup so what we need to do is <pause dur="short"/> we need to melt the chocolate butter and golden syrup</u>
<u n="541" who="S0655"><vocal desc="gasp"/> that sounds tasty</u>
<u n="542" who="S0653">yeah stand there</u>

<u n="547" who="S0655"><vocal desc="gasp"/></u>
<u n="548" who="S0653">and honestly it's one of the best icings ever erm but that means that obviously it is going to be <pause dur="short"/> heated so we're going to make it ice sort of melting everything together and then er we'll need to leave it to cool a little bit why do you think we'll need to leave it to cool?</u>
<u n="549" who="S0654">cos if we erm cos if we don't leave it to cool</u>
<u n="550" who="S0655">it</u>
<u n="551" who="S0654">then when <trunc>becau</trunc> then when we cut it open it won't be very good cos the all the</u>
<u n="552" who="S0655" trans="overlap">I know why</u>
<u n="553" who="S0654">cos all the icing would just sink down</u>
<u n="554" who="S0655">erm it's kind of that but the icing would be too runny</u>
<u n="555" who="S0653">yes that is the reason why</u>
<u n="556" who="S0654">mm</u>
<u n="557" who="S0655">it needs to cool down and become a sticky icing not a very very runny one</u>
<u n="558" who="S0653">yes exactly cos it will be super super super runny</u>
<u n="559" who="S0654" trans="overlap">so how many minutes?</u>

<u n="566" who="S0653">erm well</u>
<u n="567" who="S0655"><unclear>please don't tell please don't tell</unclear></u>
<u n="568" who="S0653">a good ten minutes I would've thought</u>

<u n="571" who="S0653">I know</u>

<u n="573" who="S0655">mm</u>
<u n="574" who="S0653" trans="overlap">I could I don't really want to put it in the freezer cos it will get off those</u>

<u n="576" who="S0653">but yes we'll add the chocolate chips when we erm</u>
<u n="577" who="S0655" trans="overlap">so why don't you want to put it in the freezer?</u>
<u n="578" who="S0653">because it will make everything else that touches er it in the freezer defrost that's the only reason why you don't put stuff in freezers normally you know they often do it in baking competitions? but that's because there's nothing else in the freezer erm so if I could clear a bit of space we could do that but I'll try not to get it let it get too hot</u>
<u n="579" who="S0654">yeah cos if it is too hot then er when</u>
<u n="580" who="S0653" trans="overlap">it'll take forever</u>
<u n="581" who="S0655">yeah</u>
<u n="582" who="S0654" trans="overlap">it will just and also if it's too hot it will become more runny and</u>
<u n="583" who="S0653">no no it's not if if it's too hot the chocolate will separate which is disgusting it's not nice at all <unclear/></u>
<u n="584" who="S0655">yeah and then you get like really dark chocolate and really light chocolate</u>
<u n="585" who="S0653">no it's just that it sort of the fat separates out of the chocolate</u>
<u n="586" who="S0655">oh</u>
<u n="587" who="S0653">and it looks all like really gloopy mud</u>
<u n="588" who="S0655">mm</u>
<u n="589" who="S0653">and you can sometimes bring it back <shift new="singing"/> bring it back <shift new="normal"/> you can make it a bit better by adding a little bit of cream but we don't have any cream so I don't wanna take it to that point</u>
<u n="590" who="S0654">mm</u>
<u n="591" who="S0653">so I've taken it off the heat now <pause dur="short"/> cos I'm hoping that there will've been enough <pause dur="short"/> heat for it to <pause dur="short"/> melt the chocolate and <unclear/></u>
