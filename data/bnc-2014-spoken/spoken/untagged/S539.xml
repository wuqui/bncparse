<u n="2" who="S0258">yeah</u>
<u n="3" who="S0257">she might have heard a word</u>
<u n="4" who="S0258">yeah</u>
<u n="5" who="S0257">and she will <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>s</trunc> almost like a child repeat it how the <trunc>wa</trunc>the way she's heard it but it's not necessarily the right word</u>
<u n="6" who="S0258">yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="8" who="S0257">gives us another reason to laugh at her</u>
<u n="9" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="10" who="S0257"><unclear/></u>
<u n="11" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="12" who="S0255">so is it is it Maltese? is that the language?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0255">do you so do you speak Maltese?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0257">no we er er picked up odd words from going there because we'd go there every sort of two or three years as children and you know you learn yes no hello goodbye</u>
<u n="16" who="S0258">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0257">and then some of the erm the food where there isn't a an English translation we would call it the the Maltese term</u>
<u n="19" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0257">erm but so many people were <trunc>w</trunc> you know family and because everybody's your family everybody's related cos the island's so tiny</u>
<u n="21" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="22" who="S0257">and they'd they'd say did your mum not teach you Maltese? and it'd be almost quite sort of shock horror</u>
<u n="23" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="24" who="S0257">and then when my sisters and I were old enough one of them found a course at <anon type="place"/> college a language course in Maltese so we all enrolled</u>
<u n="25" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah oh right</u>
<u n="26" who="S0258">amazing</u>
<u n="27" who="S0257" trans="overlap">but I think there were maybe six people <vocal desc="laugh"/> so the four of us and two other random</u>
<u n="28" who="S0258"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="31" who="S0257">people and there wasn't enough to to warrant running the course</u>
<u n="32" who="S0258">oh that's a shame</u>
<u n="33" who="S0255" trans="overlap">oh that's a shame</u>
<u n="34" who="S0257">but it's a really difficult <trunc>lang</trunc>language because it's it's erm <pause dur="short"/> it's a little bit sort of like it's not like Italian a lot of people think it will be</u>
<u n="35" who="S0255" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="36" who="S0258" trans="overlap">yeah I would've thought so yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0257" trans="overlap">that kind of but it's not it's more sort of Arabic erm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0258" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="39" who="S0257" trans="overlap">Latin influence as well so whilst it's all <pause dur="short"/> they have their own alphabet</u>
<u n="40" who="S0258">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0257">so it's a little bit it's not not as <pause dur="short"/> not as different to English as Greek is there's a lot of</u>
<u n="42" who="S0258" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0257">English formed letters</u>
<u n="44" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0257" trans="overlap">but then there are some like there'll be an H and it's got a cross through one <trunc>o</trunc></u>
<u n="46" who="S0258" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0257" trans="overlap">two crosses through one of the one of the upright bars so it's it it it you can tell it's not the English language</u>
<u n="48" who="S0258" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0257">erm and a lot of the pronunciations of the letters are different as they are in in many other languages as well it's so difficult to read</u>
<u n="50" who="S0258">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0257">but because it is a little country that's having to evolve with the whole of the rest of the world</u>
