<u n="576" who="S0427" trans="overlap">unless you've got high pressure you know</u>
<u n="577" who="S0426" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> you got I got that's right</u>
<u n="578" who="S0427">cos water has to go up that way</u>

<u n="590" who="S0427" trans="overlap">we have to tone it down or it'll kill you <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="591" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/> that's right yeah</u>
<u n="592" who="S0427" trans="overlap">you go in that shower you'll be dead <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="611" who="S0426" trans="overlap">make any more sense?</u>
<u n="612" who="S0427" trans="overlap">there is such a thing as that yes erm that that's where I think it might be something to do with where you turn the <pause dur="short"/> tap on the hot water top the boiler comes on instantly and heats the water</u>
<u n="613" who="S0426">no it's not</u>
<u n="614" who="S0427" trans="overlap">he didn't mean that?</u>
<u n="615" who="S0426">no it didn't mean that</u>
<u n="616" who="S0427" trans="overlap">oh right okay well I give in</u>
<u n="617" who="S0426" trans="overlap">but that could only be a gas thing</u>
<u n="618" who="S0427">erm well I don't know there are new there are taps now apparently that you can have by your sink</u>
<u n="619" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="620" who="S0427">and they do hot water cold water or or boiling water instantly now how they do that</u>
<u n="621" who="S0426">that's just</u>
<u n="622" who="S0427">must be some kind of special <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>electri</trunc> electricity thing they go through I don't know</u>
<u n="623" who="S0426" trans="overlap">okay if it's a Hadron Collider spin off</u>
<u n="624" who="S0427">well I yes it could be yeah</u>
<u n="625" who="S0426" trans="overlap">this is probably how they got the science funding for it</u>
<u n="626" who="S0427">you mean</u>
<u n="627" who="S0426" trans="overlap">it's got it's got</u>
<u n="628" who="S0427" trans="overlap">we make</u>
<u n="629" who="S0426" trans="overlap">impact you see</u>
<u n="630" who="S0427">you mean your kitchen might might be the discovery post Higgs boson</u>
<u n="631" who="S0426">yes</u>
<u n="632" who="S0427">kind of thing?</u>
<u n="633" who="S0426" trans="overlap">exactly <vocal desc="laugh"/> that's right I mean after a while</u>
<u n="634" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="635" who="S0426" trans="overlap">the science foundation in the European Union could fund such a thing</u>
<u n="636" who="S0427">well</u>
<u n="637" who="S0426" trans="overlap">but if it didn't guarantee impact in the real world what's the point of it?</u>
<u n="638" who="S0427">well I I of all the most unlikely places where string theory would be verified</u>
<u n="639" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="640" who="S0427">or negated I never thought of it being you know your kitchen</u>
<u n="641" who="S0426" trans="overlap">but but think how many households often look for string in these times</u>
<u n="642" who="S0427">and they can never find it</u>
<u n="643" who="S0426" trans="overlap">can never find</u>
