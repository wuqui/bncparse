<u n="37" who="S0579">course they don't come out so much cos the trees got too tall and keep the light out <unclear/></u>
<u n="38" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes that's the trouble yes that's right yes I want to get my</u>

<u n="45" who="S0579">yes I must take them out and put them somewhere</u>
<u n="46" who="S0454"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yes I need to get my fence down at the back cos it's too high and it's blocking all the light</u>
<u n="47" who="S0579" trans="overlap">cos your <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>I</trunc>in your <trunc>hou</trunc>? in er?</u>
<u n="48" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="49" who="S0579">is it? oh</u>
<u n="50" who="S0454" trans="overlap">well they're like one point eight metre fences but they didn't</u>
<u n="51" who="S0579">oh <unclear/> fence</u>
<u n="52" who="S0454" trans="overlap">er put them on the ground to begin with they started them off about twenty centimetres above the ground they're over two metres</u>
<u n="53" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="54" who="S0454">it's only a tiny garden so it's blocking all the light</u>
<u n="55" who="S0579" trans="overlap">so it's <unclear>covering down</unclear>?</u>
<u n="56" who="S0454">yes well I'm wondering about sawing a bit off the top because they've got two bars so I could take it down to the top bar and it wouldn't show much that would be about that much it's about six inches isn't it?</u>
<u n="57" who="S0579">oh that's not much no</u>
<u n="58" who="S0454">no well it might not be enough to make a difference</u>
<u n="59" who="S0579">oh oh well</u>
<u n="60" who="S0454">but it's worth a try do you think?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0579" trans="overlap">can you knock them? can you knock them all down if you want to?</u>
<u n="62" who="S0454">I could do I own them all</u>

<u n="66" who="S0454" trans="overlap">bit bad yes might spoil it but</u>
<u n="67" who="S0579" trans="overlap">cos we we found all the trees round here actually <unclear/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes you see trees would too be too big for the space</u>
<u n="69" who="S0579">yeah in yours yeah yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and I think even a hedge would take up too much room but what I needed I should've put in lower fences cos the one at the back and the side they put in</u>
<u n="71" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0454">but I paid for the one in the middle and I shouldn't've done that I should've erm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0454">cos if you wanted the free one it was just wire and rail but that's no good either I mean a wire and rail</u>
<u n="75" who="S0579">no</u>
<u n="76" who="S0454">is nothing but I needed something in between so I should've really paid for my own fencing</u>
<u n="77" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0454">I suppose over time that's what I'll do I'll just have them</u>
<u n="79" who="S0579"><unclear/></u>
<u n="80" who="S0454">replaced and put in one point five metre or</u>
<u n="81" who="S0579">yeah or</u>

<u n="83" who="S0579">yes well we had we had them all going up the back gate at one time and I think I cut those down cos it's</u>

<u n="587" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="588" who="S0454">because of that</u>
<u n="589" who="S0579">and some guy said that to me once</u>
<u n="590" who="S0454">well yes it's true apparently it's getting worse though because of globalisation <vocal desc="misc"/> yes more people speak English but with the rise of countries like Russia and China</u>
<u n="591" who="S0579">mm</u>
<u n="592" who="S0454">and their power they expect people to speak to them in their language</u>
<u n="593" who="S0579" trans="overlap">they want Chinese?</u>
<u n="594" who="S0454" trans="overlap">they expect people to speak to them in their language</u>
<u n="595" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah that's right yeah</u>
<u n="596" who="S0454">and the British can't compete with that whereas other European countries can they'll say fine we'll learn Russian</u>
<u n="597" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="598" who="S0454">fine we'll learn Chinese and they do so Britain's going to get in more and more trouble over this it's interesting</u>

<u n="604" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="605" who="S0579">and their country used to say that try and do in their country</u>

<u n="1043" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0454">they might go home and beat up their wife when they're older so</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I think from I think from a psychological point of view it can do a lot of damage</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0579">damage yeah</u>
<u n="1048" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that they <trunc>c</trunc> they think that's acceptable behaviour and the the message there is the most powerful one can beat up</u>

<u n="1058" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0579">yeah so of course it has changed a lot of course I remember</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0579">in our younger days the ladies you went to a pub the ladies had to stay outside</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0579">even in my day like</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0454">although you still don't see women on their own in pubs which I think's interesting not because it's illegal but they just don't go on their own do they?</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0579" trans="overlap">they don't go no no no</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0454">so we talk about equality and certainly in the law we have equality</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0454">there's nothing to stop me going to a pub on my own nobody does</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0579">no that's it</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0454">when do you ever see a woman on her own in a pub? but you see men go in for a pint all the time after work don't you? on their own</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0454">and they'll stand at the bar and they'll have their pint and then they'll leave</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0579">right</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0454" trans="overlap">even going for a meal <trunc>wo</trunc> you know nothing to do with alcohol women rarely go out for a meal on their own</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0579">I suppose not no</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0454">but it's the done thing for men that's perfectly okay</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0579">that's died away a bit now though I suppose you know ladies who go in together sometimes</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0579">I I <trunc>g</trunc> we're going to the pub sometimes and they have</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes yes you see groups of women don't you?</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0579">I've seen I've seen seven or eight women sitting around the table</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0454">yes but not on their own</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0579">not on their own no</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0454">I think that's quite interesting so we're a long way off socially social equality I think</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0454">we may be there in the eyes of the law</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0454">but social equality isn't there and it's not men stopping women it's <trunc>st</trunc> ingrained I suppose from when you're young because you don't see any women doing it yourself then it doesn't occur to you to go and do it you'd feel you were rocking the boat but I mean how can eating a meal be rocking the boat?</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0579">well I certainly in my day with the ladies yeah they they always stood outside</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0579">they never went inside the pub</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0454">no</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0579" trans="overlap">the men would bring the glass of something out for them like</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0579">yeah cos I suppose now of course you often get more meals in a pub than you used to get</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0454">that's right it's different it's moved away from alcohol like today we were in a pub</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0454">and probably no one was drinking were they?</u>

<u n="1497" who="S0579">since he was eighteen like</u>
<u n="1498" who="S0454">so he couldn't settle there probably either</u>
<u n="1499" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no so he</u>
<u n="1500" who="S0454" trans="overlap">in fact probably worse than the UK because it's not so multinational and he would've been used to a very multi-ethnic workplace</u>
<u n="1501" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah well he was <pause dur="short"/> yeah and of course he's served in other parts he's served parts in he did some work in South America I think somewhere</u>
<u n="1502" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="1503" who="S0579">and also bits in and in Bahrain of course as well</u>
<u n="1504" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes yes and I think that's even harder then to</u>
<u n="1505" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1506" who="S0454">settle when you come home</u>
<u n="1507" who="S0579"><unclear>yes</unclear></u>
<u n="1508" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="1509" who="S0579">and of course he's <trunc>b</trunc> he's of course he's back in Bahrain at the moment isn't he? <unclear>at the <anon type="place"/> bank</unclear></u>
<u n="1510" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that's right I expect he likes it</u>

<u n="1512" who="S0454">yes it's only supposed to be a year but I bet they'll offer to keep him on actually</u>
<u n="1513" who="S0579">I think they asked him to do five years</u>
<u n="1514" who="S0454">oh did they?</u>
<u n="1515" who="S0579" trans="overlap">and he said I'll only do one year and I'll think about it when I er when that's up</u>
<u n="1516" who="S0454">well that's sensible</u>
<u n="1517" who="S0579">so that's what he did then so er</u>
<u n="1518" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1519" who="S0579">I don't I expect he'd want to come back I suppose yeah</u>

<u n="1523" who="S0579">no <unclear/></u>
<u n="1524" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I I think he'll want to stay and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> will say I've had enough of this</u>
<u n="1525" who="S0579">because <unclear>he used to be that way</unclear> and come and visit <unclear>over here</unclear></u>
<u n="1526" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah I think that's more likely it would be</u>
<u n="1527" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1528" who="S0454">cos he's going to enjoy the company</u>
<u n="1529" who="S0579">yes it it's true when he was at home of course he was always the big boss everywhere and gave instructions of course all that went</u>
<u n="1530" who="S0454">exactly I think that's very difficult</u>
<u n="1531" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yeah that would've been difficult for him I suppose</u>
<u n="1532" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and then you're starting again with friendships aren't you?</u>

<u n="1547" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1548" who="S0454">yeah they support their families a lot of them with like one salary might support ten people cos it'll go a lot further of course</u>
<u n="1549" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>the same salary</unclear> yes yeah goes further yes we we we learnt <unclear>from</unclear> this lady who <trunc>s</trunc> always sends her money back to her family</u>

<u n="1553" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>and</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> oh were they?</u>
<u n="1554" who="S0454">because that would be a huge source of income for the government</u>
<u n="1555" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1556" who="S0454">and you'd only target foreigners then because the</u>

<u n="1558" who="S0454">it wouldn't be the locals doing that</u>
<u n="1559" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1560" who="S0454">but it caused an outcry and they had to back down</u>
<u n="1561" who="S0579">back down did they? yeah</u>
<u n="1562" who="S0454">because <trunc>i</trunc> the truth is if those workers went elsewhere then it would cripple the economy</u>
<u n="1563" who="S0579">oh well <unclear/></u>
<u n="1564" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and they're not earning that much so</u>

<u n="1567" who="S0579">yeah</u>
