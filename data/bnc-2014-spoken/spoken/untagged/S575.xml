<u n="367" who="S0019">oy oy oy oy</u>
<u n="368" who="S0018">so I can see how the situation has arisen <pause dur="short"/> I've just gotta check</u>
<u n="369" who="S0017">mm</u>
<u n="370" who="S0018">to see whether that February one was</u>

<u n="384" who="S0017">the fees</u>
<u n="385" who="S0019">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> absolutely</u>
<u n="386" who="S0017">that is mm</u>
<u n="387" who="S0019">but I don't get the fees</u>
<u n="388" who="S0018">no but the thing is if it wasn't the thing about they wanted the bursary back you probably wouldn't question that I had to pay fees for the month that I wasn't there but</u>
<u n="389" who="S0017">mm</u>
<u n="390" who="S0018">that I deferred in <pause dur="short"/> would you? Cos er if you I was still a student until about the eighteenth of January even though I was only there for two days because um the holidays went up to the</u>

<u n="392" who="S0018">I can't remember when</u>
<u n="393" who="S0017">mm</u>
<u n="394" who="S0018">but if it if that situation was in isolation you probably wouldn't question it would you? You'd say</u>
<u n="395" who="S0017">no</u>
<u n="396" who="S0018">oh well yeah you were enrolled in January henceforth you should pay the fees for January</u>
<u n="397" who="S0017">no I would say</u>
<u n="398" who="S0018">it's just in comparison with</u>

<u n="401" who="S0017">continuing or not then they should make no charge for the month</u>
<u n="402" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I agree</u>
<u n="403" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> I think you could argue that</u>
<u n="404" who="S0017">mm</u>
<u n="405" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it'll all be guidelines and what they normally do and</u>

<u n="407" who="S0019">mm</u>
