<u n="1" who="S0509">yeah so er I did some photography modelling for my friend <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and he was doing darkroom photography so</u>
<u n="2" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="3" who="S0509">he was taking it on film so he's no idea how any of them have turned out</u>
<u n="4" who="S0510">oh okay</u>
<u n="5" who="S0509">is it yeah</u>
<u n="6" who="S0510">so was he doing it black and white or colour?</u>
<u n="7" who="S0509">yeah black and white</u>
<u n="8" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="9" who="S0509">so it was I I didn't can you do colour in darkroom?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0510">of course you can yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0509">oh I didn't know that but yeah I think it must be easier to do</u>
<u n="12" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="13" who="S0509">black and white</u>
<u n="14" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="15" who="S0509">he's never actually done darkroom stuff before so he's like well hopefully I won't mess it up <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know</u>
<u n="16" who="S0510"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="17" who="S0509">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0510" trans="overlap">oh yeah it's quite a process wasn't there when you were that was quite appealing for you? darkroom photography?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0509">I mean it er seems quite cool to me but</u>
<u n="20" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0509">we had at college at college at school we had erm this light sensitive er like I want to say paper but it's not paper it's like flimsy plasticy stuff</u>
<u n="22" who="S0510">okay yeah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0509">and so you could like create stuff that looked kind of dark roomy</u>
<u n="24" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="25" who="S0509">by like putting all these objects on it and then</u>
<u n="26" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0509">you'd just expose it to light and then you could like wash that and it makes them develop it and then it would just be like the silhouettes of these things</u>
<u n="28" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0509">and by layering different things you could create different like depth of light and shade on it</u>
<u n="30" who="S0510">yeah oh I don't</u>
<u n="31" who="S0509" trans="overlap">which was quite cool</u>
<u n="32" who="S0510" trans="overlap">remember seeing any of those</u>
<u n="33" who="S0509">well no because I couldn't do it like as a proper project</u>
<u n="34" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="35" who="S0509">because we didn't actually have the the liquid stuff to develop it in</u>
<u n="36" who="S0510" trans="overlap">the chemicals right</u>
<u n="37" who="S0509">to to like</u>
<u n="38" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="39" who="S0509">so it would it would all just change colour completely</u>
<u n="40" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="41" who="S0509">I used it in my book as like backing stuff though which was lot a lot of people</u>
<u n="42" who="S0510" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="43" who="S0509" trans="overlap">used it for</u>
<u n="44" who="S0510">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0509" trans="overlap">it was that was the only thing really</u>
<u n="46" who="S0510">so how many were were you of were were there of you as it were</u>
<u n="47" who="S0509">er</u>
<u n="48" who="S0510" trans="overlap">doing the modelling?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0509">there oh I don't know cos they weren't all there when I was there but er</u>
<u n="50" who="S0510" trans="overlap">was he just doing portrait photography?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0509">yeah he was doing erm he wanted to do like his project's on fear</u>
<u n="52" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="53" who="S0509">so he was <trunc>a</trunc> he like would ask er us he asked us the other day like what our fears were and then he would do something relating to that</u>
<u n="54" who="S0510">oh okay</u>
<u n="55" who="S0509" trans="overlap">so like one girl <vocal desc="laugh"/> er <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who I met in a NCS but she goes to my college and she's friends with them so I see her sometimes</u>
<u n="56" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0509">but erm her fear was clowns so they got <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to get made up and and dressed as a clown and stand behind her and <trunc>sh</trunc></u>
<u n="58" who="S0510" trans="overlap">but you did tell her beforehand</u>
<u n="59" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>

<u n="73" who="S0509">er I just like oh there's plenty but I just went with failure</u>
<u n="74" who="S0510"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="75" who="S0509">so erm so it was quite funny actually but er because I turned up and he he'd wanted to do erm like <pause dur="short"/> er a projection behind me with like a cardboard cutout to do like er an F or whatever you know</u>
<u n="76" who="S0510">oh okay</u>
<u n="77" who="S0509">cos that's not really the kind of failure I was thinking of but whatever anyway that was what he was gonna do cos it was easier for him but he found out with someone else can't really project cos the lighting just doesn't work</u>
<u n="78" who="S0510">oh okay</u>
<u n="79" who="S0509" trans="overlap">in this scenario so erm I'd just got my <vocal desc="laugh"/> test paper back from psychology</u>
