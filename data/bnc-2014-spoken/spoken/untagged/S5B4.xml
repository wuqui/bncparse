<u n="304" who="S0024">okay</u>
<u n="305" who="S0144">and basically <vocal desc="laugh"/> he said how Bernays <trunc>aft</trunc> it was only after he had done the meeting with him that he realised what a genius he was</u>
<u n="306" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="307" who="S0144">because he basically had manipulated the whole meeting from even before he got there till things happening after the meeting he manipulated the whole thing just to him a lesson <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="308" who="S0024">what? how?</u>
<u n="309" who="S0144" trans="overlap">like he er <pause dur="short"/> like for example he said oh oh he was saying to him how how to become a er well the <trunc>tech</trunc>techniques of PR <event desc="sound of baby"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is she okay? she's getting a bit frantic</u>

<u n="312" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah?</u>
<u n="313" who="S0144">just as an example of his power you know cos he was showing his power basically</u>
<u n="314" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="315" who="S0144">and they said oh yeah we've we thought it was a good idea this year to a er a big forum on consumer images you know we've got such and such involved and it's exactly what Bernays used in just his like flippant kind of example in the interview <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="316" who="S0024">really?</u>
<u n="317" who="S0144">yeah so he must have just picked up the phone after the interview and set the balls in motion</u>
<u n="318" who="S0024">really?</u>
<u n="319" who="S0144">it was just erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it it's just started off saying a few examples like you know the the incubator one in in <unclear/> you know that don't you?</u>
<u n="320" who="S0024">no what one?</u>
<u n="321" who="S0144">erm well you remember all these stories that come out before wars you know been trying to get justification in in their action into a war</u>
<u n="322" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="323" who="S0144">like they did with Syria recently with the chemical weapons</u>
<u n="324" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="325" who="S0144">same thing in Iraq they did a massive thing saying they got this fifteen-year-old girl to say that the erm Saddam Hussein's kind of private army had been going round hospitals and taking babies out of incubators</u>
<u n="326" who="S0024">oh</u>
<u n="327" who="S0144">leaving them on the cold concrete floors to to die</u>
<u n="328" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="329" who="S0144">you know and this testimony came from a fifteen-year-old girl who got up in front of a it was like a UN panel and you know and stated it erm which after the war was found out that this fifteen-year-old girl was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="330" who="S0024">oh</u>

<u n="334" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="335" who="S0144">cos it's just about shaping people's minds into justifying movement into a certain direction it's just so powerful</u>
<u n="336" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="337" who="S0144">like another one when remember that erm that in the last Gulf War <pause dur="short"/> when they pulled down Saddam Hussein's statue?</u>
<u n="338" who="S0024">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0144">that was a</u>
<u n="340" who="S0024">that was <unclear/></u>
<u n="341" who="S0144" trans="overlap">that was an image</u>
<u n="342" who="S0024" trans="overlap">major</u>
<u n="343" who="S0144">that needed to happen because it was a shifting point you know it was winning hearts and minds basically</u>
<u n="344" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="345" who="S0144">it was like yeah America has or whoever erm has got control we're the is the symbol of winning the war</u>
<u n="346" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0144">of take or remove the statue and it had people in the streets like cheering and</u>
<u n="348" who="S0024">mm yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="349" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I mean like I read no I read erm <pause dur="short"/> an article one of the journalists that was there who was so disgusted by that he's he's basically become an independent journalist now</u>
<u n="350" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="351" who="S0144">he said that all of the journalists were kind of shepherded into these hotels around that square and basically it was rent a mob you know who came in it was nothing it wasn't you know they were paid people to come in</u>
<u n="352" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah yeah that was the one yeah</u>
<u n="353" who="S0144">and pull down the statue it was all staged</u>
<u n="354" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="355" who="S0144">but the way it was shown on the media for days</u>
<u n="356" who="S0024">oh it was on every day for</u>
<u n="357" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="358" who="S0024">weeks</u>
<u n="359" who="S0144">and that was it was like yes we've won and for the opening <unclear/> that must have been shown in Iraq as well not just for us but for the Iraqi people seeing that</u>
<u n="360" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="361" who="S0144">they must have seen that as a a step as well that okay Saddam Hussein's lost <pause dur="short"/> and it's just the things like that it's just so powerful</u>
<u n="362" who="S0024">oh yeah that's what the book is all about</u>
<u n="363" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="364" who="S0024">not just images though?</u>
<u n="365" who="S0144">no no talking about the history at the moment it's gonna go back to the first world was now I think talk about that because I mean the British were masters of propaganda in the First World War</u>
<u n="366" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="367" who="S0144">erm and then you had people like Edward Bernays and <unclear/> Lippman come to prominence like in the twenties they started writing about it how how to control people's minds you know to control society and oh been sick</u>
<u n="368" who="S0024">can you pass me a tissue?</u>
<u n="369" who="S0144">erm and then the Second World War Joseph Goebbels kind of took their ideas</u>
<u n="370" who="S0024" trans="overlap">who?</u>
<u n="371" who="S0144">the Nazi propaganda minister</u>
<u n="372" who="S0024">who?</u>
<u n="373" who="S0144">Joseph Goebbels</u>
<u n="374" who="S0024">Goebbels</u>
<u n="375" who="S0144">erm and he took like British ideas as well from the First World War <unclear/> a lot of good posters and things didn't they took all those ideas and basically made the <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="376" who="S0024">oh no no no no no</u>
<u n="377" who="S0144">the most successful propaganda campaign in history really</u>
<u n="378" who="S0024" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="nonsense"/></u>
<u n="379" who="S0144">erm and then it's kind of moved on to er kind of consumer based mind control</u>
<u n="380" who="S0024">mm yeah</u>
<u n="381" who="S0144">er which was what Bernays was writing about cos he was the nephew of Freud</u>
<u n="382" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah but it's just yeah it's quite crazy how it must have all</u>
<u n="383" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah it was all about the <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> it was all about unconscious desires you know and tapping into that</u>
<u n="384" who="S0024">but still <unclear/> now</u>
<u n="385" who="S0144">yeah oh yeah it's still</u>
<u n="386" who="S0024" trans="overlap">but now you've got the internet and the TV where you can just go boom there it is</u>
<u n="387" who="S0144">yeah yeah well it's changing though because people are becoming slightly more savvy about it you know they can see through it</u>
<u n="388" who="S0024" trans="overlap">well yeah</u>
<u n="389" who="S0144">so they're constantly having to make it more sophisticated and even more hidden you know erm like remember that erm on GMTV or whatever it is called now remember I got so angry with that guy the doctor who was questioning immunisations with babies</u>
<u n="390" who="S0024">oh yeah</u>
<u n="391" who="S0144">and the way that he was took to pieces erm by that other guest they had on and they they did that repeatedly over two weeks on different channels and newspapers and</u>
<u n="392" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="393" who="S0144">it it was a systemated er systematic PR campaign basically I would have loved to have investigated that cos I'm sure that was funded by people like Glaxosmithkline</u>
<u n="394" who="S0024" trans="overlap">do you <unclear>think</unclear>?</u>
<u n="395" who="S0144">and Bayer yeah</u>
<u n="396" who="S0024">well if you see it on loads of channels it's a bit suspect isn't it?</u>
<u n="397" who="S0144">well look it's the arguments they set up cos they weren't</u>
<u n="398" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah false arguments and</u>
<u n="399" who="S0144" trans="overlap">false arguments it</u>
<u n="400" who="S0024">change direction quite easily</u>
<u n="401" who="S0144">yeah I mean the argument they used very kind of emotive things like <pause dur="short"/> oh you're you're neglecting your child if you're not giving them immunisations</u>
<u n="402" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="403" who="S0144">that was basically the main kind of <unclear/> of the argument</u>
<u n="404" who="S0024" trans="overlap">and you want yeah and that erm what's the other argument? that you say that <trunc>ev</trunc> you know you know if nobody else has everybody else is inoculated yours doesn't need it</u>
<u n="405" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="406" who="S0024">and things like that</u>
<u n="407" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="408" who="S0024">and it's just wrong because for the whole community</u>
<u n="409" who="S0144">yeah</u>

<u n="411" who="S0144">yeah</u>
