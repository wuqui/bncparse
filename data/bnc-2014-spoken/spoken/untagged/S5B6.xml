<u n="1" who="S0232">we were on one side of the shop because we went out of the shop on the way down for the train station and dad was pushing a pushchair and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was talking to him and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had no reins on and she was running I'm like I don't trust them I don't trust them I went over the road I put <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> in she's standing on her pushchair don't let her out <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="3" who="S0232">cos if anyone's going to let her run on the road it'll be you two</u>
<u n="4" who="S0198">it's <trunc>go</trunc> you don't it's not often you see children with reins anymore is it?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0232">no well she's not got reins round she's got like a little backpack that little orange one she puts her toys in it it's got a string on the back so you just hold her so she can't run off</u>
<u n="6" who="S0198" trans="overlap">where she <unclear/> yeah I don't see the harm in reins I don't see the harm in them</u>
<u n="7" who="S0232">if it stops them running into the road and getting run over or</u>
<u n="8" who="S0198" trans="overlap">exactly I mean that's the whole point it means they can still toddle but you don't have to hold their hand the entire time or stand stand on top of them the entire time</u>
<u n="9" who="S0232" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0198">and you can keep them at arm's length</u>
<u n="11" who="S0232">yeah I mean especially like if it's just like if it's just like me <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I've got the pushchair with me I've got one hand on the pushchair one hand keeping you know one eye keeping an eye on <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I don't need you know if I got <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> there at least I know she's not going to run off well she will if anyone's going to run off it'll be <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="12" who="S0198" trans="overlap">it'll be <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="13" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0198"><vocal desc="cough"/> you know I mean children run off all the time they'd never use anything like that in <anon type="place"/> they always let their children run run riot there it's really surprising yeah <trunc>always</trunc> I'm always like oh my god you see them running down the road on their own I don't know how more of them aren't knocked over</u>
<u n="15" who="S0232" trans="overlap">oh really?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0198">I really don't <unclear/> fairly relaxed still</u>
<u n="17" who="S0230">now you imagine them to be a really strict culture don't you?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0232" trans="overlap">yeah I was going to say that</u>
<u n="19" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah no when it comes to <trunc>the</trunc>they're really strict about like they're not strict they're all about making their well feeling like their children have to study as much as possible but it's always quantity over quality for one and then I think because they give them such a hard time about other things that when it comes to <trunc>dis</trunc> other <trunc>di</trunc> kinds of discipline or family time at the weekend like at a restaurant they do</u>
<u n="20" who="S0232" trans="overlap">they're a bit more lax</u>
<u n="21" who="S0198">they don't discipline them at all you go to a restaurant sometime they'll be running around screaming and doing whatever and yeah health and safety-wise they're not very strict with things like that you're often climbing over they'll have playgrounds and <trunc>scho</trunc> erm play climbing frames in schools and stuff like and that just let five-year-olds run around <trunc>u</trunc><trunc>u</trunc>unsupervised on their own</u>
<u n="22" who="S0232" trans="overlap"><unclear>no</unclear> way</u>
<u n="23" who="S0198">I don't think if a child gets hurt in school typically it's not still not typical for the parents to blame the school they're just like well children hurt themselves it just happens</u>
<u n="24" who="S0232" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0198">so like some things they're more <trunc>reasona</trunc> like more reasonable <unclear>about</unclear> other things not just depends really but yeah children often still walk to school by themselves a lot because their culture's safer</u>
<u n="26" who="S0232">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0198">so you'll see really little ones though taking themselves to school sometimes and you're like ah bless them</u>
<u n="28" who="S0232" trans="overlap">really see I mean in in this country I mean I'm already worried about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> going to senior school on her own</u>
<u n="29" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0232">and that's four ways away it's four years away yet and I'm already I'm already worried about her walking on her own because because</u>
<u n="31" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah four years away yeah for <unclear/> away <pause dur="short"/> and that's when she'll be eleven or eleven won't it? yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0232" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0198">whereas yeah no by that point woah they're doing <trunc>eve</trunc> I mean they're taking themselves to school they're taking themselves to afterschool classes they're taking themselves to their academies in the evening</u>
<u n="34" who="S0232" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0198">by eleven they're allowed to walk around pretty freely it's all all kinds of times in the evening</u>
<u n="36" who="S0232">oh right</u>
<u n="37" who="S0198">erm yeah they're not so strict about that <pause dur="short"/> it's more customs and they do overwork their children horribly though once they get to middle school age once they get to about <trunc>thirte</trunc>thirteen to eighteen is a terrible time for a <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="38" who="S0232" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="39" who="S0198">really horrible they're just made to study until the early hours every morning they have a saying though in the last year of high school if you sleep for four hours you're <unclear>okay</unclear> sleep for five and the you won't get to university you want to go to so <trunc>sixte</trunc> eh sixteen to eighteen-year-olds aren't <trunc>ge</trunc> aren't sleeping no more than four hours a night</u>
<u n="40" who="S0232">blimey</u>
<u n="41" who="S0198">and it's like they make them go to these academies and send them to these lessons and stuff but there's no way they're still learning you're not you can't you know I've only got to sit down and read a textbook for an hour and I start to get tired and I stop taking information in so it's completely pointless</u>
<u n="42" who="S0232" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0198">like it's not making them any more intelligent or anything it's just very competitive so <pause dur="short"/> it's a shame</u>
<u n="44" who="S0232">see that's the one of the when they had SATs at the end of this year because I never knew they did SATs at the end of year two</u>
<u n="45" who="S0198">no it does have have they always done that?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0232">I don't know cos <trunc>wha</trunc> I'm I mean the problem with her school is I think they assume that everyone knows how the school system works so course with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> first one I don't know how the school system works and I said to her teacher shouldn't we have been told they were having these SATs tests?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0198" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0232">and she's like well we do make a point not to make a big deal out of it because some parents will go and do stupid things like getting tutors and putting lots of pressure on them and at seven six and seven they don't need that and I'm like no that's fine but as a parent would it hurt for you to stick on the bottom of a newsletter children have got up-and-coming SATs tests at the end of year two you know?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0198" trans="overlap">it's not necessary <pause dur="short"/> sATs tests yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0232"><trunc>s</trunc> or on the term dates just put SATs tests year two <trunc>yo</trunc> that's all you've got to do no big deal out of it's got to be made</u>
<u n="51" who="S0198" trans="overlap">definitely</u>
<u n="52" who="S0232">I mean I get <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> sometimes says that I push <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> a bit hard and I'm not pushing her hard but it's like over the holidays we've been doing out times tables and some maths as she's been writing in her homework diary cos there's no point in not doing anything for six weeks because by the time she goes back to school she'd have she'd have forgotten lots of stuff</u>
<u n="53" who="S0198" trans="overlap">exactly exactly I think that's a big problem in our culture is that we're <trunc>act</trunc> we we don't actually make our children study much at home at all</u>
<u n="54" who="S0232">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0198">at all like there's one thing like you know being crazy about it but</u>
<u n="56" who="S0232" trans="overlap">I mean she reads every day without fail she has to read every day without fail</u>
<u n="57" who="S0198" trans="overlap">I think if you want your child to to to you know perform really well then you <trunc>ne</trunc> you need to do it</u>
<u n="58" who="S0232" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0198">cos otherwise they'll they're just you know</u>
<u n="60" who="S0232">well that's like my <trunc>ar</trunc> my argument with erm with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I mean I know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s got his disability and I know he's autistic and yeah he is never going to be as I I mean <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s already outshining <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> with like capabilities at school and stuff</u>
<u n="61" who="S0198" trans="overlap">won't actually be able to <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> well yeah he must be I mean <unclear/> I'm sure</u>
<u n="62" who="S0232" trans="overlap">do you know what I mean? but but on the other hand I always think well if <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is behind she'd wouldn't hurt if she pushed him a bit harder because then he won't be as far behind everyone else do you think he'd be a bit more determined?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0198" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="64" who="S0232">it's like he still can't use a pencil because he's got really bad like muscle tone he'd <unclear/> felt-tip pens is alright because obviously you don't have to push too hard but if you give them a pencil he can't even push hard enough to and I'm not saying that's his fault cos obviously that's not him being lazy he just physically can't do it but on his his school's solution was well give him a laptop</u>
<u n="65" who="S0198" trans="overlap">mm yeah well</u>
<u n="66" who="S0232">well he's never going to learn to write then is he? if you give him if you take away any</u>
<u n="67" who="S0198" trans="overlap">I don't understand the laptop solution to problems now</u>
<u n="68" who="S0232">exactly</u>
<u n="69" who="S0198">dyslexic have a laptop well</u>
<u n="70" who="S0232" trans="overlap">and I and I understand yeah they've got to learn to be able to use computers and that because so much is technology is involved now in just normal everyday life but</u>
<u n="71" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah I mean <pause dur="short"/> assist with learning</u>
<u n="72" who="S0232"><trunc>yo</trunc> how is he ever going to learn to write if you don't make him write in the first place?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0198">and it's like it's</u>
<u n="74" who="S0232">and also what's the harm of him writing with a felt-tip pen if he has to?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0198" trans="overlap">has to</u>
<u n="76" who="S0232">okay it's probably more of a pain in the bum if he makes mistakes and that but</u>
<u n="77" who="S0198">it still gives him also it's regardless of what he can do in the future as a as a teenager or whatever <trunc>h</trunc>he well how is he going to feel like when he can't he knows everyone else can write and he can't?</u>
<u n="78" who="S0232">exactly</u>
<u n="79" who="S0198">it's a confidence thing it doesn't matter if he gets a job or not it's just personal confidence</u>
<u n="80" who="S0232" trans="overlap">I mean he'll go to he's I mean it'll be senior school senior school he'll start next year</u>
<u n="81" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0232">and the <trunc>sch</trunc> cos he's at a special needs school now</u>
<u n="83" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah they're going to mainstream them aren't they?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0232">they've said now they're going to mainstream him and I think it'll do him the world of good because I think he'll be more he'll want to do more of what the more able children are <unclear/></u>
<u n="85" who="S0198" trans="overlap">do yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0232">he'll still have his one-on-one like specialist and he'll come out of he'll come out of</u>
<u n="87" who="S0198" trans="overlap">specialist yeah because they have a special needs departments</u>
<u n="88" who="S0232">yeah he'll come out of his like regular class and go off to smaller groups you know one-on-one sessions and stuff like that but I do think I'm hoping that because he'll be seeing kids that are more capable he'll want to emulate them and hopefully it might make him a bit more</u>
<u n="89" who="S0198">it'll make him more aware of what <unclear/> people are doing</u>
<u n="90" who="S0232" trans="overlap">exactly</u>
<u n="91" who="S0230" trans="overlap">and surely by encouraging him to use a pen he's going to build up <unclear/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0232" trans="overlap">his muscle tone will get better anyway exactly</u>
<u n="93" who="S0198" trans="overlap">well yeah of course yeah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0232">but just give him a laptop doing that and not only that but it makes me laugh they're always going on about how we can't hold a pen very well but he can play an Xbox and a PlayStation fine</u>
<u n="95" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0232">well hang on a minute those pads can be pretty weighty after a while if he can do that and</u>
<u n="97" who="S0198">of course they <unclear/></u>
<u n="98" who="S0232" trans="overlap">and he can play DSs and everything else like that so his I think with <trunc>de</trunc> his his he's just not pushed enough sometimes I don't think there's</u>
<u n="99" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0232">and also I think because he's more one of the abled children at his special needs school</u>
<u n="101" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah exactly he's probably top of his special needs school at the moment</u>
<u n="102" who="S0232" trans="overlap">yeah I mean you've got some kids there that like are in permanent wheelchairs can't you know even sit up on their own without being supported you know?</u>
<u n="103" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0232">so I think because of that as well I think the school leave him to just get on with his to <trunc>pl</trunc> <trunc>leav</trunc>leave him to his own devices half the time <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> says at school all he does is play</u>
<u n="105" who="S0198">yeah well</u>
<u n="106" who="S0232">but then but then she should do <trunc>som</trunc> say something to the school as well</u>
<u n="107" who="S0198">as well</u>
<u n="108" who="S0232">take him out of the school then if you're not happy with it I mean change schools mention it go to you know well he's got a social worker for crying out loud take it up with them if you have to</u>
<u n="109" who="S0198">oh yeah and as you said he she could be doing numerous things</u>
<u n="110" who="S0232" trans="overlap">she could do stuff at home with him it's just bone idleness isn't it though?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0198" trans="overlap">this is another thing people leave their entire care of their child and the education of the child down to the education system</u>
<u n="112" who="S0232" trans="overlap">to the school and then they blame the school when they don't do very well or something yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0198">it's not you know you're the parent you're <trunc>s</trunc> you're you're just you're more responsible if anything</u>
<u n="114" who="S0232">I mean like I said I'm lucky that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> quite enjoys doing stuff like that anyway</u>
<u n="115" who="S0198">yeah yeah yeah you <trunc>hav</trunc> you don't actually have to force her to do it yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0232" trans="overlap">I mean it's not like I have to I'd have to force her to do it I mean some day she'll be like do I have to? like yesterday she didn't write her diary because by the time we got home and had our dinner it was late but then she'll but I'll make her write two days today</u>
<u n="117" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah she was tired yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="119" who="S0232">because I'm horrible <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="120" who="S0198">no that's not I think that's a reasonable thing to do I've <trunc>co</trunc> I've come across friends that have done that have been fairly successful from having just a little light touch of discipline when it comes to academic stuff <unclear/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0232" trans="overlap">yeah I mean one of the I mean at the end of every holiday well I always make a point of saying to her teacher what can we work on over the holidays? and what especially these longer holidays <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="122" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah it's <unclear/> six weeks of nothing I mean <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="123" who="S0232">especially with her arm being like it is we'd be doing even less anyway so we're not going out on the to the parks as much we're not going out on her bike</u>
<u n="124" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0232">because she's just learned to ride her bike as well</u>
<u n="126" who="S0198">ah I know ah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0232" trans="overlap">I couldn't believe that I was so worried about her falling off that bike <trunc>beca</trunc> she'd outgrew her helmet she'd have got too small for it</u>
<u n="128" who="S0198">oh right</u>
<u n="129" who="S0232">and so I rushed out getting her a new helmet thinking she's going to fall off that bike and smash her head <unclear>needn't</unclear> have worried had I? she can't bloody ride the thing <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="130" who="S0198">ah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0232">but yeah but I don't but I always make a point of saying to her teacher what can we work on? and her head I mean her teacher said well you know she's really good at times tables but we want them to be quicker want them to be able to fire them off really fast you know?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0198" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0232">so just keep just keep practising those do her homework because she's the teacher is always saying how good her writing is she said she loves that she's so <trunc>descript</trunc> I mean she's got some poetry at home that she wrote</u>
<u n="134" who="S0198">wow</u>
<u n="135" who="S0232">and I'm <trunc>impr</trunc> I mean I could've <unclear/> it I could've wrote she she come home one she come home one day do you remember I told you about? she come home we were playing schools and erm she's like write a poem using similes and blah blah blah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0198"><vocal desc="gasp"/></u>
<u n="137" who="S0232">and I was like</u>
<u n="138" who="S0198"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="139" who="S0232">I was like okay</u>
<u n="140" who="S0198">you don't hardly know what a simile is until you're in secondary school</u>
