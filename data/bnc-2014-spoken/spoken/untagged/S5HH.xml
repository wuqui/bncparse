<u n="5" who="S0063">and I was just wondering you got you've got a Yorkshire accent?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0147">I have</u>
<u n="7" who="S0063">I was just wondered and you're from <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0147">I am</u>
<u n="9" who="S0063">I was just wondering <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> where in Yorkshire is <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0147">it's in South</u>
<u n="11" who="S0063">Cos</u>
<u n="12" who="S0147">Yorkshire</u>
<u n="13" who="S0063">oh right <unclear/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0147">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's in South Yorkshire <pause dur="short"/> I think they have actually changed the boundaries em over the last few years but it's still but it is actually classed as South Yorkshire</u>
<u n="15" who="S0063" trans="overlap">gotcha <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0147">but I think em that where I used to live em was quite a broad accent but em neighbouring areas such as <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="17" who="S0063">mm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0147">I think if you compare their accents with <anon type="place"/> you can really see the difference</u>
<u n="19" who="S0063">they'd be different? Yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0147">Cos they're very very much more broad</u>
<u n="21" who="S0063">yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0147">and I think a bit more difficult to understand <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0063">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/> Michael Parkinson came from <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="24" who="S0147">he did?</u>

<u n="26" who="S0147">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0063">it's a massive place it's just got em</u>
<u n="28" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0063">it's it's all over the east of the Pennines</u>
<u n="30" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0063">almost going up towards <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="32" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0063">but the accent changes again to a different kind of one</u>
<u n="34" who="S0147">it does  It does  yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0063">yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0147">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I think my accent's changed a lot because I've lived in em <anon type="place"/> for now thirty-eight years</u>
<u n="37" who="S0063">yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0147">thirty-eight years and I <pause dur="short"/> but when I listen to myself back on a recording</u>
<u n="39" who="S0063">yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0147">I think sometimes that I sound quite Yorkshire and there's certain things that I know I definitely say that are very Yorkshire-isms but</u>
<u n="41" who="S0063">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0147">you might you know that better than me</u>

<u n="44" who="S0147">you might do you pick that up?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0063">yeah a little bit yeah <pause dur="short"/> you you you took you it's definitely the same accent as Sean Bean the actor but it's not as strong</u>
<u n="46" who="S0147">is it now?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0063">so it's as if it's become more mild</u>
<u n="48" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0063">and it's moving towards  moving towards  a neutral kind of accent</u>
<u n="50" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0063">but it's not not there</u>
<u n="52" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0063">you know kind of thing</u>

<u n="122" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="123" who="S0063">and then at about the age of eleven or twelve I suddenly got my Burton accent and then the funny thing was when I was fourteen I moved away from Burton</u>
<u n="124" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0063">so I had this upper Midlands accent probably</u>
<u n="126" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0063">for about three years</u>
<u n="128" who="S0147">yeah</u>

<u n="138" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0063">which I never got down south cos when I was fourteen we moved down to Essex</u>
<u n="140" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0063">the accent down there is very different <pause dur="short"/> it's quite em it's quite nasal an Essex <pause dur="short"/> and Essex is basically after the second world war</u>
<u n="142" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0063">Essex was very agricultural after the Second World War em maybe starting just before it there was lots of overspill from London <pause dur="short"/> when the Londoners were bombed out and eh instead of like rebuilding slums in the east end they built out and out and out into South Essex</u>
<u n="144" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0063">so Essex is really kind of well when I was there in the nineteen eighties it's like one generation away from being Cockney's <trunc>n</trunc> nearly all of them</u>
<u n="146" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0063">you know <pause dur="short"/> obviously you have to go right in the sticks to get a Cockney accent</u>

<u n="149" who="S0063">which is more like Kent</u>
<u n="150" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0063">and it's like it's a bit like ooh ar ooh ar kind of thing</u>

<u n="487" who="S0147">and then I was fine afterwards but it wasn't until</u>
<u n="488" who="S0063">that's the thing</u>

<u n="490" who="S0063">you weren't injured at the time</u>
<u n="491" who="S0147">it was yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's the impact <pause dur="short"/> I think it was the impact <pause dur="short"/> cos I did a hundred</u>
<u n="492" who="S0063">yeah</u>
<u n="493" who="S0147">just up down up you know just up and down two steps a hundred times</u>
<u n="494" who="S0063">mm</u>
<u n="495" who="S0147">em and it and I I felt alright afterwards and I got a bit out of breath and everything <pause dur="short"/> I though ooh I've done done a good bit of exercise there <pause dur="short"/> but what I failed to think was</u>
<u n="496" who="S0063">mm</u>
<u n="497" who="S0147">I did not <trunc>p</trunc> put my trainers on cos they were downstairs <pause dur="short"/> it was when my daughter said afterwards <pause dur="short"/> you know <trunc>d</trunc> what did you have on your feet mum? And I said eh actually I didn't have anything <pause dur="short"/> she said that's it <pause dur="short"/> that's what's done it <pause dur="short"/> you've it's the impact of the <trunc>po</trunc></u>
<u n="498" who="S0063">doesn't look very good</u>
<u n="499" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="500" who="S0063">I had a funny thing on my feet</u>
<u n="501" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="502" who="S0063">which similarly started out as painless</u>
<u n="503" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="504" who="S0063">but stayed painless and what I had I might still have I had a big blue circle where my ankle was</u>
<u n="505" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="506" who="S0063">and I thought how did I do that? Well it's a blue circle <pause dur="short"/> so there's there's</u>
<u n="507" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="508" who="S0063">blood there and what happened to my ankle was at some point a tiny little vein ruptured</u>
<u n="509" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="510" who="S0063">and it never <trunc>re</trunc> repaired itself</u>
<u n="511" who="S0147">right</u>
<u n="512" who="S0063">and the blood kept going</u>
<u n="513" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="514" who="S0063">and then slowly came back but it was completely painless but it just looked very very weird you know</u>
<u n="515" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="516" who="S0063">if it had been too much bigger I would have had a blue foot and I could have taken it out at parties and and scared people with my blue foot</u>
<u n="517" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="518" who="S0063">but I didn't of course cos I'm sensible <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="519" who="S0147">well I think every day when I get up it's gonna go down or something <pause dur="short"/> but I don't I think probably the warm weather's contributing a bit to making it more swollen as well em somehow</u>
<u n="520" who="S0063">oh yeah</u>
<u n="521" who="S0147">but em</u>
<u n="522" who="S0063">can you put witch hazel on it or something? You know witch hazel? <trunc>Y</trunc> you used to you know if I bumped my head when I was a kid</u>
<u n="523" who="S0147">I put no</u>
<u n="524" who="S0063">out the witch hazel would come out and the bump would go down</u>
<u n="525" who="S0147">I put ice on it  I put ice on it</u>
<u n="526" who="S0063">mm</u>
<u n="527" who="S0147">but the only thing I had in my freezer was a pack of Aunty Bessie's roast potatoes <pause dur="short"/> I put those on it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="528" who="S0063">that's nice <pause dur="short"/> that's another use</u>
<u n="529" who="S0147">yeah I just kept it on for half an hour</u>
<u n="530" who="S0063">it's another use of potatoes isn't it?</u>
<u n="531" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="532" who="S0063">you know</u>
<u n="533" who="S0147">but that was it really so yeah</u>
<u n="534" who="S0063">no that's good</u>
<u n="535" who="S0147">yeah</u>
<u n="536" who="S0063">you can articulate it a bit which is good</u>
<u n="537" who="S0147">mm</u>
<u n="538" who="S0063">I think you've got to look at the positives haven't you? You know</u>
<u n="539" who="S0147">so I don't know</u>
<u n="540" who="S0063">it's not like you <trunc>y</trunc> you it's not in a plaster cast is it?</u>
<u n="541" who="S0147">no not <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="542" who="S0063">it's just</u>
<u n="543" who="S0147">and that's why I keep thinking I've been walking around on something that's you know</u>
<u n="544" who="S0063">mm</u>
<u n="545" who="S0147">fractured or something like that and I should have had it</u>
<u n="546" who="S0063">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="547" who="S0147">wrapped up <pause dur="short"/> that's what I'm thinking I <trunc>sh</trunc> maybe should have had it wrapped up in you know my something to give it a bit more support really</u>
<u n="548" who="S0063">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing it's impossible to know whether it's it's benefiting your ankle walking around or whether it's making it worse?</u>
<u n="549" who="S0147">yeah <pause dur="short"/> isn't it?</u>
<u n="550" who="S0063">hooray</u>
