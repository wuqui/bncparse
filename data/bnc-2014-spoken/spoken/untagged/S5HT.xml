<u n="2" who="S0619">hi hi</u>
<u n="3" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah what have you lost?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0619" trans="overlap"><unclear/> my phone it's just somewhere</u>
<u n="5" who="S0618">oh okay very good okay yeah so no I'm hungry now</u>
<u n="6" who="S0619" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="7" who="S0618">yeah I know I am sitting down I'm sitting I'm sitting thank you</u>
<u n="8" who="S0619" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="9" who="S0618">yeah ah the old knee is still a bit dodgy and I'm just hoping once I'm a farmer that it becomes erm like not a problem</u>
<u n="10" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="11" who="S0618">but no I from what I can gather I need to build up that muscle there on my quadricep cos that one's overdeveloped and that one's underdeveloped</u>
<u n="12" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0618">so when I walk for an hour or more it pulls my kneecap out of alignment so it's all grating and then it hurts but anyway and I had a torn cartilage when I was thirteen</u>
<u n="14" who="S0619">nice</u>
<u n="15" who="S0618" trans="overlap">it was misdiagnosed for three years because I was so young interesting factoid</u>
<u n="16" who="S0619">yeah I've got well I used to have cartilage problems but as my <trunc>kne</trunc> as my legs I can make them stronger</u>
<u n="17" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0619">it seems to be sorting themselves out</u>
<u n="19" who="S0618">good</u>
<u n="20" who="S0619">a little bit but yeah really common in athletes footballers especially have loads of problems with cartilage in their knees</u>
<u n="21" who="S0618">mm how interesting yeah Arsenal</u>
<u n="22" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="23" who="S0618">really interesting fact that I'm sure you're bound to retain</u>
<u n="24" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yes really</u>
<u n="25" who="S0618">erm used to have the worst injury record in the Premiership now they have the best erm what's made the difference is was it last season? I think it was last season they took on the German World Cup-winning physio</u>
<u n="26" who="S0619">oh</u>
<u n="27" who="S0618">guy who erm tailors these workout programs for each individual athlete and so you get different types of exercise which obviously aren't suited to everybody because everybody is different</u>
<u n="28" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0618">erm and so Arsenal are having fewer injuries and the injuries that they do have recovery is much much faster</u>
<u n="30" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0618">erm which I think is magnificent</u>
<u n="32" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0618">so it goes to show if you've got the experts that know what they're all about they can sort it out</u>
<u n="34" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah yes and I've had loads of personal trainers in my time erm some for not very long at all or some for quite a while or when I used to go to this gym regularly at home I was like the I don't know what the word is test dummy for new personal trainers</u>
<u n="35" who="S0618">oh cool</u>
<u n="36" who="S0619">erm so like the head trainer would come to me and go I've got a new person who's just qualified</u>
<u n="37" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0619">will you do a few sessions with them for free?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0618">wow <unclear/></u>
<u n="40" who="S0619">erm and then you can say what's good what's bad what needs to change</u>
<u n="41" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0619">whether you like them or not as a person if they're professional if they know what they're talking about</u>
<u n="43" who="S0618">it's good</u>
<u n="44" who="S0619">erm so that was really good but only one person and that was the head trainer really sort of stood watched analysed said</u>
<u n="45" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="46" who="S0619">you've got weak wrists you've got weak ankles blah blah blah blah blah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0619">work on this we can work on this do this do this erm and the rest just do you know generic things</u>
<u n="49" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0619">to get you fit but they don't take into account that every person is different</u>
<u n="51" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0619">erm</u>

<u n="130" who="S0619" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="131" who="S0618">you are just going to be an expert skier when you can actually see where you're going see the icy spots see the bumps in the snow</u>

<u n="138" who="S0618" trans="overlap">that's so cool</u>
<u n="139" who="S0619">and I know a lot of these things that kind of <pause dur="short"/> I don't know whether they're necessarily erm not <trunc>s</trunc> superficial's not artificial or you know things to do with appearance it's like beneath appearance but appearance-based things</u>
<u n="140" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0619">and not like I don't know</u>
<u n="142" who="S0618">I think appearance-based things my personal take on it is where things are the last to manifest so anything that's been going on psychologically spiritually emotionally once you start sorting it on the physical like for example going to the gym or for example not doing your nasal thing that's because the change has already taken place on the inner</u>
<u n="143" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah yeah that's</u>
<u n="144" who="S0618">so this is like the outer representation of what's already occurred on the inner</u>
<u n="145" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0618">which is you know another great thing for you as well to think like with your nasal thing you've really kicked this</u>
<u n="147" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0618">because it was last to manifest in the physical</u>
<u n="149" who="S0619">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="150" who="S0618">woohoo</u>
<u n="151" who="S0619">yeah and it's</u>
<u n="152" who="S0618">lots to celebrate it's really good <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="153" who="S0619" trans="overlap">skin skin'll be next</u>
<u n="154" who="S0618">mm mm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0619">but I've made to you know I'm making the effort internally which is drinking water <trunc>s</trunc> er when I was in England changed medication again</u>
<u n="156" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0619">erm so hopefully it should sort itself out</u>
<u n="158" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0619">and I think you know not just</u>
<u n="160" who="S0618" trans="overlap">and the biggest thing being happy</u>
<u n="161" who="S0619">yeah and yeah and not seeing sort of only positive thinking is gonna change this</u>
<u n="162" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0619">or you know? going it's going to change it's going to change but it's all part of the same</u>
<u n="164" who="S0618">yeah and it has changed</u>
<u n="165" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0618">so it's not it's no longer at a point in the future it's now at a point in the present <pause dur="short"/> woohoo</u>
<u n="167" who="S0619">woohoo <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="168" who="S0618" trans="overlap">I kind of feel like I need to have a big party for you it's like yay <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> yay <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <vocal desc="misc"/> yeah put up some balloons and some banners and</u>
<u n="169" who="S0619" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah I mean there's still you know work to do but it'll get there it'll all get there</u>
<u n="170" who="S0618">yeah there's always work to do though I think that that's the point of life the universe and everything it's all a work in progress</u>
<u n="171" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know I'm I'm never going to sit down and go right I am done <vocal desc="laugh"/> I am never going to get any better</u>
<u n="172" who="S0618" trans="overlap">no it's never going to happen and I think that's the key to it is to when you wake up to there is no destination</u>
<u n="173" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="174" who="S0618">it's all about now</u>
<u n="175" who="S0619">yes</u>

<u n="178" who="S0618">mm</u>

<u n="180" who="S0618" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="181" who="S0619">and like time's ticking</u>
<u n="182" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="183" who="S0619">so you know it's not</u>
<u n="184" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="185" who="S0619">it's it I'm not doing it because of that but subconsciously somewhere in there are these decisions being made because we made this promise</u>
<u n="186" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="187" who="S0619">that we would do these things</u>
<u n="188" who="S0618">when are you twenty-five?</u>

<u n="200" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm when's your school holiday?</u>
<u n="201" who="S0619">er I can't remember that I need to check</u>

<u n="221" who="S0619">I don't know everything it's all tied in to what we were saying about you know pay the money do it fast or pay the money do it comfortably er and with flying from Krakow <unclear/></u>
<u n="222" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <unclear/><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="223" who="S0619">yeah erm you know pay I don't know anyway</u>

<u n="230" who="S0618">that is so funny</u>
<u n="231" who="S0619">I don't know why I'm so into time it's sort of social conditioning I think</u>
<u n="232" who="S0618">yeah very possibly I I got broken off that living in Northern Ireland and in England and when I was part of the rat race I used to have breakfast meetings at like seven o' clock or whatever ridiculous time of the morning it was yeah</u>
<u n="233" who="S0619" trans="overlap">oh yeah you said this before in Ireland it doesn't work like that</u>
<u n="234" who="S0618">no not at all you have a meeting at ten and if you were there like an English person arriving at ten to ten because you don't want to be late and then at ten o' clock you're still the only person there at ten past ten you're still the only person there and by half past ten everybody's arrived</u>
<u n="235" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="236" who="S0618">and you're having coffee and tea and scones cos you have to have scones and it was almost an unspoken rule that while you're drinking tea and eating scones before a meeting you don't talk about the meeting</u>
<u n="237" who="S0619">yeah only everything else</u>
<u n="238" who="S0618" trans="overlap">you talk about yeah everything about family or friendships or what you did at the weekend</u>
<u n="239" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="240" who="S0618">and then the meeting will start about eleven so for a ten o' clock meeting don't expect to do anything before eleven but it's quite nice in a way it's a more relaxed lifestyle and if you think oh shit there's a bit of traffic I'm going to be five minutes late you don't need to bother ringing anybody</u>
<u n="241" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="242" who="S0618">you don't need to drive like a dick to try and get there all the sooner</u>
<u n="243" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="244" who="S0618">it doesn't matter</u>
<u n="245" who="S0619">we were talking about that this morning er with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> about er in Spain and life in Spain and you know? everything is so slow and <foreign lang="spa">siestas</foreign> in the afternoon</u>
<u n="246" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm that's so sensible</u>
<u n="247" who="S0619">and people sort of cancelling last minute cos they just they go oh whatever</u>
<u n="248" who="S0618"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="249" who="S0619">ah and I just thought that'd be awful <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="250" who="S0618">I think it's going to be kill or cure for you</u>
<u n="251" who="S0619">I'd hate it I'd absolutely hate it but I think it's probably good for me</u>
<u n="252" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="253" who="S0619">erm</u>
<u n="254" who="S0618">I used to be quite obsessed with time until I lived in Northern Ireland</u>
<u n="255" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0618">and I still drove like an arsehole when I got there and can remember overtaking everything it was possible to overtake on <trunc>bi</trunc> bendy country roads on my hour's journey to work every day and then after I probably took about two or three years and I completely chilled out erm even now I don't drive fast and it's fine and I'm not looking at the clock</u>
<u n="257" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="258" who="S0618">and it was definitely from Northern Ireland I think had I lived and worked in Belfast or gone down south and lived and worked in Dublin it might have been different</u>
<u n="259" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="260" who="S0618">but living rurally working relatively rurally er all change</u>
<u n="261" who="S0619">I don't know how I'm going to cope because I do <pause dur="short"/> yeah I never really considered myself to be a sort of control freak person or someone who likes everything to be just so but I think I'm sort of learning that I am <vocal desc="laugh"/> that person</u>
<u n="262" who="S0618" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="263" who="S0619">erm especially with time er and especially with you know getting things done and being quite not controlling but I like being in control and knowing what's happening</u>
<u n="264" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="265" who="S0619">knowing you know the plan or the situation</u>
<u n="266" who="S0618">yeah</u>

<u n="269" who="S0619">I need the sun</u>
<u n="270" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
