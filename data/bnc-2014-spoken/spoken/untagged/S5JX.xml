<u n="770" who="S0619"><unclear>no</unclear> it's interesting <pause dur="short"/> it's an interesting one anyway but I think yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was <pause dur="short"/> what was I watching or listening to? and it was about <pause dur="short"/> how men and women view things <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="771" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="772" who="S0619">this just sort of lack of I don't know manners and you know I just don't think a woman or a girl would ever do that</u>

<u n="774" who="S0619">erm <pause dur="short"/> don't know</u>
<u n="775" who="S0618">no it's interesting it is interesting <pause dur="short"/> I wonder if a lot of it is sort of upbringing <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="776" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="777" who="S0618"><vocal desc="sigh"/> you know <vocal desc="sigh"/> I suppose <unclear>being</unclear> my generation was the last generation where the woman stayed at home and cooked and cleaned washed and ironed and basically made life as easy as possible for her breadwinner husband</u>
<u n="778" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="779" who="S0618">mind you saying that you know my mum did go out to work as well she did both cos she was a superhuman <pause dur="short"/> so I guess my parents' generation was the kinda transition generation</u>
<u n="780" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="781" who="S0618" trans="overlap">I was born <pause dur="short"/> what? early seventies</u>

<u n="784" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="785" who="S0618">so <pause dur="short"/> yeah they were probably the last generation of that <pause dur="short"/> my generation certainly both partners go out to work <pause dur="short"/> equally <pause dur="short"/> although still domestic chores and <pause dur="short"/> child raising <pause dur="short"/> I suppose it's predominantly still perceived as a <pause dur="short"/> female role <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> I do think <pause dur="short"/> even my mum even though she went out to work she still did all of the chores <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="786" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="787" who="S0618">she <pause dur="short"/> I I suppose I learned from that that the female role was to make things or make life easy as possible for the male <pause dur="short"/> because they had the important bread winning winning role <pause dur="short"/> so to carry out <pause dur="short"/> yeah no I guess there's a lot of that so I guess that's now being challenged and coming undone <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> I do wonder with your woman as well though it comes across as pretty aggressive <pause dur="short"/> walking in a particular line and not getting out of the way</u>
<u n="788" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="789" who="S0618">which</u>
<u n="790" who="S0619">yeah it is saying you know I'm looking for a fight I suppose</u>

<u n="794" who="S0619" trans="overlap">it's expected that we're gonna move out of the way</u>

<u n="796" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="797" who="S0618">from the other way I've not taken the armrest to see if a man will take it and found that they do <pause dur="short"/> quite quickly</u>
<u n="798" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="799" who="S0618">and <pause dur="short"/> I've found that when I'm sat next to a woman it takes them a long time but they do eventually take the arm rest</u>
<u n="800" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="801" who="S0618">so I've done it form the viewpoint of I'm not taking the armrest <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
