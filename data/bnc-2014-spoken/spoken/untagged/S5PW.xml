<u n="7" who="S0012">that's right</u>
<u n="8" who="S0008">so you don't get so much height but you get more width</u>
<u n="9" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0008">and I worked out that a twenty-four was about the same height as the one we had so you didn't get the</u>

<u n="16" who="S0012">trouble is</u>
<u n="17" who="S0008">there's something a little bit over powering you know</u>
<u n="18" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0008">because our room isn't very big</u>

<u n="41" who="S0013">mm</u>

<u n="100" who="S0008">we had a rubber tree in our flat and er slowly all the leaves dropped off <pause dur="short"/> and it was just a pot about that big which people used to use as an ash tray <pause dur="short"/> with the single pole sticking up <pause dur="short"/> we just left it there <pause dur="short"/> and then after about eighteen months someone noticed that was shooting again <pause dur="short"/> started watering it again it started growing again</u>
<u n="101" who="S0012">what?</u>

<u n="108" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0012">weird <pause dur="short"/> that must have gone dormant for that long then</u>

<u n="111" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> plants do <pause dur="short"/> plants are weird things aren't they? I mean we we through throughout the winter we brought this little plant up <pause dur="short"/> that that was dead</u>
<u n="112" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0012">by all purposes that was dead <pause dur="short"/> then there was a shoot <pause dur="short"/> and that come up and that grew <pause dur="short"/> and we we wrapped it around this big wire wire thing and it come out beautiful</u>
<u n="114" who="S0008">mm mm</u>
<u n="115" who="S0012">come the summer dead again</u>
<u n="116" who="S0008">oh right so it does that then</u>
<u n="117" who="S0012">well it's supposed to be in flower in August</u>
<u n="118" who="S0008">oh right <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean er I got this er our Abutilon which <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got a seed from from Durham</u>
<u n="119" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0008">and they come out in little red flowers</u>
<u n="121" who="S0012">I like them</u>
<u n="122" who="S0008">and er this particular one has been frozen off twice</u>
<u n="123" who="S0012">yeah?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0008">and it still had this little bit of green left so I thought well one leaf <pause dur="short"/> so I brought it indoors this winter and um it's sort of come to life again <pause dur="short"/> and I'll give it some Growmore <pause dur="short"/> I though I'll let it grow a few leaves cos it's just like a twig with a leaf on the top</u>
<u n="125" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0008">but I re-potted it in a big pot</u>
<u n="127" who="S0012">oh I see yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0008">you know and give it some roots cos I tend to leave flowers leave these things in too smaller pots</u>
<u n="129" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0008">you know cos they don't do very well then if you</u>
<u n="131" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="132" who="S0008">you know they're so susceptible to drying out</u>
<u n="133" who="S0012">they are aren't they yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0008">you know unless you're very careful watering them</u>
<u n="135" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="136" who="S0008">whereas with a big pot you know you can put quite a bit in damp in there for them</u>
<u n="137" who="S0012">that that plant we reckon that is not very good is dying off</u>
<u n="138" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0012">that one that we never watered</u>
<u n="140" who="S0013">um yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0012">when you think about we were talking about when you think about where they're living <pause dur="short"/> they're living in the jungle in trees</u>
<u n="142" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0012">not in bright sunlight</u>
<u n="144" who="S0013">no no we thought about moving it didn't we</u>
<u n="145" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0013">we moved that one</u>
<u n="147" who="S0012">we moved that one and hopefully that'll survive</u>
<u n="148" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0012">but I think that that one in particular don't like it at all</u>
<u n="150" who="S0013">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's the same Orchid isn't it? Yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0012">same <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="153" who="S0012">well we did have some  we did have some  hot weather didn't we?</u>
<u n="154" who="S0013">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes we did</u>
<u n="155" who="S0008">well that's right it was <pause dur="short"/> cos my green house was blimmin scorching</u>
<u n="156" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0013">yeah</u>

<u n="163" who="S0013" trans="overlap">we'll have to move them all over I'll probably put them all over there</u>
<u n="164" who="S0012">learned last night why the potato crop wasn't very good last year</u>
<u n="165" who="S0008">Cos of the late frost</u>
<u n="166" who="S0012">not only because of the late frost <pause dur="short"/> because of the cold nights in May and June</u>
<u n="167" who="S0008">oh right</u>

<u n="1667" who="S0008">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and then they left it a year <pause dur="short"/> then they well no they stopped <trunc>vi</trunc> making them in ninety-eight</u>

<u n="1669" who="S0013">yeah they</u>
<u n="1670" who="S0008">and then they left it a couple of years and then they started making them again</u>

<u n="1676" who="S0024">uh-huh</u>
<u n="1677" who="S0008">but they the reason they started making them again is because they use exactly the same</u>

<u n="1679" who="S0008">what is it chassis? And everything</u>
<u n="1680" who="S0012">yeah</u>

<u n="1690" who="S0013">oh right</u>
<u n="1691" who="S0008">but the trouble is you can't get a a handbook which is <trunc>f</trunc> got everything in it <pause dur="short"/> because all the handbooks are for the early models and they sort of improved quite a bit of the stuff inside of them</u>
<u n="1692" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1693" who="S0008">like the air-conditioning and stuff like this</u>

<u n="1707" who="S0012">well I suppose you can search on the net for some answers can't you?</u>

<u n="1712" who="S0013">oh I see</u>

<u n="1720" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="1721" who="S0008">well it's good in one <pause dur="short"/> well it is good you know but you know one of the ways they you know make them so economical is that the you know you can't race em around</u>
