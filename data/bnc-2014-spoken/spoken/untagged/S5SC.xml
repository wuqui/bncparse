<u n="2" who="S0604" trans="overlap"><trunc>ou</trunc> well er had an outbreak</u>
<u n="3" who="S0603">what and what about can you pick up scars if cities have the</u>
<event desc="begin overlap"/>
<u n="4" who="S0493" trans="overlap">recording okay alright love?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<event desc="end overlap"/>
<u n="6" who="S0603">if you start a city with a faded figure? in a city with a faded figure</u>
<u n="7" who="S0604">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0603">so if say if he's in anywhere in the Middle East</u>
<u n="9" who="S0604">or it's not <trunc>ju</trunc> sorry it's not just a scare it's any sort of outbreak of a blue you know you're just in a city with an outbreak</u>
<u n="10" who="S0603">er so yeah so you can</u>
<u n="11" who="S0604" trans="overlap">it's not just a zombie</u>
<u n="12" who="S0603">but you can you can avoid the erm the cities that look like they're gonna outbreak just don't go near them but if he's in the Middle East and say I he's in Karachi there's no faded figures on there but then suddenly someone draws Karachi</u>
<u n="13" who="S0604">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0603">then he's gotta get out of Karachi before his next go</u>
<u n="15" who="S0604">yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0603">so that might be handy to have the dispatcher to look after Ollie to get him out of cities</u>
<u n="17" who="S0493">but like if he obviously <vocal desc="sigh"/> obviously we don't want him to die for future games either do we?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0603">mm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0493">but like it's not like he's out <trunc>ou</trunc> he'd be out of the game I'll have a civilian which can help a bit <pause dur="short"/> but if there's if we've got four and and we've got three good ones and we wanted the backup that's fine if</u>
<u n="20" who="S0603" trans="overlap">so either well it's either have the dispatcher who can move him but I think <unclear/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0493" trans="overlap">but then so we're worrying a lot about one</u>
<u n="22" who="S0604">mm yeah and I think Jackie's more useful</u>
<u n="23" who="S0603">uhu so <trunc>sh</trunc> do you wanna take</u>
<u n="24" who="S0604" trans="overlap">well er that's like a like an an attacking game with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and you're going for the defence</u>
<u n="25" who="S0493" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="26" who="S0604">if you <unclear/></u>
<u n="27" who="S0493" trans="overlap">not just that</u>
<u n="28" who="S0604" trans="overlap"><unclear/> play aren't we?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0493">I think I think Jackie's pretty good as relationships go and her ability's pretty good and we've got the backup of doing that and there's no we can <trunc>elim</trunc> eradicate cos <pause dur="short"/> you've gotta be a bit luck to eradicate something really haven't you? you've gotta cure it and be there</u>
<u n="30" who="S0603" trans="overlap">and <unclear/></u>
<u n="31" who="S0493" trans="overlap">and there not to be</u>
<u n="32" who="S0603" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0493" trans="overlap">many cubes close together so that's a good backup and it's good to have Jackie for that</u>
<u n="34" who="S0603">but <pause dur="short"/> if he goes he goes</u>
<u n="35" who="S0493">yeah the he died like a hero</u>
<u n="36" who="S0604">and has a two-year-old</u>
<u n="37" who="S0605">so why is he going then tell me?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0493">well he's got</u>
<u n="39" who="S0603" trans="overlap">he can't take any more scars and so if he gets another one</u>
<u n="40" who="S0604" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0603">he's gone erm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0493">but hang on a second do not gain a scar when you're in a city when it outbreaks</u>
<u n="43" who="S0603">but that doesn't account for scars which are counted when you're a faded figure because then it</u>
<u n="44" who="S0493">so just avoid I wouldn't I wouldn't be in black anyway apart from to put one one research one</u>
<u n="45" who="S0603" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="46" who="S0493" trans="overlap">medical</u>
<u n="47" who="S0603">so just don't go anywhere near the black</u>
<u n="48" who="S0604">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0603">yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0493">and I wanna avoid Asia anyway because I get one less turn if I start my turn in Asia</u>
<u n="51" who="S0603">right so you're gonna be limited <unclear/></u>
<u n="52" who="S0493" trans="overlap">so I can completely stay out of black anyway because Europe has already got so it's not colours Europe's already got a military base so that's fine I can go anywhere in Africa to put one down and I can go in the red part of Asia which fine I'll lose a go by staying here but I'm I don't have to even touch black</u>
<u n="53" who="S0603">uhu uhu okay yeah so so we don't need the new assignment role</u>
<u n="54" who="S0604">so we're going for one quiet night</u>
<u n="55" who="S0603">yeah</u>
<u n="56" who="S0604">erm and we've got four to choose did you want the research station the military station?</u>
<u n="57" who="S0605" trans="overlap">I thought you wanted the research one</u>
<u n="58" who="S0604">well I think that it means both it I think you get to choose whether it's a military</u>
<u n="59" who="S0493" trans="overlap">but this is a military base yeah so I would say</u>
<u n="60" who="S0604" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="61" who="S0493">when it says research station</u>
<u n="62" who="S0604" trans="overlap">okay</u>

<u n="67" who="S0603" trans="overlap">that's less than five there</u>
<u n="68" who="S0603">take the last six cards of the deck for</u>
<u n="69" who="S0493" trans="overlap">forecast cards? yeah that's</u>
<u n="70" who="S0603" trans="overlap">yeah forecast is really good erm this quarantine marker on any two cities could be helpful</u>
<u n="71" who="S0493">yeah cos for Jackie's B plan B</u>
<u n="72" who="S0603">so</u>
<u n="73" who="S0604">forecasts er initiative one quiet night</u>
<u n="74" who="S0493" trans="overlap">one quiet night</u>
<u n="75" who="S0604">forecast and what one did you want?</u>
<u n="76" who="S0493">two extra actions are pretty good two <trunc>remo</trunc> two disease cubes removed</u>
<u n="77" who="S0603">that that could be useful if but like only if you're trying to like outbreaks</u>
<u n="78" who="S0493" trans="overlap">that could be good for <trunc>eradicatio</trunc> for eradicating</u>
<u n="79" who="S0603">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0604">okay</u>
<u n="81" who="S0603">it's not er we haven't got the medical erm the</u>
<u n="82" who="S0605"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="83" who="S0603">there's quite a handy one where once you've cured a disease you can</u>
<u n="84" who="S0605"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="85" who="S0603">you can right you can take five cubes that are from a connecting city</u>

<u n="88" who="S0604">right</u>
<u n="89" who="S0603">so I think we've got a <trunc>m</trunc> I think when you do take these it's an action it's gotta be classed as an action</u>
<u n="90" who="S0604" trans="overlap">I don't</u>
<u n="91" who="S0493">I would guess so it's on the action</u>
<u n="92" who="S0603">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0493" trans="overlap">but then you'd want it</u>
<u n="94" who="S0604" trans="overlap">I would</u>
<u n="95" who="S0603" trans="overlap">cos otherwise they wouldn't</u>
<u n="96" who="S0493" trans="overlap">even if it wasn't</u>
<u n="97" who="S0603">stick it on the action</u>
<u n="98" who="S0605" trans="overlap">but you</u>
<u n="99" who="S0493" trans="overlap">but even if it wasn't an action that you took if they wanted to remind <trunc>y</trunc>you that it's an option you can take they would want you to have it in front of you on a card right?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0604">but as you say <trunc>i</trunc>it says <trunc>ac</trunc> you know spend and action spend and action doesn't say that</u>
<u n="101" who="S0603">but it it's an action to equip <pause dur="short"/> it's like equip that's an action</u>
