<u n="525" who="S0024">make sure that they're all on the website</u>
<u n="526" who="S0013">you know what that is don't you <pause dur="short"/> it's just a bit of black card behind it</u>

<u n="533" who="S0024">yeah but that's what they're doing er even down the road <pause dur="short"/> and I think it's cos they've seen your <trunc>phot</trunc> I dunno</u>
<u n="534" who="S0012">probably <pause dur="short"/> that could be <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="535" who="S0013" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="536" who="S0024">they <trunc>be</trunc> putting all the  all the  food dishes behind the black card and taking it</u>
<u n="537" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="538" who="S0013">I see right</u>

<u n="547" who="S0012">yeah all yeah yeah</u>
<u n="548" who="S0024">yeah</u>
