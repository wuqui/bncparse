<u n="100" who="S0196">erm so</u>

<u n="114" who="S0196">okay</u>
<u n="115" who="S0192">they make erm <pause dur="short"/> I mean if you I did a lot of research into that cancer one at the time because you know people were like we donated so much money and then you actually look at their spending about thirty percent of that about like a hundred two hundred million a year goes back into their company back into advertising back into doing this kinda stuff it's a lot of money that they take and</u>

<u n="123" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0196">getting awareness out there which costs money</u>
<u n="125" who="S0192">but they're massive industries I mean like</u>

<u n="127" who="S0192"><trunc>ch</trunc><trunc>ch</trunc>charities for cancer earn like hundreds and hundreds of millions every year <pause dur="short"/> and it's not actually in their interest to actually find a cure for cancer cos then they'll stop getting all that money</u>
<u n="128" who="S0196">yeah I know</u>
<u n="129" who="S0192">so</u>
<u n="130" who="S0196">hang on one second</u>

<u n="142" who="S0196">right I need a cup of tea <pause dur="short"/> what were you saying about the charity <trunc>ca</trunc> the charity?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0192" trans="overlap">tell her not to worry yes <pause dur="short"/> ah I'm just sceptical I've watched numerous documentaries about you know these massive companies who've actually put a lot of money into stopping the cures and to you know hiding cures and just they want care that takes a long time rather than a cure <pause dur="short"/> I mean they're making hundreds of millions of pounds a year why would they wanna find a cure then they'd stop making that kind of money so</u>
<u n="144" who="S0196">yeah of course they would</u>
<u n="145" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I'm just sceptical about charities</u>
<u n="146" who="S0196" trans="overlap">but I I mean yeah but you <trunc>al</trunc>you always look into things</u>
<u n="147" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0196">and</u>
<u n="149" who="S0192">I did quite <trunc>resear</trunc> lot of research into it</u>
<u n="150" who="S0196" trans="overlap">er educate and <pause dur="short"/> yeah and that and I think that's great you should be educated on what you're putting your money towards</u>
<u n="151" who="S0192">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="152" who="S0196">erm <pause dur="short"/> but at the same time I think sometimes because there are these <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> let me just er I don't know how heavy this <trunc>m</trunc> is meant to be <unclear>do you know</unclear>?</u>
<u n="153" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I I don't make tea or coffee or</u>
<u n="154" who="S0196" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="155" who="S0192">no idea</u>
<u n="156" who="S0196">erm <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="157" who="S0192">I'll turn it on I know how to do that</u>
<u n="158" who="S0196">you do?</u>
<u n="159" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="S0196">wicked</u>
<u n="161" who="S0192">not that it's the wrong button <pause dur="short"/> woah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0196">woah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0192">that nearly blew my head off</u>
<u n="164" who="S0196">but I think sometimes there's these you know there's these charities whereby you know they're not legit and they're not doing what they</u>
<u n="165" who="S0192"><unclear>definitely</unclear></u>
<u n="166" who="S0196" trans="overlap">er said they do and then it makes all the the dodgy charities</u>
<u n="167" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0196">I think the ones best known of course is going to be there's going to be more money in promotion and advertising</u>
<u n="169" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0196">but at the same time because they are so big you're more likely that your money's actually going into the correct place</u>
<u n="171" who="S0192">yeah I mean to a certain degree but if you think what er</u>
<u n="172" who="S0196" trans="overlap">yeah to a <trunc>cer</trunc> of course to a certain degree because not all charities have the luxury of cancer</u>
<u n="173" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but <trunc>l</trunc>let's talk about Breast Cancer Research</u>
<u n="174" who="S0196">yeah</u>
<u n="175" who="S0192">yeah <pause dur="short"/> as an example let's say <pause dur="short"/> they earn a lot more than this but let's say they earn a hundred million a year <pause dur="short"/> and thirty million of that goes back into their own company <pause dur="short"/> for advertising <pause dur="short"/> why does a company like Breast Cancer Research need to advertise? we all know about it <pause dur="short"/> it's all very very popular</u>
<u n="176" who="S0196" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no that's <trunc>absolute</trunc> no when I was saying that I thought the same <trunc>t</trunc> yes er</u>
<u n="177" who="S0192" trans="overlap">they don't need to spend thirty million pounds on <trunc>adver</trunc> that's a lot of money it's one third</u>
<u n="178" who="S0196">but then we're not in that business we don't know do we?</u>
<u n="179" who="S0192" trans="overlap">if I give a quid I'm giving them thirty-three pence of it just so they can do what they want basically</u>
<u n="180" who="S0196" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> but I guess <trunc>bec</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> I mean my only my only reasoning behind that would be because they are such a big company and they do have so much advertising that</u>
<u n="181" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="182" who="S0196">the money then does need to go back to keep that advertising going</u>
<u n="183" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0196">but at the same time I get what you're saying because does that advertising campaigns need to carry on to that level?</u>

<u n="499" who="S0192">mm</u>

<u n="517" who="S0192">erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I both love to experience erm and therefore having a child would be one of the biggest experiences we could possibly have so obviously that's a massive draw <pause dur="short"/> erm however there's some negatives <pause dur="short"/> we probably wouldn't be ready to have children until late thirties I wouldn't think <pause dur="short"/> we wouldn't be qualified enough</u>
<u n="518" who="S0196">that's alright</u>
<u n="519" who="S0192">educated enough settled down enough to have children <pause dur="short"/> but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s mum hit the menopause at forty-one and her mum's sister at like forty or something so they hit it</u>

<u n="1236" who="S0196">yeah</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0192">do all that kind of stuff <pause dur="short"/> option number two which is what I wanted to do more which was pop home for a month or two <pause dur="short"/> go to South Africa and do another teaching qualification that lasts like two or three months <pause dur="short"/> and then travel Africa for a year <pause dur="short"/> but once <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had told her parents that she might be coming home she couldn't tell them that we weren't coming home so we kinda had to sit with that one <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>f</trunc> I would rather <trunc>n</trunc> have come home for a little bit and then travelled cos at the minute with our jobs I can either do a Master's or I can er do a Delta <pause dur="short"/> there's two different qualifications the Master's takes a year and is obviously a Master's</u>

<u n="1247" who="S0192">okay <pause dur="short"/> eventually I definitely will need an MA <pause dur="short"/> to teach at universities you need a Master's at least</u>

<u n="1263" who="S0192">but the Master's is better overall <pause dur="short"/> it's something we'll need definitely <pause dur="short"/> we'll need a Master's we can't keep progressing but for the next two or three years we could live without one we could still get a better job with a Delta <pause dur="short"/> so I guess I wanted to postpone the MA <pause dur="short"/> do it a little bit later and to travel <pause dur="short"/> like I have itchy feet pretty badly and I was getting a bit stressed coming home thinking like really stressed out trying to get this apartment and stuff all this bullshit that they made us go through to rent a fucking apartment</u>

<u n="3699" who="S0194">mm</u>
<u n="3700" who="S0192">shouldn't give them juice the the problem is okay you've got all the cheap juices which I'm sure you know they're just no good it's basically sugar water</u>

<u n="3703" who="S0194">still not?</u>
<u n="3704" who="S0192">the problem is that the high fructose content of an orange is negated by the fact that it's got high fibre high nutrient blah blah blah blah blah so when you eat one orange yes it's quite high in sugar but you're <trunc>n</trunc> you're only eating one orange and you're getting fibre and nutrients</u>
<u n="3705" who="S0194">mm</u>
<u n="3706" who="S0192">problem is when you have a glass of orange juice about yea big that's five oranges <pause dur="short"/> so you you'd never just eat five oranges in a row</u>

<u n="3708" who="S0192">so it's the juice of five oranges so you're getting all of the sugar from five oranges</u>
<u n="3709" who="S0194">yeah</u>
<u n="3710" who="S0192">but you're not getting the fibre from the five oranges and some of the nutrients your body can't process them because it's so high in sugar <pause dur="short"/> so everything I was reading it was like if you have juice have like that much so you're like having one apple's worth or something</u>
<u n="3711" who="S0194">yeah</u>
<u n="3712" who="S0192">you shouldn't because when you have a glass like that it's like I mean I've made orange juice you need like five big oranges to like get</u>
<u n="3713" who="S0194" trans="overlap">oh god it's mega it's mega</u>
<u n="3714" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah like apples so I haven't drunk fruit juice in a long time either</u>
