<u n="116" who="S0428">do you need some help? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0472">we basically never get round to booking a holiday and just end up deciding what we're gonna do for the holiday like the day before we go on holiday <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="118" who="S0434">which is why you end up camping in the rain</u>
<u n="119" who="S0472">yeah erm so</u>
<u n="120" who="S0434" trans="overlap">so this is like if you actually organise a <unclear/> <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="121" who="S0472" trans="overlap">well no actually what we would prefer to do is go camping in the UK</u>
<u n="122" who="S0428">not in the rain</u>
<u n="123" who="S0472" trans="overlap">erm <pause dur="short"/> not in the rain but it looks like the weather's gonna be bad so</u>
<u n="124" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0472">we've been looking at cheap flights and we can get cheap flights to <anon type="place"/> if it's bad weather</u>
<u n="126" who="S0428">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0472">and we'll just do that if if the forecast is looking bad like on the first day of our holiday we'll just go to <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="128" who="S0434">wow</u>
<u n="129" who="S0428" trans="overlap">what what's the erm where are you thinking camping wise?</u>
<u n="130" who="S0472">Wales</u>

<u n="135" who="S0434">Wales or <anon type="place"/> hm</u>
<u n="136" who="S0472">but you can't really like we like to go rock climbing</u>
<u n="137" who="S0428">ah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0472">and so doing that in the UK is a lot easier cos we've got guidebooks and we've got like we've got we can bring out stuff</u>
<u n="139" who="S0434" trans="overlap">uhu uhu</u>
<u n="140" who="S0472">like you don't have to bring ropes and stuff on the plane</u>
<u n="141" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0472">so we tend to stay in the UK if it's good weather so we can do that</u>
<u n="143" who="S0434">fair enough</u>
<u n="144" who="S0428">there's loads of rock climbing around <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="145" who="S0434" trans="overlap"><anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="154" who="S0428"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="155" who="S0434">let the recording show that she's swearing at me</u>
<u n="156" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="288" who="S0472" trans="overlap">mm I like that</u>
<u n="289" who="S0428">and you you have a scenario then you pick a number between one and ten you kind of give a you're given like a personality or something</u>
<u n="290" who="S0472" trans="overlap">mm we did that at writing club</u>
<u n="291" who="S0428">and then you just have to write oh really?</u>

<u n="293" who="S0434"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="294" who="S0472">erm which is when you know erm where you go to be like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who's the guy who runs it writes all these scenarios out and all these characters and all these settings and</u>
<u n="295" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="296" who="S0472">various stuff and you all toss a coin and the combination you get decides what you get</u>
<u n="297" who="S0428" trans="overlap">write about</u>
<u n="298" who="S0472">and then you we we do it in a session so we write for ten minutes and then we all flip again and get a new something new that happens and then you have to incorporate it I don't really like that kind of stuff as much cos mm I dunno it was quite fun to do writers toss but erm the challenges if they're too specific I found them a bit like</u>
<u n="299" who="S0428">a bit like back at school</u>
<u n="300" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="301" who="S0428">yeah I think they're quite good cos I used to do them with my grandad and he's a massive writer</u>
<u n="302" who="S0472">oh</u>
<u n="303" who="S0434">oh</u>
<u n="304" who="S0428">erm but he found them like really restrictive and he found them really pressured</u>
<u n="305" who="S0472" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="306" who="S0428">especially cos you have to do these ones in ten minutes</u>
<u n="307" who="S0472">mm</u>
<u n="308" who="S0434" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="309" who="S0428">but then what I found is like it was quite difficult but then when you went back and read it</u>
<u n="310" who="S0472">mm</u>
<u n="311" who="S0428">it's like wow did I just write that in ten minutes</u>
<u n="312" who="S0472" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="313" who="S0428">so it's quite erm a good thing to</u>
<u n="314" who="S0472" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="315" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="316" who="S0428">mix up yeah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0472"><trunc>it</trunc>it's really good for like erm I did Nanowrimo I don't know if you've heard of them?</u>
<u n="318" who="S0434">er er</u>
<u n="319" who="S0472">national novel writing month</u>
<u n="320" who="S0428">oh in and there's yeah</u>
<u n="321" who="S0472">and it's every November</u>
<u n="322" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah I've heard of it</u>
<u n="323" who="S0472">loads of people in the world it's like through this website <unclear/> organisation who run it but loads of people aim to write a novel during November</u>
<u n="324" who="S0434">jeez</u>
<u n="325" who="S0472">yeah and er they they define a novel as fifty thousand words but like and so you have to turn around fifty thousand words but</u>
<u n="326" who="S0434">right</u>
<u n="327" who="S0472">erm the idea of it is cos obviously in a month you can't write a polished fifty thousand word thing</u>
<u n="328" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="329" who="S0472">and also fifty thousand words is a very short novel</u>
<u n="330" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="331" who="S0472">but the idea is is that it's a about teaching people who think of themselves as writers but get kind of stuck cos they can't</u>
<u n="332" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="333" who="S0472">they don't they don't a lot of people are like I write but never write</u>
<u n="334" who="S0428">never finish yeah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0472" trans="overlap">like</u>
<u n="336" who="S0428">and don't have the excuse and</u>
<u n="337" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="338" who="S0434" trans="overlap">but there's writing for there's writing for kind of learning and writing for writing isn't like I think people sometimes mistake the fact that because they can't turn out a polished fifty thousand word novel a month</u>
<u n="339" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="340" who="S0434">they can't turn out a polished fifty thousand word novel</u>
<u n="341" who="S0472" trans="overlap">ever yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0434">it's like no you just have that's just one bit of it like you it's never gonna be perfect in the beginning</u>
<u n="343" who="S0472">exactly</u>
<u n="344" who="S0428">mm</u>
<u n="345" who="S0434" trans="overlap">you're gonna go through drafts you're gonna have to edit you're gonna have to put it in a drawer for a week and forget about it and come back to</u>
<u n="346" who="S0472" trans="overlap">and a lot of people think writing is about the idea and it's exactly the same as like starting a business</u>
<u n="347" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="348" who="S0472">like starting a business is not about the idea it's a little bit about the idea but most of it is about how you implement the idea</u>
<u n="349" who="S0428">mm mm</u>
<u n="350" who="S0472">and writing's the same like you can have a really good idea and the problem is I I get this a lot and I don't know if it's the same for other people if you have an idea for something and you stay with the idea and try and get the idea right you never write the thing</u>
<u n="351" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="352" who="S0472">because you</u>
<u n="353" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="354" who="S0472">the idea becomes such a big thing and you don't wanna ruin it</u>
<u n="355" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and you have to explore erm</u>
<u n="356" who="S0472">and it's always gonna be better in your head than it is when you write it so what you have to do is you just have to be like that's an idea and then start writing</u>
<u n="357" who="S0434" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="358" who="S0428">and pour it out</u>
<u n="359" who="S0434">mm mm</u>
<u n="360" who="S0472" trans="overlap">and and just be rubbish and like I mean some people don't write like that some people like edit as they go along and and write each sentence really carefully</u>
<u n="361" who="S0434" trans="overlap">ah but that's really yeah I do that and it's so time-consuming and tedious and frustrating</u>
<u n="362" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="363" who="S0434">and you do feel like you never generate anything</u>
<u n="364" who="S0472" trans="overlap">er</u>
<u n="365" who="S0434">and the thing is if you if you're that kind of writer I think you do that because you're a perfectionist</u>
<u n="366" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="367" who="S0434">which means you'll do that for weeks you'll have turns out a thousand words and you still won't be happy with it so it was pointless</u>
<u n="368" who="S0472">yeah and and then you you write less because you're like well when I do it it's never right</u>
<u n="369" who="S0428" trans="overlap">exactly</u>
<u n="370" who="S0472">whereas if you put the</u>
<u n="371" who="S0434" trans="overlap">you have to learn to just gush</u>
<u n="372" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="373" who="S0472" trans="overlap">if what you expect from yourself is just turn up and write something</u>
<u n="374" who="S0434">mm mm</u>
<u n="375" who="S0472">and it some days it'll be better than others</u>
<u n="376" who="S0434">mm mm</u>
<u n="377" who="S0472">then you get into the habit of just that's the important thing</u>
<u n="378" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="379" who="S0428">and having the whole project erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was telling me something really interesting in our one to one the other day cos she's got this friend who's like he's really really successful he's done really well for himself and he has this really kind of novel approach to to doing things</u>
<u n="380" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="381" who="S0428">so so <unclear/> he makes a Powerpoint presentation he doesn't start from he he doesn't like start from the beginning and make it perfect all the way though</u>
<u n="382" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="383" who="S0428">he kind of just throws all his ideas into the Powerpoint</u>
<u n="384" who="S0472" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="385" who="S0434">I know</u>
<u n="386" who="S0428">and then he works on this search and that's <unclear/> so</u>
<u n="387" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="388" who="S0428">so at any point if someone says to him you need to do the presentation now he's got the presentation</u>
<u n="389" who="S0434">ah Interesting</u>
<u n="390" who="S0428" trans="overlap">whereas what I would do is I would kind of perfect it from the beginning</u>
<u n="391" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="392" who="S0428">but that is far better so that's the approach I'm trying to take with my master's <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="393" who="S0434" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="394" who="S0472">yeah</u>

<u n="406" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="407" who="S0472" trans="overlap">when you try and do it like that like the <trunc>in</trunc>incremental approach like you you're always feeling pressured by the fact that well what if I forget this thing further down the line and you you're thinking about what the conclusion's gonna be</u>
<u n="408" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="409" who="S0472">when you're here</u>

<u n="479" who="S0434">mm</u>

<u n="505" who="S0434" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="506" who="S0472">outside of the exam? because I think that pressure that pressure feels like it's really good</u>
<u n="507" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="508" who="S0472" trans="overlap">but it it might be rubbish</u>
<u n="509" who="S0434">but you might still write some nonsense and they might have adjusted the marking for that anyway like they</u>
<u n="510" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah they definitely do</u>
<u n="511" who="S0434">like they'll recognise the fact that you can't plan out everything and you might change tack coming through</u>
<u n="512" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="513" who="S0434">like we say about writing you just get all your ideas down and then you take a slightly different direction</u>
<u n="514" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="515" who="S0434">so</u>
<u n="516" who="S0472">but I but less about the grade but more just kinda do I write better in that situation?</u>
<u n="517" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="518" who="S0472">and I there's no way of me knowing objectively like</u>
<u n="519" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="520" who="S0472">which because I can't see what I wrote</u>
<u n="521" who="S0434">you could do a little research project do it now give yourself like an hour in a room make someone else stand over you <vocal desc="laugh"/> and give you a question to answer</u>
<u n="522" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="523" who="S0434">and compare that to what you write <unclear/> like a writing club <unclear/> week</u>
<u n="524" who="S0472" trans="overlap">because the the really interesting thing is you would just get a paper full of <trunc>questi</trunc> like full of questions</u>
<u n="525" who="S0434">uhu</u>
<u n="526" who="S0472">that you <trunc>co</trunc> that you could write essays about</u>

<u n="529" who="S0434" trans="overlap">ah and you just <unclear/></u>
<u n="530" who="S0472" trans="overlap">so yeah so <trunc>y</trunc> a lot of them a lot of them like you open the paper and you <trunc>ju</trunc> you read through the questions the first time and you get about fifteen questions</u>
<u n="531" who="S0434">mm mm</u>
<u n="532" who="S0472">you have to write about three essays in three hours</u>
<u n="533" who="S0434">right</u>
<u n="534" who="S0472">erm and erm some of them you would get in there and just read the fifteen questions and be like none none of these</u>
<u n="535" who="S0434" trans="overlap">none of the yeah</u>
<u n="536" who="S0472">because you have to quote as well an an unseen so</u>
<u n="537" who="S0434" trans="overlap">oh I see</u>
<u n="538" who="S0472">if the if it's the Shakespeare paper you you have to quote the place as you write about them</u>
<u n="539" who="S0434">oh my god</u>
<u n="540" who="S0472">about questions that you haven't known in advance</u>
<u n="541" who="S0434">so you basically have to know all the plays off by heart?</u>
<u n="542" who="S0472">basically you learn you choose some plays so so I chose like ten</u>
<u n="543" who="S0434">uhu</u>
<u n="544" who="S0472">separate plays</u>
<u n="545" who="S0434"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="546" who="S0472">that I erm that I knew that I knew really well <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="547" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="548" who="S0472"><trunc>th</trunc>thematically and could you know could talk about quite easily</u>
<u n="549" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="550" who="S0472">without quoting and then I chose erm particular verses that were very versatile</u>
<u n="551" who="S0434">right</u>
<u n="552" who="S0472">erm and learnt them</u>
<u n="553" who="S0434" trans="overlap">so you could always adapt them to something yeah</u>
<u n="554" who="S0472" trans="overlap">mm but like the last two weeks of our revision</u>
<u n="555" who="S0434" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="556" who="S0472">were just learning quotes basically</u>
<u n="557" who="S0434">jeez</u>
<u n="558" who="S0472">and I I wish I could remember them now but it's cos it was cramming</u>

<u n="560" who="S0472">you just don't remember them erm</u>
<u n="561" who="S0434">but see that's the funny thing I don't feel like I did anything at uni I had to cram for and I still don't remember it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="562" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="563" who="S0434">I remember bits but so much of it just like and I did two modules of English no er wait <trunc>tw</trunc> yeah two modules of English in my first year and I couldn't even tell you what they were</u>
<u n="564" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="565" who="S0434">I know we did Shakespeare something because that's when I first ever read erm <pause dur="short"/> winter something Winter</u>
<u n="566" who="S0472">A Winter's Tale?</u>
<u n="567" who="S0434">yeah must be that <vocal desc="laugh"/> clearly</u>
<u n="568" who="S0472" trans="overlap">it's the only one I haven't read</u>
<u n="569" who="S0434" trans="overlap">clearly it make a huge <vocal desc="laugh"/> mark left a mark on my er personality but I don't remember what I did I don't remember <unclear/> an exam for that or if it was just coursework</u>
<u n="570" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="571" who="S0434">it's so weird</u>
<u n="572" who="S0472" trans="overlap">it's weird isn't it?</u>
<u n="573" who="S0434">how much of my uni experience is just blacked out of memory</u>
<u n="574" who="S0472" trans="overlap">I get that as well though like I couldn't I I can't talk authoritatively about most periods of literature <unclear/> despite the fact that we worked through all of them</u>
<u n="575" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="576" who="S0472">and like wrote</u>
<u n="577" who="S0434" trans="overlap">no but maybe that is not despite the fact but the fact that you worked through all of them and didn't go into much depth <unclear/> then of course you can't talk authoritatively</u>
<u n="578" who="S0472" trans="overlap">oh because I have read all Shakespeare plays apart from Winter's Tale</u>
<u n="579" who="S0434">right</u>
<u n="580" who="S0472">cos we were told in the Easter holidays if so we had Easter holidays and then the Easter term was Shakespeare term in our first year and they said read the complete works in the holidays</u>
<u n="581" who="S0434">oh my god</u>
<u n="582" who="S0472">erm so it that was worked out at about a play a day</u>
<u n="583" who="S0434">wow</u>
<u n="584" who="S0472">erm so I read a play a day and</u>
<u n="585" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="586" who="S0472">in the Easter holidays</u>
<u n="587" who="S0434">except for Winter's Tale <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="589" who="S0434" trans="overlap">why did you miss that one?</u>
<u n="590" who="S0472">I don't know I think it was last alphabetically in my complete works</u>
<u n="591" who="S0434"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="592" who="S0472"><unclear/></u>
<u n="593" who="S0434">so maybe just didn't bother</u>
<u n="594" who="S0472">yeah erm</u>
<u n="595" who="S0434" trans="overlap">oh that's funny</u>
<u n="596" who="S0472">and it's quite long I seem to remember</u>
<u n="597" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="598" who="S0472">erm so I I've read them all but</u>
<u n="599" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="600" who="S0472">there's very few of them that I remember the plot or any of the characters</u>
<u n="601" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah but also if you read the entire works of Shakespeare in a a month or however long it is</u>
<u n="602" who="S0472" trans="overlap">I know and I wish they hadn't asked us to do that because</u>
<u n="603" who="S0434">did you actually need to when you got to the Shakespeare term? <event desc="background talk"/></u>
<u n="604" who="S0472">kind of cos cos supervision's then erm you are given like er an essay topic per week</u>
<u n="605" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="606" who="S0472">and you have to just write about anything</u>
<u n="607" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="608" who="S0472">so the fact that I'd read them all was quite helpful in selecting what I was gonna write about</u>
<u n="609" who="S0434">okay</u>
<u n="610" who="S0472">erm</u>
<u n="611" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="612" who="S0472">cos otherwise I wouldn't have been able to choose</u>
<u n="613" who="S0434" trans="overlap">to choose yeah</u>
<u n="614" who="S0472">erm and also we had this crazy er Shakespeare supervisor who's really famous he's died now actually but she</u>
<u n="615" who="S0434">oh</u>
<u n="616" who="S0472">she's called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and she was ninety something when she was teaching us</u>

<u n="619" who="S0434" trans="overlap">ninety something?</u>
<u n="620" who="S0472">yeah and she lived in these rooms in <anon type="place"/> with these two cats erm and never left because she was too frail</u>
<u n="621" who="S0434">ah</u>
<u n="622" who="S0472">and she would have like things delivered erm during our supervisions and she would get like crates of Smirnoff delivered</u>
<u n="623" who="S0434"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="624" who="S0472">it was like yeah erm and <vocal desc="laugh"/> and she was like she was such a hard ass like she was like</u>
<u n="625" who="S0434" trans="overlap">that's brilliant</u>
<u n="626" who="S0472">erm she would just take us down like she would just completely take us down everything we said she'd just be like no that's wrong and then quote like a massive passage she could just quote any</u>
<u n="627" who="S0434">oh my god</u>
<u n="628" who="S0472">play</u>
<u n="629" who="S0434">so I would have been <trunc>te</trunc> I think you need to have such a thick skin to study at <anon type="place"/> or <anon type="place"/> because I would be absolutely terrified and quaking just as a <trunc>pre</trunc> like</u>
<u n="630" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="631" who="S0434">I know myself when I was eighteen or nineteen</u>
<u n="632" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="633" who="S0434">if I'd had tutorials like that</u>
<u n="634" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="635" who="S0434">where lecturers for the purpose of education like I know they don't just you know bitch at people</u>
<u n="636" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="637" who="S0434">but if they absolutely slated something I really thought was important and relevant I would have cried I like I wouldn't have had a strong enough personality</u>
<u n="638" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah I cried after the first couple of supervisions but like not not because but it they it was never personal but it was they never would attack you personally they would just say well actually what you've written here is isn't correct because this this and this</u>
<u n="639" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="640" who="S0472">and the reason I cried wasn't because I felt attacked it was because I was like never gonna know enough</u>
<u n="641" who="S0434">right</u>
<u n="642" who="S0472">it was that feeling</u>
<u n="643" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="644" who="S0472">and actually that feeling is quite useful to implant in people because they then they study</u>
<u n="645" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="646" who="S0472">really hard erm</u>
<u n="647" who="S0434">but don't they also <pause dur="short"/> er isn't the anxiety just like overwhelming if you think I'm never gonna know enough</u>
<u n="648" who="S0472" trans="overlap">no because</u>
<u n="649" who="S0434">I can never finish there's no endpoint</u>
<u n="650" who="S0472">but that's the case anyway</u>
<u n="651" who="S0434" trans="overlap"><unclear/> say</u>
<u n="652" who="S0472">but isn't it? but</u>
<u n="653" who="S0434">it is but I don't think it would normally weigh on my mind so much unless someone was constantly pointing out the fact that I still had so much to learn</u>
<u n="654" who="S0472" trans="overlap">but in some ways they managed to do it in a way that doesn't make you feel like that's a negative thing</u>
<u n="655" who="S0434" trans="overlap">wow</u>
<u n="656" who="S0472">but they managed to make you feel like that just is means that that there's this open-ended world that where you could you can learn anything anytime which is quite</u>
<u n="657" who="S0434">that's quite good</u>
<u n="658" who="S0472">yeah and it's not like they're nasty it's just</u>
<u n="659" who="S0434" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="660" who="S0472">it's just academic discussion it's just like yeah</u>
<u n="661" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="662" who="S0472">no I mean I get what you're saying but actually if you consider this this and this like it that doesn't really make any sense</u>
<u n="663" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="664" who="S0472">like have you considered this?</u>
<u n="665" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="666" who="S0472">maybe you should read this</u>
<u n="667" who="S0434">you're right</u>
<u n="668" who="S0472">er</u>
<u n="669" who="S0434" trans="overlap">that's quite a skill to give feedback though like that that doesn't feel nasty or personal</u>
<u n="670" who="S0472">yeah I mean some of them did but I think</u>
<u n="671" who="S0434">ah</u>
<u n="672" who="S0472">that what your director of studies does is that they make sure basically that your first two terms you're not supervised by a monster</u>

<u n="674" who="S0472">then</u>

<u n="696" who="S0472">erm because it's just you and the other person</u>
<u n="697" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="698" who="S0472">er the the supervisor so you talk about your essay</u>
<u n="699" who="S0434" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="700" who="S0472">that's like what a supervision is and then erm hers were basically her talking at you</u>
<u n="701" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="702" who="S0472">kind of going through your essay and being like no no no</u>
<u n="703" who="S0434" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="cough"/> yeah no no no no</u>
<u n="704" who="S0472">erm and we were all really worried because our exams are coming up erm soon after it and we were like on a and then that was the paper we did the best on</u>
<u n="705" who="S0434">ha</u>
<u n="706" who="S0472">and it was like how has that even happened? like somehow by osmosis</u>
<u n="707" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="708" who="S0472">just by being attacked <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="709" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="710" who="S0472">continuously it's like</u>
<u n="711" who="S0434" trans="overlap">maybe she just made you really care about it?</u>
<u n="712" who="S0472">yeah yeah but she was yeah I don't know why I mentioned her in the first place</u>
<u n="713" who="S0434">oh we got distracted saying about Winter's Tale Shakespeare reading all those books</u>
<u n="714" who="S0472">oh yeah</u>
<u n="715" who="S0434"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="716" who="S0472">yeah yeah but she was cool she was like the only professor that I had that was like really eccentric</u>
<u n="717" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="718" who="S0472">so she's the one I always if if anyone's like did you have like a very eccentric professor and like a <unclear/> like she was the only one that would</u>
<u n="719" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah she was the <pause dur="short"/> see I didn't have anyone eccentric I had weird people at uni and amazing people but not like eccentric characters like that</u>
<u n="720" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="721" who="S0434">actually yesterday I saw erm the one of my he he lectured us on language play erm that was one of the modules one of the best modules I ever took in my linguistics degree and he was my dissertation supervisor because my undergraduate dissertation was about humour in sign languages so it was all about</u>
<u n="722" who="S0472" trans="overlap">oh wow</u>
<u n="723" who="S0434"><unclear/> for language yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="724" who="S0472" trans="overlap">that's so cool</u>
<u n="725" who="S0434">erm it was awesome I loved it I really enjoyed it and then he</u>
<u n="726" who="S0472" trans="overlap">do they do puns?</u>
<u n="727" who="S0434">that's what I was trying to find out my my kind of hypothesis which looking back actually I was really proud of this for a BA dissertation was quite an original</u>
<u n="728" who="S0472" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="729" who="S0434">research idea because you're not <unclear/> expected to be that original at BA level</u>
<u n="730" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="731" who="S0434">but I just really wanted to know I'd taken the <unclear/> course like a ten-week thing done by the students union and done a little bit of sign language and I started thinking well if you can play with the structure of the spoken word why can't you do the same with sign like a pun</u>
<u n="732" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="733" who="S0434">where the actual form of the word itself or phrase itself</u>
<u n="734" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="735" who="S0434">becomes the subject of the <unclear/> type of joke so I don't mean like using language to tell a joke cos obviously you could do that in any language</u>
<u n="736" who="S0472">yeah like a story joke</u>
<u n="737" who="S0434">but stuff like puns and plays on words</u>
<u n="738" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="739" who="S0434">and I just thought well it why couldn't you do that with sign form as well?</u>
<u n="740" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="741" who="S0434">that was my sort of hypothesis in my thesis statement</u>
<u n="742" who="S0472">so do you know sign language?</u>
<u n="743" who="S0434">er I did level one BSL but that was like ten years ago so I've I've forgotten a lot</u>
<u n="744" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="745" who="S0434">but I did my course I didn't really have to but I did a BSL level one course to inform my dissertation erm and did really well in the end by my my supervisor for that so that was why he cos language play was one of his specialist areas</u>
<u n="746" who="S0472">mm</u>
<u n="747" who="S0434">and then he actually left and he went to the <anon type="place"/> university the year that I finished so I got sort of my supervision was finished by another lady who was fine but he was just such a brilliant guy erm and called <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> funny enough</u>
<u n="748" who="S0472"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="749" who="S0434">and he's done so much stuff in linguistics and he's looking to maybe retire next year</u>
<u n="750" who="S0472">mm</u>
<u n="751" who="S0434">and I saw him yesterday at <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="752" who="S0472">ah</u>
<u n="753" who="S0434">at the conference yeah erm because he was doing some sort of colloquium or something <pause dur="short"/> and we were looking to maybe ask him to do something to write something and prepare something for us here as like a <unclear/> project</u>
<u n="754" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="755" who="S0434">and it was just so nice to see him</u>
<u n="756" who="S0472" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="757" who="S0434">and so like so I've got I've got people like that from uni who stick in my mind who we've kept in touch with like <unclear>memorable</unclear> lovely people</u>
<u n="758" who="S0472" trans="overlap">I don't have those</u>
<u n="759" who="S0434">but I didn't have like wild eccentric types</u>
<u n="760" who="S0472">I I don't have any I think one of the problems cos when we went to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s brother's graduation at <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="761" who="S0434" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="762" who="S0472">I was really struck and a bit jealous by the the <trunc>c</trunc> the close knitness of his erm geography department</u>
<u n="763" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="764" who="S0472" trans="overlap">like they were all friends and I could see that you would he would email the professors and tell them how he was getting on</u>
<u n="765" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="766" who="S0472">but the problem with how we did it was that you had different you had a different supervisor from a different college every term so first of all you only had like eight supervisions with most of them</u>
<u n="767" who="S0434">mm mm</u>
<u n="768" who="S0472">erm of an hour so and they were quite close like</u>
<u n="769" who="S0434" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="770" who="S0472">you you know it was just you</u>
<u n="771" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="772" who="S0472">so you were talking to them one to one but erm there was that but then a lot of them are also really intimidating</u>
<u n="773" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="774" who="S0472">they're not as people but like as in nineteen-year-olds</u>
<u n="775" who="S0434" trans="overlap">no but they're clearly so far away from your realms <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="776" who="S0472" trans="overlap">exactly and they're and they're not like and and and also you feel like a very small fish</u>
<u n="777" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="778" who="S0472">like I I didn't until I did well until my second year exams I felt like I was one of the dumbest people in the year</u>
<u n="779" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="780" who="S0472">which made me think why would they want to have a relationship with me like</u>
<u n="781" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="782" who="S0472">there's <trunc>p</trunc> there's stars in our year</u>
<u n="783" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="784" who="S0472">who are like getting who who I would listen to and think god they're so much smarter than me but like and they were the ones who had the close relationships with the</u>
<u n="785" who="S0434" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="786" who="S0472">professors from the er from early stages</u>
<u n="787" who="S0434" trans="overlap">that's interesting</u>
<u n="788" who="S0472">but they were the ones also who just ended up being was the fact they were more confident</u>
<u n="789" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="790" who="S0472">and that they had probably come from private school and had</u>
<u n="791" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah had kind of been coached into that mentality already</u>
<u n="792" who="S0472" trans="overlap">and the they they weren't smarter they were just more articulate</u>
<u n="793" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="794" who="S0472">because they'd been in situations like a supervision before whereas I'd</u>
<u n="795" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="796" who="S0472">only ever been in a class</u>
<u n="797" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="798" who="S0472">of thirty kids it's erm</u>
<u n="799" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="800" who="S0472">the speaking I'd done had been one point</u>
<u n="801" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="802" who="S0472">erm when I'd raised my hand</u>
<u n="803" who="S0434">yeah</u>
<u n="804" who="S0472">whereas they'd clearly had like coaching</u>
<u n="805" who="S0434" trans="overlap">they'd had one on one tuition</u>
<u n="806" who="S0472">yeah</u>
<u n="807" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="808" who="S0472">erm and so they had that confidence to be like</u>
<u n="809" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="810" who="S0472">I'm good like</u>
<u n="811" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="812" who="S0472">and you should wanna know me</u>
<u n="813" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah exactly yeah</u>
<u n="814" who="S0472">and that and that thing so I and I didn't really get that until third year like after I had a grade</u>
<u n="815" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="816" who="S0472">cos we only we only do our first official exams at the end of second year</u>
<u n="817" who="S0434">oh okay</u>
<u n="818" who="S0472" trans="overlap">and they examine the whole of the first two years</u>
<u n="819" who="S0434">wow</u>
<u n="820" who="S0472">erm so and then you get a grade and then that's part one</u>
<u n="821" who="S0434" trans="overlap">and then you feel like you've got kind of something to justify your</u>
<u n="822" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="823" who="S0434">your confidence in your own abilities yeah</u>
<u n="824" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah it's like <trunc>f</trunc> and I really like got <trunc>re</trunc> was really surprised by doing well cos I thought I thought I'd just get like a two one and like that'll be fine erm and and nobody else in my college in my year got a first</u>
<u n="825" who="S0434">wow</u>
<u n="826" who="S0472">erm and I was like I was like what?</u>
<u n="827" who="S0434" trans="overlap">that's fantastic</u>
<u n="828" who="S0472">and I thought I'd been the worst out of five</u>
<u n="829" who="S0434">mm</u>
<u n="830" who="S0472">and I was actually the best grade wise</u>
<u n="831" who="S0434" trans="overlap">wow <pause dur="short"/> that's brilliant</u>
<u n="832" who="S0472" trans="overlap">erm which is really good but it's also surprising and at that point I had a lot more confidence but then</u>
<u n="833" who="S0434" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="834" who="S0472">only had a year left so</u>
<u n="835" who="S0434">but then he also <trunc>ha</trunc> like one of the phrases that came up yesterday in the linguistics conference and it comes up a few times is this distinction between knowing that and knowing how like it's different types of knowledge so you often get the people with the big mouths who can shout it all around because they know that X Y Z but then there's knowing how there's about the process and the approach that you take and the expertise</u>
<u n="836" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="837" who="S0434">lies in the potential to do something rather than having already done something IE read a bunch of books and learned another <unclear/></u>
<u n="838" who="S0472" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="839" who="S0434">so I think and that's what shines through when you're under like intense pressure in exam conditions</u>
<u n="840" who="S0472" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="841" who="S0434">because you can't just you you you do need the knowledge but you also need to be able to apply it in a way that's appropriate for that context</u>
<u n="842" who="S0472">mm</u>
<u n="843" who="S0434">and that's not something everyone can do so</u>
<u n="844" who="S0472" trans="overlap">and the other thing is is a lot of the people who've been very closely coached in school didn't know how to organise their time</u>
<u n="845" who="S0434"><vocal desc="cough"/> right</u>
<u n="846" who="S0472">and like <pause dur="short"/> we're just like oh my god like cos most of our time we had like two or three supervisions a week and then the rest of the time you're just in the library</u>
<u n="847" who="S0434">wow</u>
<u n="848" who="S0472">so if you if you'd been spoon fed</u>
<u n="849" who="S0434"><vocal desc="gasp"/></u>
<u n="850" who="S0472">I know <unclear/> half an hour</u>
<u n="851" who="S0434" trans="overlap">I haven't had lunch yet sorry</u>
<u n="852" who="S0472">oh my god oh we should stop we should stop because I have to go as well</u>
<u n="853" who="S0434">okay <vocal desc="laugh"/> sorry</u>
<u n="854" who="S0472" trans="overlap">erm yeah</u>
<u n="855" who="S0434">alright how do we stop it?</u>
<u n="856" who="S0472"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> mm <event desc="background talk"/></u>
