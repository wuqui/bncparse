<u n="527" who="S0255">wings but er you know they weren't and I actually had whatever I had was the hot whatever and it wasn't that hot I remember we came back here one night after the beer festival and a load of people came round and we all had curries</u>
<u n="528" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="529" who="S0255">and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> always has really mild curries and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was taking the mickey out of her na na na you don't eat <unclear/> so she was saying look it's not that I can't eat a hot curry I just don't like it she said I like the flavour but I don't anything too hot she said I don't like the sensation in my mouth you know</u>
<u n="530" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="531" who="S0255">not and he was going oh right you have some of this I'll he had a phall cos in somebody like oh we're gonna have a phall have a phall yeah right <pause dur="short"/> so we're having this phall so <trunc>d</trunc> you eat some of this said you have five mouthfuls</u>

<u n="536" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="537" who="S0255">I don't she doesn't like anything too sweet too spicy <pause dur="short"/> erm too sour anything like that and I actually saw something a programme on something and it was talking about people who have the the supertasters</u>
<u n="538" who="S0257">right</u>
<u n="539" who="S0255">erm and it's this is how obviously how your taste buds are made</u>
<u n="540" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="541" who="S0255">but you taste things more concentrated almost than other people so something that you would taste and it's really sweet they taste it as extremely sweet</u>
<u n="542" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="543" who="S0255">so <trunc>w</trunc> that it makes sense because I'll eat the the sweetest stickiest sickliest puddings and I'll have seconds and go back for thirds she'll eat half a bowl of it because she says it it's just it's too er like overwhelming too much</u>
<u n="544" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="545" who="S0255">and so I think that it might be that with her</u>
<u n="546" who="S0257">oh</u>
<u n="547" who="S0255">I think she might be one of these supertasters</u>
<u n="548" who="S0257">yeah possibly then</u>
<u n="549" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm so she said she'd be quite good going in as like a tasting thing for something like having a job doing that</u>
<u n="550" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="551" who="S0255">like the perfume smellers or somebody who's who tastes things</u>
<u n="552" who="S0257">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="553" who="S0255" trans="overlap">but she said she'd actually sort of get the extreme thing of you know of the taste so</u>
<u n="554" who="S0257">see I'm <pause dur="short"/> I can eat very hot food but like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I prefer I prefer to taste what I'm eating</u>
<u n="555" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="556" who="S0257">so <trunc>wh</trunc>when we make our our curries we do put a lot of spices in but we put er them in there for flavour as well as heat</u>
<u n="557" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="558" who="S0257">and we always have chilli in there but it it's always for the taste</u>
<u n="559" who="S0255">yeah <event desc="sound of bell"/> oh</u>
<u n="560" who="S0257">and I don't understand these people that have to have always have to have the hottest to prove a point because they're not</u>
<u n="561" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="562" who="S0257">necessarily enjoying</u>

<u n="1793" who="S0255">yeah</u>

<u n="1795" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="1796" who="S0257">and I said well you need a TV aerial and I went oh well you know that's that's tough then really I think I'd already priced it just in case and I and I said I'd been told it's about a hundred and twenty pounds</u>

<u n="1798" who="S0257">er and he said well what if we pay ninety of that? straight off what if we pay ninety would you stay with us?</u>

<u n="1800" who="S0257">and like I said well you've given me something to think about it I'll have to go away and think about it which we did and then I thought well I'm gonna have to take a day off work</u>
<u n="1801" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="1802" who="S0257">to wait for some aerial man to come along to install it</u>

<u n="1806" who="S0257">and I'd rung up and I'd given them all the details about the phone the broadband and the TV so the phone was <trunc>fi</trunc> no the TV was fine but had no phone or broadband and they said well you didn't order it I said I did I did it all at the same time how come my TV is working absolutely fine?</u>
<u n="1807" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="1808" who="S0257">and I this woman was so obnoxious that I asked to speak to her supervisor and the supervisor was so downright rude</u>
<u n="1809" who="S0255">mm</u>

<u n="1815" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="1816" who="S0257" trans="overlap">has now lost you a customer</u>
<u n="1817" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="1818" who="S0257">and she didn't apologise nothing she <trunc>ju</trunc> she just kept saying to me well you didn't do it properly you didn't order it you didn't order</u>
<u n="1819" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="1820" who="S0257">er I did</u>
<u n="1821" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="1822" who="S0257">I know I did</u>
<u n="1823" who="S0255">the thing is when you ring a call centre if you ask to speak to a supervisor you just get put onto another person at the call centre</u>
<u n="1824" who="S0257" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1825" who="S0255">that</u>
<u n="1826" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="1827" who="S0255">they just say yeah I'm the supervisor</u>
<u n="1828" who="S0257" trans="overlap">it's another voice isn't it?</u>
<u n="1829" who="S0255">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="1830" who="S0257" trans="overlap">yeah that's it</u>
<u n="1831" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="1832" who="S0257">precisely</u>
<u n="1833" who="S0255">mm well no we have Sky erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s had it sort of since day one</u>
<u n="1834" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="1835" who="S0255">and he's always had the full package cos you know he's he's biggest is best you have this you do you know</u>
<u n="1836" who="S0257" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1837" who="S0255" trans="overlap">etcetera although more recently he's starting to look and go well actually you know it cos it <trunc>kee</trunc> like you say it keeps going up and going up</u>
<u n="1838" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="1839" who="S0255">and all of sudden we're paying oh eighty odd pound a month</u>
<u n="1840" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="1841" who="S0255">we've got the second box which means well when <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> were here they could watch it in another room whereas now</u>
<u n="1842" who="S0257" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1843" who="S0255"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> just uses it all the time</u>
<u n="1844" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="1845" who="S0255">but then we take it to the caravan in the summer when we go backwards and forwards at the weekends we take it with us and we actually take it over to France now when we go over to there and we have it over there so</u>
<u n="1846" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="1847" who="S0255">I think fair enough you know we we are using it so it's worth having a second box</u>
<u n="1848" who="S0257">yeah</u>
<u n="1849" who="S0255">but erm when you whenever he rings and says you know this is ridiculous it's so expensive I'm I think I'm gonna cancel it they then say oh well we'll give you a discounted rate for so long or knock some money off and do that</u>
<u n="1850" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="1851" who="S0255">but the way they've set the packages up if you have all of them except for the movies you might as well have the movies as well or if you just cancel cos you have to cancel almost all of it and go down to a basic package</u>
<u n="1852" who="S0257">yes</u>
<u n="1853" who="S0255" trans="overlap">for it to be a lot cheaper</u>
<u n="1854" who="S0257">well that's what we started looking at I think it said</u>
<u n="1855" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1856" who="S0257">you go up eight eight channels was it? so you you still get all your terrestrial channels</u>
<u n="1857" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="1858" who="S0257">and you still get all the free to view ones</u>
<u n="1859" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="1860" who="S0257">but then there was something like eight very basic ones and I said to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> that would probably do us and he said</u>
<u n="1861" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1862" who="S0257">as long as I get this this this</u>
<u n="1863" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="1864" who="S0257">I'm happy and it literally was about three different channels</u>
<u n="1865" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="1866" who="S0257">along with the sports package <pause dur="long"/> and I couldn't particularly think of anything <pause dur="short"/> it's very rare that I'll say oh I wanna watch that</u>
<u n="1867" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="1868" who="S0257">and if I do it's something like Dara O Briain School of Hard Sums or</u>
<u n="1869" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="1870" who="S0257">the science one that he did or Great British Bake Off</u>
<u n="1871" who="S0255">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> we tend to find</u>
<u n="1872" who="S0257">very easily lose</u>
<u n="1873" who="S0255" trans="overlap">we take <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> watches some of the sport but he gets so annoyed because you have to pay so much money for Sky Sports</u>
<u n="1874" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="1875" who="S0255" trans="overlap">because it's mainly for Premier football</u>
<u n="1876" who="S0257">mm</u>

<u n="1880" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="1881" who="S0255">but you have to have that because they split everything else on all the other ones so you have to end up <trunc>ca</trunc> you know you can't just have one of the sports things</u>
<u n="1882" who="S0257" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1883" who="S0255">you have to have all the sports ones</u>

<u n="1886" who="S0257">including Sky er Sports News</u>

<u n="2100" who="S0257">mm</u>
<u n="2101" who="S0255">but he won't think where to me something is quite logical that if someone's coming past here and we're going somewhere and they've said at other times if we wanted a lift if we say oh we're going to you know do you <trunc>fa</trunc>? you know can you pick us up or do you wanna pop it <trunc>rou</trunc> off drop it off as you you know somebody that works in town and drives out this way to go to <anon type="place"/> to go home</u>
