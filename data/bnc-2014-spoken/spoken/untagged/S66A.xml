<u n="1062" who="S0151" trans="overlap">but he's almost <pause dur="short"/> he's basically no I was just <trunc>amaze</trunc> I was just amazed that he said something like that</u>

<u n="1064" who="S0151">yeah you should make an official complaint about it if you think I'm having a go at my staff and then erm he was with her half an hour an hour later he's like I'm really sorry about that <pause dur="short"/> I really appreciate the stuff that you're doing erm</u>

<u n="1071" who="S0097"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> did it</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0179">he</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0097"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has probably done it surreptitiously</u>
<u n="1074" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1075" who="S0151">this is why <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> just doesn't I I don't talk to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> we are behind each other so <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>

<u n="1085" who="S0097">needs separate himself from the minions <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0179">the erm another question erm so why why this erm immunity on <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s behalf?</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0097">just because she she couldn't say anything you know?</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0151">yeah</u>
