<u n="17" who="S0457" trans="overlap">he he probably yeah cos it was it's not actually sticking out it is</u>
<u n="18" who="S0456">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0457">it's flat on the window so if you</u>
<u n="20" who="S0456">well even I noticed it so?</u>
<u n="21" who="S0457">I know but he drives in the car doesn't he Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> he's old</u>
<u n="22" who="S0458">I've seen him walking down the street before</u>
<u n="23" who="S0457">me too</u>
<u n="24" who="S0456">I see now he realises if I walk I might see any for sale signs</u>
<u n="25" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0457">yeah too late yeah it's gone mm never mind</u>
<u n="27" who="S0458">no mm unless he can find out who's bought buying it and have a good</u>
<u n="28" who="S0456">make a better offer</u>
<u n="29" who="S0458">it's never too late is it?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0457">mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0456">mm yeah I think by the fire station they're building something because I saw them remember opposite you know the fire station and gym</u>
<u n="32" who="S0457">yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0456">and there's a bit of waste ground and the old ruin of a pub</u>
<u n="34" who="S0457">oh I know yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0456">and it was just always fenced off</u>
<u n="36" who="S0457">yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0456">and just waste ground but today when I went passed they were digging it up so I think they're they're laying foundations</u>
<u n="38" who="S0457" trans="overlap">oh are they?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0457">I wonder what that's going to be?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0456">be more flats cos obviously they've got two rows of flats</u>
<u n="41" who="S0458">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0456">and then the new ones further down the road</u>
<u n="43" who="S0457">yeah <anon type="place"/> court</u>
<u n="44" who="S0458">yeah mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0457">mm</u>

<u n="51" who="S0457" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0456">so nobody could trace who actually is in charge of the building and therefore could be made liable and I think either it was a change of law or if you can say that it's been not cared for for so many years and the council can step in and that's when the put the fence up</u>
<u n="53" who="S0457" trans="overlap">yeah oh I see</u>
<u n="54" who="S0456">but it took it took and obviously loads of people must have complained</u>
