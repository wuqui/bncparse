<u n="62" who="S0269">erm <pause dur="long"/> it was about the noise but there were various other issues that hasn't been finished off I think</u>
<u n="63" who="S0268">was it because of what we found or and they didn't have the figures? <pause dur="short"/> I can't can you remember that dear? can you remember what that was about?</u>
<u n="64" who="S0266">er sorry I wasn't listening</u>

<u n="67" who="S0268"><unclear/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0266" trans="overlap">the whole report had to be rewritten the initial planners do you remember? that was a very early on <pause dur="short"/> erm thing they had to <trunc>r</trunc> they had to stop the planning meeting because the report had to be rewritten</u>
<u n="69" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0266"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s wasn't good enough</u>
<u n="71" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0266">is that what you're not talking about that?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0269">no we're erm we're talking about the <pause dur="short"/> er planning appeal rather than the</u>
<u n="74" who="S0268" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="75" who="S0269">development control committee</u>
<u n="76" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0269">the the development control committee meeting was put off</u>
<u n="78" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0269">it was scheduled for a February</u>
<u n="80" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0269">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <trunc>ref</trunc> had refused to provide additional information that had been requested on noise</u>
<u n="82" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0269">and the day before the DCC meeting <pause dur="short"/> he mysteriously pulled a rabbit out of a hat and said here's the additional information and if you recall <anon type="place"/> council er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> at the DCC meeting the following day pronounced himself totally satisfied with the information that had been provided by Ecotricity and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> er queried that</u>
<u n="84" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0269">and demanded to know and that's when it was adjourned for a month then but that was the DCC meeting rather than</u>
<u n="86" who="S0268" trans="overlap">but and <trunc>th</trunc>then it was kicked down the <trunc>roa</trunc> down down the road for five months wasn't it or something like that and I think that was a noise issue</u>
<u n="87" who="S0269">yeah I think that would <trunc>b</trunc> erm <pause dur="short"/> we're just talking about the DCC meeting being deferred then it went to planning <pause dur="short"/> appeal but there was a long gap between the DCC meeting and the planning er appeal because Ecotricity didn't register it in the <trunc>v</trunc> the appeal until the very last minute</u>
<u n="88" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="89" who="S0269">they were allowed six months and I think they submitted it in month six</u>
<u n="90" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0269">and then erm I think that was about September and then they were trying to get dates for the er planning inspector <pause dur="short"/> and I think the meeting started in January the next</u>
<u n="92" who="S0268" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0269">so there was eleven months from the first DCC meeting</u>
<u n="94" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0269">erm <pause dur="short"/> and the the initial estimate was four days that was given by Ecotricity's barrister</u>
<u n="96" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0269">that it would be four days <pause dur="short"/> erm so they were trying to find dates <pause dur="short"/> and then it became apparent on about day three or four that it was gonna take a lot longer than erm than four days</u>
<u n="98" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0269" trans="overlap">and then they couldn't <pause dur="short"/> because of erm <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> being involved in the other</u>
<u n="100" who="S0268" trans="overlap">another one yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0269">down at <anon type="place"/> they couldn't er get a day</u>
<u n="102" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="103" who="S0269">so there were another few months went er went by</u>
<u n="104" who="S0268">the those are the tactics that they need to do</u>
<u n="105" who="S0269">yeah and this is what I was trying to get across to them last night because</u>
<u n="106" who="S0268" trans="overlap">but I I sort of take <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s view that they are probably not as organised</u>
<u n="107" who="S0269">no I don't think they are</u>
<u n="108" who="S0268">with the the</u>
<u n="109" who="S0269" trans="overlap">but to be fair</u>
<u n="110" who="S0268" trans="overlap">the <trunc>op</trunc> no the <trunc>opposit</trunc> the erm the <trunc>pl</trunc> the er</u>
<u n="111" who="S0269" trans="overlap">both parties</u>
<u n="112" who="S0268">developers well both parties could be</u>
<u n="113" who="S0269" trans="overlap">well yeah oh oh oh there's no doubt that the developers are not on the same league as</u>
<u n="114" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="115" who="S0269">Ecotricity because this is probably the first or second one that they've done</u>
<u n="116" who="S0268">yeah yeah exactly</u>
<u n="117" who="S0269" trans="overlap">I may be getting the applications mixed up but I think this company was only formed erm two months before the</u>
<u n="118" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0269">the thing surfaced</u>
<u n="120" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0269">so they are not in the same league as Ecotrocity</u>
<u n="122" who="S0268">and they're not in the same league as you</u>
<u n="123" who="S0269">well we started off knowing nothing to be fair</u>
<u n="124" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0269">when it dropped through our letterbox in July twenty O nine it was phew what's this?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0269">and nobody knew about it</u>
<u n="128" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0269">apart from your next door neighbour</u>
<u n="130" who="S0268">mm yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0269">and the farmer</u>
<u n="132" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0269">erm so we started from a pretty low base</u>
<u n="134" who="S0268">and that was all in two thousand and nine?</u>
<u n="135" who="S0269">that was two thousand and nine so very quickly we got ourselves organised</u>
<u n="136" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0269">and right fellas let's get as much information <pause dur="short"/> as as we can</u>
<u n="138" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="139" who="S0269">on everything</u>
<u n="140" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0269">on the company and</u>
<u n="142" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0269">what a wind turbine is and what it does and</u>
<u n="144" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0269">visuals and everything <pause dur="short"/> er and then we were er we started researching Ecotricity <pause dur="short"/> erm A on the accounts and B the relationships with people at <anon type="place"/> and that's why we ended up with <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> in er <pause dur="short"/> march twenty ten I think that was</u>
<u n="146" who="S0268" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0269">erm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0268">and you and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> went to see him didn't you?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0269"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> and I went to see him</u>
<u n="150" who="S0268" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="151" who="S0269">and we had two rehearsals before we <pause dur="short"/> er went there and <pause dur="short"/> the catalyst for going to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was the <pause dur="short"/> er monitoring mast it wasn't the turbines it was the monitoring mast</u>
<u n="152" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0269">and from our research it it how it all came about at this Climate Change Panel</u>
<u n="154" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0269">so then we went down that route of the Climate Change Panel of the CVs of all the</u>
<u n="156" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0269">people on the Independent Climate Change Panel</u>
<u n="158" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0269">who we have international national and local climate change experts</u>
<u n="160" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="161" who="S0269">but they forgot to tell us that two of them were employed by Ecotricity and two of them were school kids</u>
<u n="162" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0269">and another one was a guy who filtered the muck out of chip shop fat</u>
<u n="164" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0269">and ran an old bus on it</u>
<u n="166" who="S0268">and a vicar</u>

<u n="168" who="S0268"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="169" who="S0269">so that's when we went to see <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who <pause dur="short"/> professed not to know <vocal desc="laugh"/> anything about it and I can <vocal desc="laugh"/> now believe that he didn't know anything about <pause dur="short"/> erm and we complained to him about the very close relationship between two of his senior officers and <unclear>Darwind's</unclear></u>
<u n="170" who="S0268">but last night they didn't seem to know <pause dur="short"/> anything about this cumulative thing on <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="171" who="S0269">that's right</u>
<u n="172" who="S0268"><trunc>sh</trunc>shouldn't they <trunc>h</trunc>how</u>
<u n="173" who="S0266">I think they did know something about it</u>
<u n="174" who="S0269">but he the the chairman</u>
<u n="175" who="S0266" trans="overlap">cos someone referred to it</u>

<u n="182" who="S0266" trans="overlap">the word cumulative</u>
<u n="183" who="S0269">that's right what I don't know is whether the letter from <anon type="place"/> to the developers talking about the cumulative impact had come as a result of me going to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="184" who="S0268" trans="overlap">well yeah</u>
<u n="185" who="S0269" trans="overlap">making representations to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> because initially <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had written to all the developers and saying they weren't required</u>
<u n="186" who="S0268">but my reading of that and cos you showed me the letter</u>
<u n="187" who="S0269">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0268">was that they they will have to do <pause dur="short"/> an environmental impact assessment</u>

<u n="213" who="S0269" trans="overlap">that's right</u>

<u n="216" who="S0268">you know to do it</u>
<u n="217" who="S0269" trans="overlap">well the thing the thing that was I was trying to get across last night was there are a small number of things that you ought to do one is <pause dur="short"/> everything you can to reduce the revenue stream</u>
<u n="218" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="219" who="S0269">less turbines less solar panels</u>

<u n="222" who="S0268" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="223" who="S0269">er the second thing that you do is put as much cost on them as you can</u>
<u n="224" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="225" who="S0269">and this is why we advertised for a heritage expert for save <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="226" who="S0268">and the noise I mean that must have</u>

<u n="232" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="233" who="S0269">the</u>

<u n="237" who="S0269">yeah</u>
<u n="238" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="239" who="S0269">so you can double so the fifty thousand pounds you can</u>

<u n="241" who="S0269">you can double it</u>
<u n="242" who="S0268">that's what you did mm</u>

<u n="244" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="245" who="S0269">cos there's force as much cost on the other side as you can</u>
<u n="246" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="247" who="S0269">erm <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> well <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s <pause dur="short"/> estimate for the total cost for the other side was two hundred and fifty thousand quid</u>

<u n="250" who="S0268">mm mm</u>
<u n="251" who="S0269">and there's the other thing was to duck and dive and put the pressure on the local planning authority <pause dur="short"/> because they came at it right from the start they were determined to get planning permission for wind turbines in <pause dur="short"/> in <anon type="place"/> district</u>

<u n="256" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="257" who="S0269">but I'm sure that's what they ought to be doing up there <pause dur="short"/> try and get the revenue out of them by a reduced proposal er and force costs on them and EIA pushes significant costs on them because I don't believe they've got the capability of doing it themselves</u>
<u n="258" who="S0268">mm</u>

<u n="274" who="S0269" trans="overlap">well <pause dur="short"/> well I <trunc>th</trunc> that was my recommendation to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="275" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="276" who="S0269">er <trunc>w</trunc>was to try and persuade the local planning authority to employ a landscape consultant which they didn't do for the turbines</u>
<u n="277" who="S0268">mm</u>

<u n="282" who="S0269">well that's what I hope <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is doing</u>

<u n="437" who="S0266" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="438" who="S0269" trans="overlap">imagine it's only <pause dur="short"/> percentage in single figures relative to subsidies for wind turbines and <pause dur="short"/> solar panels</u>
<u n="439" who="S0266">really? but that's wrong isn't it?</u>
<u n="440" who="S0269">I think it's wrong I I think the the priority</u>
<u n="441" who="S0266">I mean as a taxpayer</u>
<u n="442" who="S0269" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="443" who="S0266" trans="overlap">wouldn't it be better or as a</u>
<u n="444" who="S0269" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="445" who="S0266" trans="overlap">you know</u>
<u n="446" who="S0269">yeah I I think it I think it would er but as long as the people in charge of the shop think otherwise we've <pause dur="short"/> we've got a problem but I would have said that you were better off putting your money into basic research to er be able to store find a way of storing electricity er and a way of generating it from the power of the sun but not putting acres of solar panels down over fields is not the way forward <pause dur="short"/> in my book</u>
<u n="447" who="S0266">have they done that in America?</u>
<u n="448" who="S0268">they still do the same stuff there though don't they? they the</u>
<u n="449" who="S0266" trans="overlap">no but they've gone ahead with fracking haven't they?</u>
<u n="450" who="S0269">well</u>
<u n="451" who="S0268" trans="overlap">yeah but the desert</u>
<u n="452" who="S0269">mm</u>
<u n="453" who="S0268">they've got those panels in the desert</u>
<u n="454" who="S0269">yeah that's right I think well in fact one er one possible way for us if you put the solar panels in the Sahara Desert near the equator on a couple of wires erm and develop a way of transmitting electricity that's <pause dur="short"/> doesn't result in too too many losses it's probably a better way of doing it <pause dur="short"/> cos you'll generate far more from a solar panel on the equator than you will at the latitude we're at</u>
<u n="455" who="S0268" trans="overlap">but you're gonna lose a lot of electricity over that transmission to just as</u>
<u n="456" who="S0269" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="457" who="S0268">how much would you lose?</u>
<u n="458" who="S0269">well</u>
<u n="459" who="S0268">a lot?</u>
<u n="460" who="S0269">well it would be more than ten percent I would think</u>
<u n="461" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="462" who="S0269">it er it er yeah probably quite a bit more than ten percent because you're losing in the grid system in the UK with the typical transmission losses will be about eight percent I would think</u>
<u n="463" who="S0268">and it's gotta go under the sea at one point</u>
<u n="464" who="S0269">yeah and putting it under <pause dur="short"/> putting it underground or under sea is very very expensive</u>
<u n="465" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="466" who="S0269">cos people don't realise how much heat</u>
<u n="467" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="468" who="S0269">is comes off power wires</u>
<u n="469" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="470" who="S0269">erm if it's underground you've gotta put it in cooling water the cables</u>
<u n="471" who="S0268">and people who don't like us can cut it</u>
<u n="472" who="S0269">well <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="473" who="S0268">cut the wires</u>
<u n="474" who="S0269" trans="overlap">yeah that's a good that's a good point yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="475" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="476" who="S0269">so as far as possible try and be self-sufficient</u>
<u n="477" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="478" who="S0269">but then with the Scottish referendum er coming along there may be somebody cutting the wires or it may be us and not them <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="479" who="S0268">well that's another <pause dur="short"/> vexed subject</u>
<u n="480" who="S0269"><vocal desc="laugh"/> indeed</u>
<u n="481" who="S0268">mm <pause dur="short"/> I think do you think they're getting worried now politicians? cos there's possibilities that it's gonna go independent?</u>
<u n="482" who="S0269">I think you're gonna get a I think the vote will be no rather than yes but it'll be fairly close and therefore the <pause dur="short"/> the arguing is gonna go on and on and on and on</u>
<u n="483" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="484" who="S0269">there is one merit in having a yes vote is that right that's it <pause dur="short"/> but if you've got a no vote</u>
<u n="485" who="S0268" trans="overlap">mm they'll try again</u>
<u n="486" who="S0269">we'll keep trying and trying and trying until everybody</u>
<u n="487" who="S0268">until we get the right answer</u>
<u n="488" who="S0269" trans="overlap">falls over yeah that's right</u>
<u n="489" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="490" who="S0269">till they get the right answer</u>
<u n="491" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="492" who="S0269">erm <pause dur="short"/> but if that's what they want</u>
<u n="493" who="S0268">they were saying at lunchtime on the radio that if it's a yes vote Cameron's gonna lose his job <pause dur="short"/> cos he had it's</u>

<u n="501" who="S0268">plus you've got the Clacton by-election</u>
<u n="502" who="S0269">well that that's right but erm that result may be a bit closer than what people are currently predicting mind they're currently predicting sixty-four percent of the people who vote for the Ukip and twenty-three'll vote for</u>
<u n="503" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="504" who="S0269">for the Conservative but I don't see that well you see what's what's forgotten in on this Scottish erm referendum thing is if you go back to the last er General Election I think I'm right in saying that the Scottish Conservatives got more votes than the Scottish Nationalists</u>
<u n="505" who="S0268">if you go back when?</u>
<u n="506" who="S0269">to twenty ten</u>
<u n="507" who="S0268">mm <pause dur="short"/> really?</u>

<u n="512" who="S0269">well that's a figure that stuck in my mind</u>

<u n="514" who="S0269">yeah</u>
<u n="515" who="S0268">mm I thought that</u>
<u n="516" who="S0269" trans="overlap">I'll go back home and check that</u>
<u n="517" who="S0268" trans="overlap">I thought they were a a kind of erm an endangered species Conservatives in Scotland</u>

<u n="519" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="520" who="S0269">cos it all depends how your individual votes are spread around don't it?</u>
<u n="521" who="S0268">oh right okay <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> no doubt it's I I find that difficult to believe</u>
