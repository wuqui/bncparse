<u n="119" who="S0439">I think they'll be fine hun I don't think you can go too wrong with an egg</u>
<u n="120" who="S0441">no but I suppose if if they're not done then that's a complete waste of an egg</u>
<u n="121" who="S0439">dad normally no dad just normally leaves them like in the pan for a while</u>
<u n="122" who="S0441">oh does he? what? to continue cooking for a bit</u>
<u n="123" who="S0439">just yeah like turn it off the boil and then just leave them in there for like a few minutes and then drain the water and you can just leave them in the pan they will continue to cook cos it's an egg so it's not like it will go hard</u>
<u n="124" who="S0441" trans="overlap">yeah yeah it's still hot isn't it? yeah okay</u>
<u n="125" who="S0439">so don't worry it's all good I love peeling hard boiled eggs that's one of the most like satisfying things to do as sad as that sounds god I'm a loser</u>
<u n="126" who="S0441">oh it says this says partially fill a bowl with ice cubes in water leave the enough room blah blah blah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0439">blah blah blah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0441">use a slotted slotted spoon to transfer the hot eggs immediately into cold water and then leave them to cool for ten minutes and then they'll be really easy to peel apparently</u>
<u n="129" who="S0439">yeah it's the opposite of tomatoes isn't it? cos tomatoes you're supposed to put in boiling water then the skin comes off really easily</u>
<u n="130" who="S0441">yeah yes well you learn something new every day</u>
<u n="131" who="S0439">life is a learning curve</u>
<u n="132" who="S0441" trans="overlap">it's a life skill hard boiled eggs</u>
<u n="133" who="S0439">I love that you got to the grand old age of twenty-four and you've never boiled a hard boiled an egg before</u>
<u n="134" who="S0441">I've never really needed if I if I wanted an egg salad I'd probably buy it</u>
<u n="135" who="S0439">yeah true</u>
<u n="136" who="S0441">but</u>
<u n="137" who="S0439">and I've never wanted an egg sandwich so</u>

<u n="140" who="S0441">no idea</u>
<u n="141" who="S0439">why would I know that I have to use white spirit to clean a brush I've never done painting before in my life like why would I know that? <vocal desc="laugh"/> he's like well it's common sense really and she's like how is it common sense? if I if I've never</u>
<u n="142" who="S0441" trans="overlap">it's only common sense if you know it</u>
<u n="143" who="S0439">yeah <pause dur="short"/> he was like hand me the spanner cos they were building a bookcase or something she's like here she handed him like a spanner but he's like not that spanner and she's like</u>

<u n="146" who="S0441">oh dear joys of DIY</u>
<u n="147" who="S0439">I know she erm she went home this weekend obviously and then she came back today and she was a bit sad and she's like her parents were arguing really badly</u>
<u n="148" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0439">and she's just like she <trunc>sai</trunc> she said I think my parents are gonna like maybe get a divorce or something</u>
<u n="150" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0439">and I was just like god I couldn't imagine my parents getting I know the <trunc>ar</trunc> like they argue and stuff and they've been like like they've been like close over the years to maybe splitting up but I never I can't imagine my parents getting a divorce I'd be really upset I think <pause dur="short"/> if they did it now</u>
<u n="152" who="S0441" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> I suppose but it doesn't really change anything really <pause dur="short"/> well it changes that they live apart</u>
<u n="153" who="S0439">yeah no no yeah I get that but I don't know I just feel like without them being it's not the same</u>
<u n="154" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0439">I don't know</u>
<u n="156" who="S0441">yeah I suppose but then</u>
<u n="157" who="S0439">I'd rather them be happy apart than like be miserable together definitely</u>
<u n="158" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="159" who="S0439">but no if my parents would divorce I'd be well upset</u>
<u n="160" who="S0441">yeah it's weird</u>
<u n="161" who="S0439">I guess it's like easier when you're not like young as in like your age but if you were like if your parents separated when you were like two or something cos then you would never know your parents together</u>
<u n="162" who="S0441">I think it would be easier if you were older if you're younger</u>
<u n="163" who="S0439">do you think?</u>
<u n="164" who="S0441">you always wonder why do you know what I mean and you never grow up with a normal family so</u>
<u n="165" who="S0439">but then I guess that's what your definition of normal would be wouldn't it? like your parents live apart</u>
<u n="166" who="S0441">not if all your friends had all like their friends like their families together I suppose</u>
<u n="167" who="S0439">true but it's weird how nowadays most people not most people that's a complete generalisation but a lot of people actually their parents aren't together it's like becoming weirder having not weirder but it's becoming less common to have your parents still together is some places</u>
<u n="168" who="S0441" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="169" who="S0439">it's really peculiar</u>

<u n="219" who="S0439">yeah I <trunc>ki</trunc> I met him and he didn't say anything to me and then came across as really special</u>
<u n="220" who="S0441">that's probably because he was a bit embarrassed I imagine as well</u>
<u n="221" who="S0439">because he behaved like a complete knob</u>
<u n="222" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="223" who="S0439">and he's like and it was really ironic I was like erm you know I can't believe you've given people this bad perception of me and it's no dude the person who is giving yourself a bad you know perception</u>

<u n="250" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="251" who="S0439">and then basically he can't get it up</u>
<u n="252" who="S0441">okay so like they're definitely not a <unclear>match are they at all</unclear>?</u>

<u n="299" who="S0439" trans="overlap">there's just not that attraction maybe they're trying to force it</u>

<u n="305" who="S0439">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="306" who="S0441">I'd sort of think mm there's probably an issue there like</u>

<u n="386" who="S0441">not only are you doing a bloody running race</u>
<u n="387" who="S0439">exactly and then like the queue for the toilet was massive so I had to nip into a local pub I was like now I look like an alchy at like eleven o'clock in the morning going into a pub I was like ah manic <pause dur="short"/> but oh well I did it competed and did my personal best I got fifty-six minutes</u>

<u n="399" who="S0439">what do they say?</u>
<u n="400" who="S0441">it's easier to peel an egg that has been cracked all over</u>
<u n="401" who="S0439">ah no sometimes I roll it a little bit just to get the cracking started and then you start picking it I wouldn't say crack all over though</u>
<u n="402" who="S0441">mm lean it on its side and apply light pressure with your hand as you roll it against the counter this will crack the shell around the egg begin peeling at the large end of the egg there's an air pocket at the end so it's easier to get started without moving the egg white along the shell</u>
<u n="403" who="S0439">that makes sense</u>
<u n="404" who="S0441">try to get under the <trunc>l</trunc> lift it from the egg</u>
<u n="405" who="S0439">do you like the membrane?</u>
