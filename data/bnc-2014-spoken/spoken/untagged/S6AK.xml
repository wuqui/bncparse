<u n="707" who="S0013">yes <pause dur="short"/> we did <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="708" who="S0012">walking in the forest <anon type="place"/> every day</u>
<u n="709" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="710" who="S0012">you couldn't get lost there because the A3 <pause dur="short"/> went straight past the <anon type="place"/> <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/> or <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="711" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah we didn't know about that <unclear>one you'll</unclear></u>
<u n="712" who="S0012">but you could hear it when we were in the woods <pause dur="short"/> so you knew where</u>
<u n="713" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="714" who="S0012">you could hear but they now put a tunnel <pause dur="short"/> underneath it <pause dur="short"/> so that er that</u>
<u n="715" who="S0013" trans="overlap">was it big enough? no</u>
<u n="716" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so the the whole <anon type="place"/> become bigger they're taking up the road and they've put a tunnel underneath it <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="717" who="S0152">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's amazing what they can do <pause dur="short"/> don't know if you've seen the <pause dur="short"/> do you watch that programme about the cross link er tube line they put in?</u>
<u n="718" who="S0012" trans="overlap">the tube line yeah I saw someone but yeah</u>
<u n="719" who="S0152">ah amazing</u>
<u n="720" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="721" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="722" who="S0152">absolutely amazing</u>
<u n="723" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="724" who="S0152">all the tunnels are now <trunc>d</trunc>dug</u>
<u n="725" who="S0012">yeah and er</u>
<u n="726" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="727" who="S0152">they're all dug <pause dur="short"/> and they're just <trunc>g</trunc> he's gonna take another two year another three years to kick them all out now</u>
<u n="728" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="729" who="S0152">lay all the tracks and everything</u>
<u n="730" who="S0012">cor <pause dur="short"/> that's fantastic though ain't it?</u>
<u n="731" who="S0013" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="732" who="S0152">great big boring machine the way that it does it</u>
<u n="733" who="S0012" trans="overlap">they're huge</u>
<u n="734" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="735" who="S0012">they and and they <trunc>co</trunc> they keep putting concrete</u>
<u n="736" who="S0152"><unclear>pillars</unclear> and <trunc>y</trunc> and you have and you have keystone at the end of it</u>
<u n="737" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="738" who="S0152">amazing I cos I showed <pause dur="short"/> cos I've been making <pause dur="short"/> structures <pause dur="short"/> so a bridge an arch bridge</u>
<u n="739" who="S0012">oh yeah</u>
<u n="740" who="S0152">and the so the idea is the accuracy that they have to bend the paper they have to fold it</u>
<u n="741" who="S0013">oh right</u>
<u n="742" who="S0152">and then they have to make the keystone to put in and then we put weights on to see</u>
<u n="743" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="744" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="745" who="S0152">what isn't</u>
<u n="746" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="747" who="S0152">and what happens if you don't have the pillar either side</u>
<u n="748" who="S0012">that's it yeah</u>
<u n="749" who="S0152">in the thing <pause dur="short"/> and then I'd seen</u>
<u n="750" who="S0013" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="751" who="S0152">something on TV about it <pause dur="short"/> and it showed them putting the big concrete blocks in and they says and the last concrete box is the keystone that keeps them all together</u>
<u n="752" who="S0012">all together yeah</u>
<u n="753" who="S0152" trans="overlap">so I show them that old technology's still being used</u>
<u n="754" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="755" who="S0152">even now</u>
<u n="756" who="S0012">yes it is yeah</u>
<u n="757" who="S0013" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="758" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="759" who="S0152">but they some of the areas they have to drain <pause dur="short"/> them cos</u>
<u n="760" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="761" who="S0152">there's so much water behind they have to put great big taps in</u>
<u n="762" who="S0012">yeah they've <unclear>got them in the Thames</unclear> and everywhere haven't they?</u>
<u n="763" who="S0152" trans="overlap">to take the water way</u>
<u n="764" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="765" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="766" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="767" who="S0152">amazing</u>
<u n="768" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="769" who="S0152"><unclear>though</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> and they they came across an an old arch</u>
<u n="770" who="S0012">they've come across a burial ground too haven't they?</u>
<u n="771" who="S0152" trans="overlap"><unclear>which could</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="772" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="773" who="S0152">which they think was the <unclear>plane</unclear></u>
<u n="774" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="775" who="S0152">but there was this arch <pause dur="short"/> somewhere <pause dur="short"/> well <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> somewhere near Canary Wharf I think <pause dur="short"/> and it was a brick arch <pause dur="short"/> er but it wasn't wide enough so they had to widen it</u>
<u n="776" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="777" who="S0152">but when they started <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> when they started to widen it <pause dur="short"/> they found <pause dur="short"/> another arch on top of it</u>
<u n="778" who="S0012">oh crikey <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="779" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="780" who="S0152">and <pause dur="short"/> we think you could just like get a Kango hammer and take it all out</u>
<u n="781" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="782" who="S0152">it took longer to get out because the way the concrete was made and the pressure that'd been put on</u>
<u n="783" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="784" who="S0152">had really made it tight and it just wouldn't just wouldn't snap</u>
<u n="785" who="S0012" trans="overlap">wouldn't budge <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="786" who="S0152" trans="overlap"><unclear>and so</unclear></u>
<u n="787" who="S0013" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="788" who="S0152">and then there was one bit that goes under the docks <pause dur="short"/> where this was <pause dur="short"/> and they literally had to drain that section of the docks</u>
<u n="789" who="S0012">did they <vocal desc="laugh"/>?</u>
<u n="790" who="S0152">so that they could put</u>
<u n="791" who="S0012"><unclear>water proof</unclear></u>
<u n="792" who="S0152">the new tunnel in <pause dur="short"/> to extend it</u>
<u n="793" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="794" who="S0152">and it's one of the big exos exhibition centres down there <pause dur="short"/> and so they after the boat show <pause dur="short"/> all the boats left they put they drained this section <pause dur="short"/> there's there's a special name for it and they had six months to do it in <pause dur="short"/> so that the next show that needed water</u>
<u n="795" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="796" who="S0152">could be used which was like a military show where</u>
<u n="797" who="S0013">wow</u>
<u n="798" who="S0152">army boats navy boats went up etcetera</u>
<u n="799" who="S0012" trans="overlap"><unclear>scary</unclear></u>
<u n="800" who="S0152">and they just did it on time <pause dur="short"/> and it was all because this bridge this arch was so strong they couldn't get it out cos they kept pulling other things</u>
<u n="801" who="S0012" trans="overlap">couldn't get it out</u>
<u n="802" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="803" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="804" who="S0013">gosh</u>
<u n="805" who="S0152">they're I mean absolutely <trunc>ama</trunc>amazing</u>
<u n="806" who="S0012" trans="overlap">when was that built <unclear>though</unclear>?</u>
<u n="807" who="S0152">eighteen something</u>
<u n="808" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="809" who="S0152">it was and it used to have <trunc>o</trunc>old <pause dur="short"/> erm horse drawn trains go down it</u>
<u n="810" who="S0012">was it down by Brunel or something like that?</u>
<u n="811" who="S0152">something like that yeah <unclear>been working on</unclear></u>
<u n="812" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah cos he was a fantastic engineer weren't he?</u>
<u n="813" who="S0152">but it was like and it's got it's got a name <pause dur="short"/> and it was just this use so they've used some of that <pause dur="short"/> but they showed you boring into erm <pause dur="short"/> liverpool Street station</u>
<u n="814" who="S0012">yeah?</u>
<u n="815" who="S0152">erm <pause dur="short"/> well they broke into there and they also broke into Canary Wharf <pause dur="short"/> station and the how they've built Canary Wharf <pause dur="short"/> station they built it in different platforms and you gotta all the ventilation into account</u>
<u n="816" who="S0012">yeah you have yeah</u>
<u n="817" who="S0152">all the escalators where they go</u>

<u n="821" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="822" who="S0152">amazing <pause dur="short"/> piece of engineering <pause dur="short"/> and they're like a millimetre out <pause dur="short"/> after they'd gone all that way and you're thinking <vocal desc="gasp"/></u>
<u n="823" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that was like the Channel Tunnel</u>

<u n="827" who="S0012">millimetres out</u>
<u n="828" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="829" who="S0012">when they dug <pause dur="short"/> when they met each other</u>
<u n="830" who="S0152" trans="overlap">amazing <pause dur="short"/> amazing</u>
<u n="831" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="832" who="S0152">and it's just so many people working on it</u>

<u n="834" who="S0152">you know so many people working on the whole line</u>
<u n="835" who="S0012">fantastic innit I mean when you think about the work and the and the brains that go into it all</u>
<u n="836" who="S0152">you know and there's a guy who this is gonna be his last tunnel <pause dur="short"/> but he's worked <pause dur="short"/> doing tunnels for the last something like fifty odd years sixty odd years</u>
<u n="837" who="S0012">wow</u>
<u n="838" who="S0013">yes</u>
<u n="839" who="S0152">and his sons are into it as well</u>

<u n="841" who="S0152">and he's <pause dur="short"/> he's the <trunc>m</trunc> what the last one that he built like the Jubilee line and</u>
<u n="842" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="843" who="S0152">helped build that and a couple of other</u>
<u n="844" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="845" who="S0152">so but he's it's the biggest engineering project in Europe</u>
<u n="846" who="S0012">is it?</u>
<u n="847" who="S0013">is it?</u>
<u n="848" who="S0152">at the moment</u>

<u n="850" who="S0013" trans="overlap"><unclear>yeah</unclear></u>
<u n="851" who="S0152">now you these machines that come from Germany are just amazing</u>
<u n="852" who="S0012">but when you see</u>
<u n="853" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="854" who="S0012">the the underground system as it is <pause dur="short"/> it's packed now people everywhere</u>

<u n="864" who="S0152">absolutely amazing</u>
<u n="865" who="S0012">and and er <vocal desc="laugh"/> they did a little thing on there the other day about the underground system <trunc>th</trunc> and and the passengers <pause dur="short"/> and in rush hour people literally fight to get on <pause dur="short"/> because there's just not enough room and then they're standing there like that once they're in</u>
<u n="866" who="S0152">yeah</u>

<u n="876" who="S0152">you just can't get about <pause dur="short"/> erm I was in the building society this morning and er <pause dur="short"/> the guy behind the <pause dur="short"/> counter said oh you got much planned for today and I went <pause dur="short"/> not not really not until later when I'm back to being chauffeur again and he looked and I went I've <trunc>w</trunc> done one lot of taxiing this morning and I've gotta go and do something else and he <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="877" who="S0012" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="878" who="S0152">er kind of explained about the girls he says <pause dur="short"/> he says transport in this area he says it's awful isn't it?</u>
<u n="879" who="S0012">it is yeah</u>
<u n="880" who="S0152">so he says I came from the other side of London <pause dur="short"/> and you can get a bus at any time of the day</u>
<u n="881" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="882" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="883" who="S0152">there's always one or two that you could catch</u>

<u n="890" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="891" who="S0152">you know I said well I said my daughter I said if I she has to be at work for nine o'clock <pause dur="short"/> it means that she has to leave <pause dur="short"/> she has to catch the like ten to eight bus <pause dur="short"/> there isn't a ten to eight bus to get there for nine o'clock</u>

<u n="909" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="910" who="S0152">you could get a bus at <anon type="place"/> into <anon type="place"/> to <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> every fifteen minutes</u>

<u n="929" who="S0012">oh I thought it was</u>
<u n="930" who="S0013" trans="overlap">that's more than</u>
<u n="931" who="S0012">I thought it was between five and six</u>

<u n="933" who="S0152">that's the last one back</u>
<u n="934" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="935" who="S0012">that'd be packed wouldn't it?</u>

<u n="938" who="S0152">no <pause dur="short"/> I mean <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> has caught that <trunc>la</trunc> that one bus at that time and I've had to pick her up at <anon type="place"/> pick her up at <anon type="place"/> rather than going to <anon type="place"/> to pick her up</u>
<u n="939" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> don't it stop in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="940" who="S0152">no <unclear><anon type="place"/></unclear></u>
<u n="941" who="S0012" trans="overlap">it goes straight along the road</u>

<u n="943" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="944" who="S0152">so the <anon type="place"/> the express bus stops at <anon type="place"/> so it does the villages <pause dur="short"/> just pick it up she lets me know where she is and I just go and <unclear>pick her up</unclear></u>
<u n="945" who="S0012" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> so when's the last bus in <anon type="place"/> to <anon type="place"/> then? I don't think there is one er</u>
<u n="946" who="S0152" trans="overlap">I think half seven I think</u>
<u n="947" who="S0012" trans="overlap">back <pause dur="short"/> that's what I thought that was early one</u>
<u n="948" who="S0152">half seven I think yeah</u>
<u n="949" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="950" who="S0152">so <pause dur="short"/> but you know you kind of think well <pause dur="short"/> you counteract your not so profitable bus route with the ones that are profitable</u>
<u n="951" who="S0012">yeah</u>
