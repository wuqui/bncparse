<u n="183" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0024">robotic <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="185" who="S0144">that's that's a good story that is</u>
<u n="186" who="S0024">and then  and then  you just train them to do repetitive actions or to do</u>
<u n="187" who="S0144">yeah but there's no uniformity in it is there <pause dur="short"/> I mean it could be anything <pause dur="short"/> whether you're counting leaves on a plant or</u>
<u n="188" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0144">or checking the door's locked ten times <pause dur="short"/> you've got no way of making the obsession</u>

<u n="191" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's strange <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="192" who="S0024">like people can't sleep or can't rest until they know that they've locked the door a hundred times or tested the door handle seven times</u>
<u n="193" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="194" who="S0024">turned around three times and <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="195" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> you're like that with some doors aren't you <pause dur="short"/> we leave the house and I say have you locked the door? You have to go back <pause dur="short"/> yeah just</u>
<u n="196" who="S0024" trans="overlap"><unclear/> with locking <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah I'll probably check that and back <pause dur="short"/> but I've got no particular number <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't like go back and check it three times</u>
<u n="197" who="S0144">oh yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0024">I'd go back and check it maybe twice one day <pause dur="short"/> maybe seven times the next day</u>
<u n="199" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="200" who="S0024"><unclear/> And the gas <pause dur="short"/> I do check <pause dur="short"/> but I that's a check check check <pause dur="short"/> but that's not specific</u>
<u n="201" who="S0144">yeah but you don't trust yourself enough in your head to go yeah I did that</u>
<u n="202" who="S0024">mhm</u>
<u n="203" who="S0144">and you have to go and check it</u>
<u n="204" who="S0024">no <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but that's different</u>
<u n="205" who="S0144">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> cos that's what leads to you checking it twice and then having a a safety number so you check it like three times</u>
<u n="206" who="S0024">but the reason I check it again is because I don't remember checking it in the first place</u>
<u n="207" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="208" who="S0024">so if I don't remember checking it how am I going suppose to remember to count the three times <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>c</trunc> I wouldn't be able to do that <pause dur="short"/> I'll be I'll check <pause dur="short"/> cos I check it</u>
<u n="209" who="S0144">yeah but that <unclear/></u>
<u n="210" who="S0024">but then I walk away and I did I do it? Didn't I do? Did I do it? Didn't I do it? I'll go back and do it</u>
<u n="211" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah that's why they have the ritual of like you do everything like three times</u>
<u n="212" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="213" who="S0144">so you know you're going to do it three times <pause dur="short"/> so when you leave you know you've done it three times</u>
<u n="214" who="S0024">okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> I see that</u>
<u n="215" who="S0144" trans="overlap">but then  but then  it gets to the point where you do it three times but you didn't do it right because your hand wasn't in the right position or something so you have to go and do it another three times and then  and then  someone made a noise while you were doing it so that one doesn't count <pause dur="short"/> so you've got to do it again</u>
<u n="216" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="217" who="S0144">it just becomes insanity</u>
<u n="218" who="S0024">yeah but it can happen to anybody</u>
<u n="219" who="S0144">oh yeah</u>
<u n="220" who="S0024">I don't think there's a genetic <trunc>dis</trunc> disposition <pause dur="short"/> I think there's</u>
<u n="221" who="S0144" trans="overlap">it can <pause dur="short"/> no there must be something</u>
<u n="222" who="S0024">no <pause dur="short"/> I think it can happen to absolutely anybody under the right circumstances</u>
<u n="223" who="S0144" trans="overlap">oh I do as well <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="224" who="S0024">they've got a new name for erm the mixture of genetics and environment <pause dur="short"/> I've forgotten <pause dur="short"/> oh I've forgotten the name of it</u>
<u n="225" who="S0144">A mixture of nature and nurture?</u>
<u n="226" who="S0024">yeah they've <pause dur="short"/> there's a new theory which balances it up <pause dur="short"/> it's probably not new <pause dur="short"/> it's not a new theory but they've given a name to it <pause dur="short"/> oh what is it? Anyway I don't think it's anything <trunc>t</trunc> with genetics that particular action <pause dur="short"/> I think that's pure environment <pause dur="short"/> I think it can happen to anyone</u>
<u n="227" who="S0144" trans="overlap">do you? I don't</u>
<u n="228" who="S0024">no</u>
<u n="229" who="S0144">I think there's definitely a gene which some people are more</u>
<u n="230" who="S0024">prone to it</u>
<u n="231" who="S0144">prone to it <pause dur="short"/> but I agree everyone's got it</u>
<u n="232" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mhm <pause dur="short"/> I think it's</u>
<u n="233" who="S0144">so everyone's but it's like anything isn't it</u>
<u n="234" who="S0024">everybody <trunc>go</trunc> got it to some sort of degree</u>
<u n="235" who="S0144">everything's on a sliding scale</u>
<u n="236" who="S0024">so surely you can make that worse or make it better depending on your environment</u>
<u n="237" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="238" who="S0024">no <pause dur="short"/> I think <pause dur="short"/> I don't think it's genetic at all</u>
<u n="239" who="S0144">you don't think it's genetic at all <pause dur="short"/> but you said it's on a sliding scale which means it's genetic</u>
<u n="240" who="S0024">yeah everybody's got it genetically <pause dur="short"/> but it's not  it's not  like right you're going to have OCD because it's in your genes <pause dur="short"/> I don't believe that I think it's all to do with the environment</u>
<u n="241" who="S0144" trans="overlap">oh no it needs a trigger</u>
<u n="242" who="S0024">and and how</u>
<u n="243" who="S0144">A social trigger</u>
<u n="244" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="245" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="246" who="S0024">and how you've practised and rituals that you've developed and rituals you've copied and the routines that you're <pause dur="short"/> like that</u>
<u n="247" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah when er <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="248" who="S0024">so I think if if I put myself in a weird situation where I start checking the door three times or I start counting erm things in this room every time I come in this room then I can develop a weird problem</u>
<u n="249" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="250" who="S0024">through habit <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> I want to go and see spotty <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="251" who="S0144">go in there a minute then</u>
<u n="252" who="S0024"><pause dur="long"/> Oh she <trunc>d</trunc> she just looks a bit worn out really <pause dur="short"/> she doesn't look</u>
<u n="253" who="S0144">well she wasn't well when we were down there</u>
<u n="254" who="S0024">no God <pause dur="short"/> she had that cold and</u>
<u n="255" who="S0144">well kids do though don't they</u>
<u n="256" who="S0024" trans="overlap">at least she keeps herself busy <pause dur="short"/> she keeps herself busy <pause dur="short"/> works through it</u>
<u n="257" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="258" who="S0024">that's another weird ritual people have like if they get sick you get those people that if they get a little bit sick then their treatment is lie down and recover and don't do a thing until they're better</u>
<u n="259" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="260" who="S0024">or you get the people that work through it and work work work</u>
<u n="261" who="S0144">that's not a ritual that's</u>
<u n="262" who="S0024">that is <pause dur="short"/> that's from when you're a little kid and you're your mum and dad let you continue to play <pause dur="short"/> continue to go outside <pause dur="short"/> or they tuck you up in bed and say sleep darling sleep</u>
<u n="263" who="S0144">that's just what you've been taught</u>
<u n="264" who="S0024">well that's exactly</u>
<u n="265" who="S0144">that's not a ritual</u>
<u n="266" who="S0024">but then when you're older that becomes part of you of how you get better</u>
<u n="267" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="268" who="S0024">and that's all that you know</u>
<u n="269" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="270" who="S0024">so I think it's all a similar thing of how you've developed your behaviour</u>
<u n="271" who="S0144" trans="overlap">like cultural reality isn't it</u>
<u n="272" who="S0024">it's just you develop your behaviours and it's difficult to change when you're older</u>
<u n="273" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="274" who="S0024">and it just and <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what I'm talking about</u>
<u n="275" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah but it's only possible to develop that behaviour because it you've got some genetic makeup for it <pause dur="short"/> to build it upon</u>
<u n="276" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah but everybody's got it</u>
<u n="277" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="278" who="S0024">so it's not a predisposition to be</u>
<u n="279" who="S0144" trans="overlap">no so you <trunc>s</trunc> so it is a mixture of both</u>
<u n="280" who="S0024">it is but there's not a predisposition <pause dur="short"/> this person's going to become OCD when they're older <pause dur="short"/> like if you looked at all of their genes <pause dur="short"/> ah and they found the gene for it <pause dur="short"/> they they would <trunc>neve</trunc> like Down's or something like that or some other disease</u>
<u n="281" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah but <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="282" who="S0024">you where where they can look at the genes and say I'm afraid you're gonna unfortunately have this problem</u>
<u n="283" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="284" who="S0024">that kind of psychological problem <pause dur="short"/> they'll never be able to tell <pause dur="short"/> they could tell maybe they've got a <pause dur="short"/> oh I don't know</u>
<u n="285" who="S0144">well it's the same with alcoholism isn't it</u>
<u n="286" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="287" who="S0144">they they say that that's genetic</u>
<u n="288" who="S0024">no no no</u>
<u n="289" who="S0144">but I don't</u>
<u n="290" who="S0024">I don't think it is</u>
<u n="291" who="S0144">I don't think it is either <pause dur="short"/> I think everyone's got that gene to have it become a problem but I think it's a product of your social environment</u>
<u n="292" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah that's what I think too <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="293" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="294" who="S0024">because you can see how everybody has got a little bit of something</u>
<u n="295" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="296" who="S0024">everybody's weirdos <pause dur="short"/> everybody's a weirdo</u>
<u n="297" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="298" who="S0024">it's just how</u>
<u n="299" who="S0144">mm <pause dur="short"/> she needs a certain amount of <trunc>li</trunc> <trunc>li</trunc> life I don't know type of event <pause dur="short"/> like a traumatic experience or a very stressful situation <pause dur="short"/> when like you've got these tolerances haven't you and these things that you build these walls to stop this stuff getting in</u>
<u n="300" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="301" who="S0144">but if you go through a traumatic experience these walls get broken down and make you more vulnerable for things like this to get in</u>
<u n="302" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="303" who="S0144">and then because a lot of the time they they become manifested in after a big event or a</u>
<u n="304" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I yeah mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah I think that can happen but also they can be manifested through boredom</u>
<u n="305" who="S0144" trans="overlap">do you not think? Boredom <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="306" who="S0024">through not knowing what to do with your time <pause dur="short"/> through mismanagement of your time or something</u>
<u n="307" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="308" who="S0024">you know <pause dur="short"/> not necessarily a big event <pause dur="short"/> I think it could be a gradual process of what shall I do today?</u>
<u n="309" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> well that's depression isn't it</u>
<u n="310" who="S0024">well yeah yeah depression then okay <pause dur="short"/> not boredom <pause dur="short"/> depression</u>
<u n="311" who="S0144">mm which is</u>
<u n="312" who="S0024" trans="overlap">lying in bed counting the things on your ceiling or something</u>
<u n="313" who="S0144">Cos you've got nothing else to do</u>
<u n="314" who="S0024">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="315" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah you need to keep active and doing stuff don't you</u>
<u n="316" who="S0024">and then it just becomes a habit and it becomes a life</u>
<u n="317" who="S0144" trans="overlap">and that  and that  basically is everything isn't it</u>
<u n="318" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="319" who="S0144">each need to keep active <pause dur="short"/> keep yourself interested in doing stuff</u>
<u n="320" who="S0024">yeah I think so</u>
<u n="321" who="S0144">and it will keep a hell of a lot of problems at bay just by doing that <pause dur="short"/> cos everything stems from you getting a little bit depressed or anything like that</u>
<u n="322" who="S0024" trans="overlap">when you sit I mean I <pause dur="short"/> everybody's been through like oh oh I can't be bothered to do anything today oh oh <pause dur="short"/> I'll just go and sit somewhere</u>
<u n="323" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="324" who="S0024">or sit and even play a stupid computer game or do something that takes your mind off things but in doing that you're taking your mind off your problems but then you're doing something stupid like counting or</u>
<u n="325" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah like getting a box set of a TV show or something and just sitting down and watch it all</u>
<u n="326" who="S0024">that's where Facebook is actually quite a good thing because if that becomes like a somebody's habit for you know they're actually still communicating with people <pause dur="short"/> they're not sitting in a room</u>
<u n="327" who="S0144">can you count that as communication?</u>
<u n="328" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="short"/> I suppose not <pause dur="short"/> no but I mean it's better than sitting there with a little tiny Game Boy playing a game or on your telephone playing the game on your telephone or something like that</u>
<u n="329" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah well <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> I suppose it does count as communication because you are getting a response to a certain extent</u>
<u n="330" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I know it's isolated <pause dur="short"/> it's isolated communication</u>
<u n="331" who="S0144">it's impersonal</u>
<u n="332" who="S0024">but some people <trunc>tre</trunc> you know some people have chats with their friends on it all of the time and</u>
<u n="333" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="334" who="S0024">and then <pause dur="short"/> it depends how you use it</u>
<u n="335" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I don't know it's completely different isn't it</u>
<u n="336" who="S0024">but that as a distraction for your life</u>
<u n="337" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="338" who="S0024">isn't so bad compared to I don't know sitting in a room staring into space</u>
<u n="339" who="S0144">but it is a distraction for life which is bad</u>
<u n="340" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I suppose so <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I better go and say goodbye <pause dur="long"/> That Skype <pause dur="short"/> she has such problems with that Skype it's just freezes</u>
<u n="341" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="342" who="S0024">and I think she can hear everything that we say but then we end up staring at the screen going oh I can't hear them <pause dur="short"/> mm can't hear them but she can hear the other side</u>
