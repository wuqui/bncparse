<u n="16" who="S0262" trans="overlap">crikey</u>
<u n="17" who="S0303">and everything's being controlled by somebody or other but it's all very vague</u>
<u n="18" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="19" who="S0303">and I don't know whether it's because he takes drugs now he doesn't admit that he does whether it's because he's taken a lot of drugs in the past</u>
<u n="20" who="S0262">right</u>

<u n="321" who="S0303" trans="overlap">I don't do MPs I've heard I've heard of an MP3</u>
<u n="322" who="S0262">there's a couple of clicks and buttons <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> showed me how to do it it's fine</u>
<u n="323" who="S0303">is it like a tape basically?</u>
<u n="324" who="S0262">it well yes it is it's just</u>
<u n="325" who="S0303" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="326" who="S0262">that's their format that they want so this would doesn't</u>
<u n="327" who="S0303" trans="overlap">is it is an MP3 is a tangible thing or it's</u>
<u n="328" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it's like an iTunes you know that's what I was gonna say it is tangible</u>
<u n="329" who="S0303" trans="overlap">can you can you touch it? okay it's not a concept it's</u>
<u n="330" who="S0262">I it's a touch it as it click it through the</u>
<u n="331" who="S0303" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="332" who="S0262">it's a digital touch as in you click on there</u>
<u n="333" who="S0303">okay</u>
<u n="334" who="S0262">on on the file</u>
<u n="335" who="S0303" trans="overlap">ah so a file</u>
<u n="336" who="S0262" trans="overlap">like a Word document or</u>
<u n="337" who="S0303">okay</u>
<u n="338" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it's just a document</u>
<u n="339" who="S0303" trans="overlap">so it's yeah</u>
<u n="340" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah so it's just a file and so I know how to do that so that's two clicks <pause dur="short"/> and then what I have to do is I have to go over the conversation so you were right in that respect when I when I emailed you about it and said oh I'm really not sure if I really want to <trunc>ha</trunc> hate the you know the sound of my own voice</u>
<u n="341" who="S0303"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="343" who="S0303" trans="overlap">should be quite interesting</u>
<u n="344" who="S0262">yeah it is it is actually really interesting on some of the conversations because what's happened is that they somehow cos I've got an Apple Mac and I don't' know how it works but somehow these MP3 files are recognised by Itunes because Itunes only use MP3 files for audio <pause dur="short"/> anyway to cut a long story short</u>
<u n="345" who="S0303" trans="overlap">I'm sorry about on ITunes is I've heard of all these things</u>

<u n="353" who="S0303" trans="overlap">I don't know what it is I've just heard</u>
<u n="354" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="355" who="S0303" trans="overlap">of ITunes</u>
<u n="356" who="S0262">so my little thing that I put on</u>

<u n="358" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="359" who="S0303">terms but</u>
<u n="360" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and and they are just files and and so because they're <trunc>i</trunc> they're in my Itunes now I didn't put them there they're in there they are</u>
<u n="361" who="S0303" trans="overlap">they just went there on their own?</u>
<u n="362" who="S0262">yeah and then when I do my auto sync for my little MP3 player which is this tiny little one that you know when I'm</u>
<u n="363" who="S0303" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="364" who="S0262">walking around and <trunc>s</trunc></u>

<u n="367" who="S0303">yeah</u>
<u n="368" who="S0262">and then I I I switch it on and there's a bit of music and then there's something and then all of a sudden it's one of these recordings so it's one of the conversations</u>
<u n="369" who="S0303" trans="overlap">oh that's quite funny</u>
<u n="370" who="S0262">so this <trunc>morn</trunc> erm this afternoon for a whole hour and a half</u>
<u n="371" who="S0303" trans="overlap">but you'll start to see people in a whole new light</u>
<u n="372" who="S0262">well I re-listened</u>

<u n="376" who="S0262">yeah you don't realise</u>
<u n="377" who="S0303" trans="overlap">it's very different</u>
<u n="378" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="379" who="S0303">from afterwards because I think <pause dur="short"/> people think that they gravitate towards some people and don't gravitate towards others because of the content of what the person says</u>
<u n="380" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="381" who="S0303">but it's not that</u>
<u n="382" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="383" who="S0303">at all it's to do with the way the person is</u>
<u n="384" who="S0262">exactly</u>
<u n="385" who="S0303">I know people who I think they're quite cognitively challenged</u>
<u n="386" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="387" who="S0303">and the types of things they talk about are not of any actual interest to me</u>
<u n="388" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="389" who="S0303">but I love their company</u>
<u n="390" who="S0262" trans="overlap">the way they're saying it yeah</u>

<u n="396" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="397" who="S0303">they're just so nice and yet and there are other people who I think <pause dur="short"/> on paper</u>
<u n="398" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="399" who="S0303">we've got a lot in common we've got a similar interest</u>
<u n="400" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="401" who="S0303">we're probably a similar level of education</u>
<u n="402" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="403" who="S0303">IQ</u>
<u n="404" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="405" who="S0303">erm ideology and yet they're just unbearable</u>
<u n="406" who="S0262">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="407" who="S0303" trans="overlap">probably because they're like me but I mean I just I wouldn't wanna be around them too much</u>
<u n="408" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="409" who="S0303">and that's why I never understand how this erm <pause dur="short"/> computer version of the lonely hearts column works</u>
<u n="410" who="S0262">oh I don't know anything about that</u>
<u n="411" who="S0303" trans="overlap">because let's say if like people I know people who've done it like</u>
<u n="412" who="S0262" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="413" who="S0303"><trunc>s</trunc> I don't know it's basically</u>
<u n="414" who="S0262" trans="overlap">what what is it?</u>
<u n="415" who="S0303" trans="overlap">a way of finding a</u>

<u n="417" who="S0303" trans="overlap">boyfriend</u>
<u n="418" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="419" who="S0303">but via</u>
<u n="420" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it's like a matchmaking</u>
<u n="421" who="S0303" trans="overlap">the computer yeah <pause dur="short"/> but if you just typed in exactly what you thought your ideal person was</u>
<u n="422" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0303">er and then you also tapped in what your idea of an absolute nightmare would be</u>
<u n="424" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="425" who="S0303">the chances are you're gonna prefer <pause dur="short"/> the second person</u>
<u n="426" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="427" who="S0303">because it's nothing to do with you know just because somebody likes reading and likes going to the cinema and likes learning languages</u>
<u n="428" who="S0262" trans="overlap">doesn't mean you're going to like the same types of books or anything</u>
<u n="429" who="S0303" trans="overlap">no it's just</u>
<u n="430" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="431" who="S0303">but it's</u>
<u n="432" who="S0262" trans="overlap">the whole approach might be completely different</u>
<u n="433" who="S0303">yeah</u>
<u n="434" who="S0262">yeah yeah I know what you mean <pause dur="short"/> that's interesting</u>
<u n="435" who="S0303">it's nothing to do with anything you can put your finger on just some people you take to</u>
<u n="436" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="437" who="S0303" trans="overlap">and some people you don't</u>
<u n="438" who="S0262">yeah I hadn't thought about it like that before but even so just er this afternoon I got on the train and I was listening to a bit of music and then all of a sudden the conversation from erm the time when I met er my mum's half-sister came on</u>
<u n="439" who="S0303" trans="overlap">I really wanna hear about that</u>

<u n="877" who="S0303">yeah</u>

<u n="882" who="S0262" trans="overlap">one after the other</u>

<u n="894" who="S0262" trans="overlap">teachers whatever so she had to say no because technically she had never met my mum so she said no and she didn't want to open up a can of worms to say yes but she did know at that point</u>
<u n="895" who="S0303">so that story sounds potentially plausible</u>
<u n="896" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="897" who="S0303">but the thing is you just never know</u>
<u n="898" who="S0262">no</u>

<u n="922" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's exactly yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="923" who="S0303">cos that story almost it does sound plausible but</u>
<u n="924" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="925" who="S0303">but it sounds almost a bit too pat doesn't it?</u>
<u n="926" who="S0262">yes</u>
<u n="927" who="S0303">it sounds almost as if</u>
<u n="928" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="929" who="S0303">if you were making up a story to illustrate what you wanted to convey</u>
<u n="930" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="931" who="S0303">that's the story you'd come up with</u>
<u n="932" who="S0262">yeah yes it could be</u>
<u n="933" who="S0303">it's not natural</u>
<u n="934" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it isn't quite obvious</u>

<u n="940" who="S0262">yeah yeah there is something about it but and then there there are so many cross links you know I mean she went back way back to the eighteen forty-one census but what I find fascinating I quite like these quirky things is that she said that she'd found and and the that census in eighteen forty-one that there was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> living in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="941" who="S0303">oh</u>
<u n="942" who="S0262" trans="overlap">now my granny would have been <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> cos she married a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and she kept her married name and granny moved to <anon type="place"/> in the nineteen sixties</u>
<u n="943" who="S0303">cos I was trying to work out this is a bit of a digression</u>
<u n="944" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="973" who="S0303" trans="overlap">cos I just couldn't follow</u>
<u n="974" who="S0262">I think what happened is that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had erm advised and persuaded granny to get the hell out of <anon type="place"/> or <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="975" who="S0303">right</u>
<u n="976" who="S0262">because she was going through a divorce</u>

<u n="4235" who="S0303">yeah but it's not as if I think I'm right I think I'm wrong but</u>
<u n="4236" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no but</u>
<u n="4237" who="S0303">but I don't think it really matters</u>

<u n="4239" who="S0303">yeah</u>
<u n="4240" who="S0262">yeah I completely agree so it's really interesting now that I think that I'm in a juncture with erm you know er <pause dur="short"/> quite a difficult one I suppose erm <pause dur="short"/> but you know I it <pause dur="short"/> in a way it er I just see it as pass part of life's course erm that <pause dur="short"/> thankfully I am myself <vocal desc="laugh"/> and that I can make my own decisions</u>
<u n="4241" who="S0303">and I think probably being with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has enabled you to</u>
<u n="4242" who="S0262">yes</u>
<u n="4243" who="S0303">be yourself more</u>
<u n="4244" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah and there are other things</u>
<u n="4245" who="S0303">because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s</u>
<u n="4246" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and there are other</u>
<u n="4247" who="S0303">not the kind of person who's only gonna like you if A and he's</u>
<u n="4248" who="S0262">yes</u>
<u n="4249" who="S0303">gonna like you less if B</u>
<u n="4250" who="S0262" trans="overlap">B yeah yeah</u>
<u n="4251" who="S0303">and in a way I can imagine that could be quite annoying in some ways</u>
<u n="4252" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="4253" who="S0303">but actually overall it's very very positive</u>
<u n="4254" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="4255" who="S0303">because it gives you the space to actually finally</u>
<u n="4256" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="4257" who="S0303">be able to inhabit your own personality</u>
<u n="4258" who="S0262">yes yeah</u>
<u n="4259" who="S0303" trans="overlap">which you were never given the opportunity to do before</u>
<u n="4260" who="S0262">true very true</u>
<u n="4261" who="S0303" trans="overlap">and that's a huge thing that you can't put a price on</u>
<u n="4262" who="S0262">no god yeah yeah</u>
<u n="4263" who="S0303">and the downside of it is maybe that the person is a little bit passive at times or could be seen to be a little bit passive at times</u>
<u n="4264" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="4265" who="S0303">but the upside is precisely what I've just said you're given that space</u>
<u n="4266" who="S0262">incredible amount of space</u>
<u n="4267" who="S0303">yeah</u>
<u n="4268" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="4269" who="S0303">and if you were awarded a Nobel Prize or if you were living</u>

<u n="4271" who="S0303">homeless in a doorway I don't think</u>
<u n="4272" who="S0262" trans="overlap">even it wouldn't matter to him</u>
<u n="4273" who="S0303"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s opinion would change</u>

<u n="4275" who="S0303" trans="overlap">in the slightest</u>
<u n="4276" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="4277" who="S0303" trans="overlap">as mine wouldn't</u>
<u n="4278" who="S0262">no I think just</u>
<u n="4279" who="S0303" trans="overlap">and it's very liberating</u>
<u n="4280" who="S0262">it's just about you know our fulfilment whatever that means</u>
<u n="4281" who="S0303">yeah</u>
<u n="4282" who="S0262">to the individual</u>
<u n="4283" who="S0303">whatever</u>
<u n="4284" who="S0262">yeah which is why I think well I was going to say</u>
<u n="4285" who="S0303" trans="overlap">and who cares what other people think? I dunno I've got a kind of arrogance I don't care</u>
<u n="4286" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="4287" who="S0303" trans="overlap">what people think of me I really don't care</u>

<u n="4289" who="S0303" trans="overlap">no</u>

<u n="4293" who="S0303">objectively maybe or with a bit more perspective</u>
<u n="4294" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="4295" who="S0303">step back</u>
<u n="4296" who="S0262">yeah a <trunc>ste</trunc> a step back in erm a realisation or an awareness that there's perhaps an element of jealousy there too</u>
<u n="4297" who="S0303">oh definitely</u>
<u n="4298" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="4299" who="S0303">definitely</u>
<u n="4300" who="S0262">mm</u>

<u n="4304" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="4305" who="S0303">cos how can you be happy when you don't relate to anyone?</u>
<u n="4306" who="S0262">the only reason why I say that is because I know that</u>
<u n="4307" who="S0303" trans="overlap">I totally agree</u>

<u n="4315" who="S0303">yeah</u>

<u n="4317" who="S0303">no</u>
<u n="4318" who="S0262">and it's quite likely that it won't</u>
<u n="4319" who="S0303">no I agree</u>
<u n="4320" who="S0262">I think we're now at a juncture</u>

<u n="4322" who="S0262">where it's like okay</u>
<u n="4323" who="S0303">cos it's not as if you and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> are twelve and fourteen</u>
