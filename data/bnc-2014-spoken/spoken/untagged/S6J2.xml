<u n="28" who="S0041">I feel like he understands and I said to him about even about the <trunc>w</trunc> in the <trunc>hot</trunc> so we were in the hotel and we had a conversation very similar to this in which I kind of took responsibility for the the way that we I behaved if we were together and that I kind of panicked if something went wrong</u>
<u n="29" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0041">and I said but you never said anything back <pause dur="short"/> did you not think no wonder I panicked?</u>

<u n="32" who="S0041">I never behave like that with anybody else I've ever known</u>
<u n="33" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="34" who="S0041">well except for you because you're the only person that I felt so concerned that if something went wrong I wasn't picking just me up <pause dur="short"/> I was picking you up as well</u>
<u n="35" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0041">and now I don't need to pick you up</u>
<u n="37" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0041">and I said you <trunc>nev</trunc> you never thought thought about it at all <pause dur="short"/> you never gave anything <pause dur="short"/> you never evaluated you</u>
<u n="39" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> no it was all <pause dur="short"/> it was all you know to do about you and your faults</u>

<u n="45" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="46" who="S0041">I suppose I'll just text him like I'd text his mum</u>
<u n="47" who="S0084">well it's up to you isn't it <pause dur="short"/> I mean it <pause dur="short"/> if it were me I wouldn't as I I've said to you</u>
<u n="48" who="S0041" trans="overlap">no I'm not</u>
<u n="49" who="S0084">I've put you off the plate back in here <pause dur="short"/> for the warming</u>
<u n="50" who="S0041">the warming <pause dur="short"/> I'll probably wait to see if I hear from him on my birthday</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0041">if I don't I won't text him</u>
<u n="53" who="S0084">I'm sure he will definitely text you on your birthday <pause dur="short"/> well I would have thought so</u>
<u n="54" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> you never know with this guy <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's just I think it's easier to pretend he doesn't exist now</u>
<u n="55" who="S0084">I think this is the bit where you walk away</u>
<u n="56" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0084" trans="overlap">you've said your piece <pause dur="short"/> you've said what you wanted to say</u>
<u n="58" who="S0041" trans="overlap">I've said my bit and feel better about it and</u>
<u n="59" who="S0084">anything else that's getting said now is just going to be raking up the same issue</u>
<u n="60" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0084">it's going to hurt again and again and again</u>
<u n="62" who="S0041">quickly yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think so too <pause dur="short"/> that's that's good for me <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0041">he said er do you know you're the most amazing person I know <pause dur="short"/> he said cos no matter what happens <pause dur="short"/> no matter what you you do you always take the situation and make make yourself the best you can be out of it <pause dur="short"/> and I see you  I see you  every time becoming a better person because of things</u>
<u n="64" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0041">and I'm thinking in my head that's just what adults do <pause dur="short"/> that's what you do <pause dur="short"/> that's a natural reaction</u>
<u n="66" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0041">erm and  he said I read  he said I read a an article today er it was a design thing <pause dur="short"/> erm and it was basically about <trunc>get</trunc> <event desc="sound of bang"/> getting rid of a sorry <pause dur="short"/> getting rid of everybody needs to get rid of things in their life that are surplus to requirement</u>
<u n="68" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="69" who="S0041">you know that you're not <pause dur="short"/> that don't help you <pause dur="short"/> that actually hinder you <pause dur="short"/> and he said I've realised I've become one of those people for you</u>
<u n="70" who="S0084">A bit fucking melodramatic isn't it</u>
<u n="71" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0084">erm well I mean it that whole self <trunc>loa</trunc> that's that's the same thing isn't it <pause dur="short"/> the self loathing that oh I can't do anything about it it's changed my personality <pause dur="short"/> bollocks</u>
<u n="73" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0084">it's just that <pause dur="short"/> you know it's it's like he's not taking responsibility he's just saying woe is me <pause dur="short"/> I'm such a bad <pause dur="short"/> you know I'm such a bad friend <pause dur="short"/> oh dear oh dear <pause dur="short"/> he never does anything about it because this is hardly the first time you've said you're letting me down <pause dur="short"/> can you man up?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0084">I mean how many times have you had this conversation? You know I mean I appreciate today it's probably a bit more sever than he's used to</u>
<u n="77" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0084">but London was pretty bad</u>
<u n="79" who="S0041">yeah that was pretty bad</u>
<u n="80" who="S0084">and the time before that when he you know you were saying <unclear/> here</u>
<u n="81" who="S0041" trans="overlap">it's like he can't gauge severity</u>
<u n="82" who="S0084">it's like I mean he he gets upset every time you have this conversation <pause dur="short"/> and even if that's his gauge for how serious a conversation is he can see that you're hurting which then upsets him <pause dur="short"/> fine <pause dur="short"/> so you know it's not malicious <pause dur="short"/> he just isn't doing anything to change it</u>
<u n="83" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I was I remember you know if we used to argue he <trunc>kin</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> it's as if he didn't quite grasp how angry I was</u>
<u n="84" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0041">and I I once screamed at him so bad <pause dur="short"/> I threw him out of the car <pause dur="short"/> I've never been that angry with anyone <pause dur="short"/> but it's like he couldn't <pause dur="short"/> it's like he didn't quite get how how bad it was</u>
<u n="86" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0041">and that's I think that's a bit of an autistic thing</u>
<u n="88" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0041">like the way he walked in here today as if he knew it was wrong but he didn't know how wrong <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> to me</u>
<u n="90" who="S0084" trans="overlap">he didn't know what was wrong <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0084">even though when you left things in London you said <unclear/> is it you want? If you want to be friends man up</u>
<u n="93" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0084">and he just hasn't done that</u>
<u n="95" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="96" who="S0084">Cos obviously he wasn't here last week <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="97" who="S0041">I'm a bit scared about the flipping</u>
<u n="98" who="S0084">I'm feeling very confident for you</u>
<u n="99" who="S0041">what about if the olive goes everywhere though?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0084">I'd do it over the hob and then at least it can be saved as opposed to over the floor</u>
<event desc="sound of pancake flipping"/>
<u n="101" who="S0084">wooh <pause dur="short"/> you didn't end up with a pancake hats though</u>
<u n="102" who="S0041">oh <pause dur="short"/> oh no <pause dur="short"/> oh no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> open up <pause dur="short"/> it clearly wasn't ready for flipping <pause dur="short"/> wasn't quite  wasn't quite  cooked yet <pause dur="short"/> just burn you up on there now</u>
<u n="103" who="S0084">Cook cook cook</u>
<u n="104" who="S0041">I'm just feeling like I'm draining my resources are just gone</u>
<u n="105" who="S0084">well as hard as it is at least you know you've made the right decision</u>
<u n="106" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> he's probably never going to man up in his whole whole life</u>
<u n="107" who="S0084">probably not in the short term <pause dur="short"/> not in the time that you needed to because he would have done by now</u>
<u n="108" who="S0041" trans="overlap">uh uh</u>
<u n="109" who="S0084">I know maybe it's you know it's asking quite a lot from him <pause dur="short"/> maybe he just needs the time <pause dur="short"/> you know normally it's when you're single that you really sort of have that self reflection and he's not really done that because he's just launched himself straight into something</u>
<u n="110" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0084">that looked to be fairly easy going but has quickly become quite serious <pause dur="short"/> you know planning all your weekends together <pause dur="short"/> you know booking a holiday with each other when you've only had like three dates</u>
<u n="112" who="S0041" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0084">do you reckon that's probably another sign of him not being able to gauge what's acceptable because you wouldn't book a holiday with somebody you've only seen three times</u>
<u n="114" who="S0041" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no you wouldn't</u>
<u n="115" who="S0084"><unclear/> mental issues of the brain</u>
<u n="116" who="S0041">mental issues of the brain yo <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> don't really know when you know these are cooked</u>
<u n="117" who="S0084">is that cooked?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0041">Don't know</u>
<u n="119" who="S0084">aren't they supposed to be more brown than that?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0041">I think so yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0084">does it need to be flipped again?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0041">do you think?</u>
<u n="123" who="S0084">it's an <trunc>a</trunc> it's an alien <pause dur="short"/> aliens coming out</u>
<u n="124" who="S0041">oh I'm a bit scared of the flipping <event desc="sound of pancake flipping"/></u>
<u n="125" who="S0084">wooh <pause dur="short"/> there you go</u>
<u n="126" who="S0041">that's cooked on that side now isn't it?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> apart form the alien growth on the middle <pause dur="short"/> that's fine <pause dur="short"/> that looks delicious <pause dur="short"/> delicious and nutritious <unclear/> again</u>
<u n="128" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="129" who="S0084">hmm <pause dur="short"/> I went around to my mum's today at lunch <pause dur="short"/> it was really nice actually because I had the car and I my head was hurting quite a lot this morning so I just thought oh fuck it I'll taka a <trunc>long</trunc> longer lunch <pause dur="short"/> I worked through my lunch yesterday</u>
<u n="130" who="S0041" trans="overlap">argh</u>
<u n="131" who="S0084">and I drove over there <pause dur="short"/> it was quite nice <pause dur="short"/> my sister was off work as well <pause dur="short"/> she had the day off so they were there and <unclear/></u>

<u n="133" who="S0084">my sister made me  a cheesie  a cheesie toastie <pause dur="short"/> it was nice <pause dur="short"/> we were talking about life and the universe which was a bit full on for a lunch time</u>
<u n="134" who="S0041">seems to be a bit of full on Wednesday <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="135" who="S0084">yeah it's all a bit serious <pause dur="short"/> no wonder my heads about to fall out my <trunc>he</trunc> my ears</u>
<u n="136" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="137" who="S0084">no wonder</u>
<u n="138" who="S0041">is your sister still set on er a foreign life?</u>
<u n="139" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well the course that she want really really really wanted to do which she didn't have to think about too much is the one in Berlin <pause dur="short"/> and you can't apply for that until April <pause dur="short"/> six months before you'd be due to start</u>
<u n="140" who="S0041">well it's</u>
<u n="141" who="S0084">yo <pause dur="short"/> I think she's applied for the one in Stockholm <pause dur="short"/> she's just waiting to hear and just as a sort of backup <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's all going okay</u>
<u n="142" who="S0041">you don't get to hear from six till six months before you're due to start?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0084">you can't apply until six months before</u>
<u n="144" who="S0041">really?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0084">pass <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what's going on there</u>
<u n="146" who="S0041">that's a bit extreme isn't it</u>
<u n="147" who="S0084" trans="overlap"><unclear/> Are your things on fire?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0041">only a little bit of black on the bottom</u>
<u n="149" who="S0084">I'm fine <pause dur="long"/> <unclear/> I might need to try and leave work early tomorrow <pause dur="short"/> I might work <unclear/> and ask why <pause dur="short"/> big boss <pause dur="short"/> as I have no boss <pause dur="short"/> whether I can leave a two-thirty and go and look at charity for burlesque costumes</u>
<u n="150" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="151" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said she was looking at corsets online last night but I mean I could have told her that they're really expensive</u>
<u n="152" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm and you can't get one this quickly now</u>
<u n="153" who="S0084" trans="overlap">seventy <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> so we're thinking some sort of erm netting possibly with some sort of top <pause dur="short"/> I'm thinking charity or vintage shops <pause dur="short"/> for instance sort of feathers you know big feathers</u>
<u n="154" who="S0041" trans="overlap">yes feathers</u>
<u n="155" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0041" trans="overlap">Peacock feathers <pause dur="short"/> peacock feathers</u>
<u n="157" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> peacock feathers <pause dur="short"/> I'm thinking of going all in black possibly <pause dur="short"/> you know maybe even some full length gloves if I can find them <pause dur="short"/> cos even if I found them on Amazon or something you can get next day delivery so</u>
<u n="158" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="159" who="S0084">I'm feeling quite confident about that <pause dur="short"/> laura the girl whose birthday it is <pause dur="short"/> she sent a message around to just the girls saying I think it would be quite nice having a few drinks before hand <pause dur="short"/> but erm I'm aware that we won't be wearing many clothes so if you don't want to go into town just let me know and I'll organise drinks at my house <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> house <pause dur="short"/> cos we will be naked <pause dur="short"/> I spoke to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and said <pause dur="short"/> cos she hadn't spoken to me since <unclear/> and said I'm not coming out for your birthday</u>
<u n="160" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0084">oh you have met her from <trunc>womb</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> oh you know Womble from New Years Eve?</u>
<u n="162" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0084">I think the birthday turned out to be some sort of double date so I'm quite glad that I didn't go</u>
<u n="164" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="165" who="S0084">Cos basically <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <unclear/> and Womble and his new girlfriend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> it was the four of them <pause dur="short"/> so I'm quite glad that I didn't just rock up at like ten O'clock for one drink and then all the couples went home to shag because that would have been really depressing</u>
<u n="166" who="S0041" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0084">Cos I think that strange little DJ was supposed to go but I don't think he did <pause dur="short"/> so anyway I was feeling a bit guilty and I meant to text her myself but she beat me to eat <pause dur="short"/> apparently she's booking the flights for Australia on Saturday morning so I said I'll meet you in town at one which gives me time to make the Guinness cake in the morning <pause dur="short"/> I'm hoping I'll be able to add to it tomorrow afternoon or at least gather an idea for something because I don't want to just try and find something on Saturday and like it would be a real panic</u>
