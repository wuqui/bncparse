<u n="1" who="S0508">it on? <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> well I was born in England <pause dur="short"/> in a little country market town called <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> in nineteen thirty-seven <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> I was very lucky because I was extremely loved and cared for <pause dur="short"/> for the first eighteen months of my life <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> I think that made a big difference to me because my sister was less lucky and was born <pause dur="short"/> in February <pause dur="short"/> in nineteen thirty-nine <pause dur="short"/> and our dad was in the TA and he was called up very very quickly in fact before the outbreak of war because it was clear that war was probably coming and <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> we had to learn <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>v</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> really to live without our dad <pause dur="short"/> do you want to check it?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0486">ah it's okay it's okay</u>
<u n="3" who="S0508" trans="overlap">no it's okay <pause dur="short"/> well erm <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> I was looked after brilliantly by mother for the first three years <pause dur="short"/> as far as I was concerned it was lovely having mum all to myself but <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't of course so easy for her <pause dur="short"/> trying to manage two very young children <pause dur="short"/> by herself <pause dur="short"/> my dad was in the yeomanry <pause dur="short"/> er the <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> yeomanry and incredibly in nineteen thirty-nine he went to war with a horse isn't that extraordinary?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0486" trans="overlap">really?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0508">yes <pause dur="short"/> it was a horse called Bess and</u>
<u n="6" who="S0486">gosh</u>
<u n="7" who="S0508">off they went with erm <pause dur="short"/> er to the Middle East <pause dur="short"/> with horses <pause dur="short"/> and of course the poor horses were totally <pause dur="short"/> hopeless against tanks and what very rapidly happened was that the horses it was recognised that the horses were <pause dur="short"/> not useful and <pause dur="short"/> a great many of them had to be put down and a lot of them erm actually never got there because horses apparently can't be sick and the weather was terrible and so the horses that got seasick died</u>
<u n="8" who="S0486"><vocal desc="misc"/> oh</u>
<u n="9" who="S0508">so they had really horrible experience <pause dur="short"/> but back in <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> mum made friends with the other mothers of erm little children who were bank wives my father worked in Lloyds Bank in peace time and <pause dur="short"/> er it just so happened that <pause dur="short"/> my <pause dur="short"/> aunt who wasn't really an aunt who lived down the road <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> was married to a bank man also in Lloyds and he turned out to be <pause dur="short"/> absolutely incapable of coping with <pause dur="short"/> military life <pause dur="short"/> he was actually in the air rorce but he couldn't hack it and had a nervous breakdown and <pause dur="short"/> erm it was terribly disgraceful and there was much whispering going on in corners between aunt <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and mother erm <pause dur="short"/> but it was recognised that eventually that he <pause dur="short"/> he wasn't skiving he just couldn't cope and he went back to the bank so that was really lucky for me because I'd got a father substitute so there again he <pause dur="short"/> he selected me I was a very fanciful imaginative child so I got <pause dur="short"/> a a <pause dur="short"/> surrogate dad but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> hadn't <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was younger and a different child and she was tremendously devoted to mother <pause dur="short"/> and mother made it a lot of <trunc>f</trunc>fun for us she wasn't actually <pause dur="short"/> feeling a great sense of <pause dur="short"/> of fun erm but she knew how to make life fun for us <pause dur="short"/> and of course there was rationing but mother was very good at getting rabbits <pause dur="short"/> she used to get rabbits from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> went rabbiting <pause dur="short"/> with the Marquess of Bath <pause dur="short"/> on the <anon type="place"/> Estate and <pause dur="short"/> he was he would <trunc>c</trunc> have all sorts of rabbits under the counter of his fish shop <pause dur="short"/> and mother was one of his favourites <pause dur="short"/> mother had the most wonderful red hair she was absolutely gorgeous and she was very good at getting the rabbits</u>
<u n="10" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="11" who="S0508">and she used them for dual purpose because <pause dur="short"/> she was <pause dur="short"/> very keen on the Red Cross she'd <trunc>d</trunc> joined the Red Cross and aunt <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> looked after us aunt <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> didn't have any children and she looked after us on <pause dur="short"/> the days that mother went to the Red Cross and when mother had to practise dissection she practised on the rabbits because of course they came in their skin</u>
<u n="12" who="S0486">mm mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0508">and so mother would skin them and investigate their innards and learn all about rabbit interiors even if she wasn't too sure about human interiors and she loved the Red Cross <pause dur="short"/> and she used to take us for walks every day and she knew where the periwinkles grew and she knew <pause dur="short"/> er we would go to <pause dur="short"/> er the <pause dur="short"/> erm place called woodlands which was on the <anon type="place"/> Estate where there were marvellous bluebells and she knew that if we climbed up <pause dur="short"/> on to the railway embankment we could get white violets <pause dur="short"/> there were er mauve violets wood violets in the woods ah woodlands <pause dur="short"/> but for white violets we needed to go <pause dur="short"/> up on to the railway embankment <pause dur="short"/> which was not allowed but mother was very good at deciding that we could disobey the rules if we were with her <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> and she also took us to get snowdrops <pause dur="short"/> in at <anon type="place"/> which was another big country estate I guess you could get access to these places more easily probably in wartime <vocal desc="misc"/> and she knew about spindleberries and she knew where there was a spindleberry tree <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> she was just a lot of fun really even though there weren't many toys about and from the post office she would buy a colouring book <pause dur="short"/> and we had one I remember with birds in and we could choose a picture every day <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> colour it <pause dur="short"/> and choosing was big business very special occasion <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> when we had nearly finished the book she would say well now you can do <trunc>any</trunc> you can do all of them that's alright you can just you can do one and then you can do another if you want to and then there was a moment of very great excitement and then suddenly it wasn't exciting at all it was very boring because it was <pause dur="short"/> we could we could have anyone so we didn't want any of them we were tired of colouring and it was all spoiled <pause dur="short"/> and she taught us how to make raffia mats and she taught us how to make woollen balls <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> she made our clothes and that was terribly tiresome we didn't have many clothes <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> erm I had an aunt who knitted this was a real aunt my mother's younger sister and she knitted Fair Isle sweaters and we had kilts to go with those <pause dur="short"/> and they were just beautiful so we were very impressed with those but the making of the kilts was tiresome because you had to stand up on a little tuffy <pause dur="short"/> and have <pause dur="short"/> pins stuck into you and that was very tiresome <pause dur="short"/> and she would make dresses for us <pause dur="short"/> and again <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had a harder time than I did because we were dressed alike but <pause dur="short"/> she used to say <pause dur="short"/> that <pause dur="short"/> doing the first one was more fun and she always did the first one for me and then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got the second one and by the time she did the second one she was bit less she was a bit tired of it so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got the short straw again <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> dad sent things <pause dur="short"/> dad sent <pause dur="short"/> first of all ribbon <pause dur="short"/> er blue ribbon for me and a pink ribbon for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and this came from I don't know where but the ribbon arrived and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> couldn't remember him I could remember him <pause dur="short"/> erm but I didn't know what you did with the ribbon and mother had an idea and she gave us <pause dur="short"/> erm pieces of bamboo <pause dur="short"/> and we tied the ribbon on well I suppose she tied the ribbon on cos I don't think we would've been able to do <pause dur="short"/> bows but she tied the ribbon in a bow and then they were wands so we could wave them we could do all sorts of magic that was wonderful and then dad sent <pause dur="short"/> little filigree <pause dur="short"/> silver <pause dur="short"/> brooches they were butterflies and a big butterfly ours were quite little and a big butterfly for mother <vocal desc="misc"/> and then most wonderful of all he sent <pause dur="short"/> a beautiful blouse for mother which was <pause dur="short"/> erm a sort of erm natural colour with cream <trunc>em</trunc> erm no it was green embroidery <trunc>moth</trunc>mother with her beautiful erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> red hair and green eyes looked marvellous in green and she had a black suit and she would wear this lovely blouse erm with the green embroidery round the neck erm with her black suit and there were party dresses for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and for me <pause dur="short"/> and I felt very sorry for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s was <pause dur="short"/> er red embroidery on <pause dur="short"/> er white silk and mine was on a sort of cheesecloth <pause dur="short"/> which was a natural colour and it was <pause dur="short"/> marvellous rainbow colours the embroidery I thought mine was to die for I felt so beautiful <pause dur="short"/> but when I look back on it I think probably <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s was a great deal more subtle and more attractive <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> so we had our party dresses and we would put our <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> butterflies on our dresses <pause dur="short"/> and we felt the bee's knees and we even <pause dur="short"/> even in wartime <pause dur="short"/> went very occasionally to birthday parties <pause dur="short"/> but of course not very often <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> and erm <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>n</trunc> we we had a little trip to <anon type="place"/> I suppose mum wanted to send photographs of us to dad and we had polyphotos taken <pause dur="short"/> and polyphotos <pause dur="short"/> were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of little square photographs <pause dur="short"/> and erm and then you selected from all these masses and masses and masses and one was blown up and framed and was the special one the chosen one <vocal desc="misc"/> so erm I don't know exactly what was sent but we <trunc>h</trunc> I remember going to have these polyphotos taken in all our finery and er feeling very very grand <pause dur="short"/> but then in nineteen forty-three on about February the eighth when <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was just three <pause dur="short"/> there was a fire and of course you know all about <pause dur="short"/> that</u>
<u n="14" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="15" who="S0508">erm mother <pause dur="short"/> erm was <pause dur="short"/> it was the early morning we were in mother's bedroom and she had a gas fire against the wall and she put the fire on she got a dressing gown on and <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> it I don't know how it happened but the dressing gown caught fire</u>
<u n="16" who="S0486"><vocal desc="misc"/> ah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0508">and <pause dur="short"/> er <trunc>sh</trunc> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I were in mother's bed <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> I I just have a <trunc>s</trunc> blurred memory of it I can't remember it clearly <pause dur="short"/> but there were flames and flames and and <pause dur="short"/> it was all horrible and <pause dur="short"/> mother wrapped herself up in something which was it seemed as it she was shutting the <trunc>f</trunc>flames on herself but it was just the right</u>
<u n="18" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0508">thing do actually and she knew because of the Red Cross she'd learnt erm first aid and basic <pause dur="short"/> er erm <pause dur="short"/> response to <pause dur="short"/> flood and water and and er <trunc>f</trunc>fire and erm she knew that that was what you had to do and she did it <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember <pause dur="short"/> what happened next really <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I know mother always banged on the wall <pause dur="short"/> cos we didn't have a telephone <pause dur="short"/> but she could get help <pause dur="short"/> from <pause dur="short"/> erm Mrs <pause dur="short"/> what was she called? <pause dur="short"/> ah Mrs <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> Mrs <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> next door Mrs <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> a <trunc>b</trunc> queen bee of the <pause dur="short"/> wRVS or something she was a very important person anyway in the local <pause dur="short"/> hierarchy <pause dur="short"/> and Mrs <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was a great friend to mother and she turned up and I'm sure sorted out getting the doctor and the ambulance and all the rest of it <pause dur="short"/> so mother went to hospital and <pause dur="short"/> er we had fallen out of paradise <pause dur="short"/> and I can remember all this activity <pause dur="short"/> and standing at the bottom of the stairs saying we haven't had our porridge <pause dur="short"/> and the grown ups being very cross because I'd said that and I didn't understand why I had no idea really what had happened <pause dur="short"/> and I stayed at home granny and grandpa arrived <pause dur="short"/> and granny had had they had had ten children and were completely incapable of coping with <pause dur="short"/> us <pause dur="short"/> they were <pause dur="short"/> just not up to it <pause dur="short"/> to <trunc>ch</trunc> small children and <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I had just started <pause dur="short"/> school <pause dur="short"/> erm or I was just about to start school I can't remember <pause dur="short"/> but that was very very fortunate <trunc>m</trunc> oh yes mother remembered that she was making my <pause dur="short"/> buttercup coloured school blouses <pause dur="short"/> at I suppose ready for the next term <pause dur="short"/> erm when this <pause dur="short"/> accident happened <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> er first of all they thought she'd die she had third degree burns <pause dur="short"/> and then they kept her alive somehow or other and <pause dur="short"/> that was really really really lucky because <pause dur="short"/> they had just discovered <pause dur="short"/> erm really I think they were only being done for service men but they'd just discovered how to do</u>
<u n="20" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="21" who="S0508">erm grafts and <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> erm my father <pause dur="short"/> couldn't get home</u>
<u n="22" who="S0486">oh</u>
<u n="23" who="S0508">because was rather a lot going on <pause dur="short"/> in the war and I don't think you could just <pause dur="short"/> erm come home because you felt it would be a good idea <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> in <trunc>nin</trunc> in early nineteen forty-three but he did get home before the end of the war and when he got home he did <pause dur="short"/> get mother <pause dur="short"/> to <pause dur="short"/> er to see erm <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="24" who="S0486">oh yes</u>
<u n="25" who="S0508">so she was jolly lucky really and he <pause dur="short"/> had by this time trained some other people to do what he was doing and <pause dur="short"/> one of them was always known he was never ever I never discovered what his Christian name was he was Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and as far as mother was concerned he was god</u>
<u n="26" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="27" who="S0508">so god did when she eventually came to have her grafts they were done by god</u>
<u n="28" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0508">but erm <pause dur="short"/> they they were many and some were successful and some were not and <pause dur="short"/> redheads have very thin skin so she wasn't designed <pause dur="short"/> for grafting really anyway and erm <pause dur="short"/> it took a <trunc>l</trunc> it was she had her last <pause dur="short"/> operation <pause dur="short"/> in the early nineteen fifties so it was a long long slow business <pause dur="short"/> but for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and me it was pretty miserable have we done enough do you think?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0486">well let's have a look erm <pause dur="short"/> you you could <pause dur="short"/> I mean you you've done nineteen minutes at the moment do you want to go on for half an hour or not?</u>

<u n="158" who="S0486">is that she had a love affair in the war</u>
<u n="159" who="S0508">oh did she?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0486">yes erm obviously it was before the burns</u>

<u n="173" who="S0508">but <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't a great love affair <pause dur="short"/> and they certainly had trouble <pause dur="short"/> getting together again after the war but <pause dur="short"/> I think because probably because of mother's big romance <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>th</trunc> it she was able to to do it he was married anyway the romance and <pause dur="short"/> had a child <pause dur="short"/> so they agreed between them that they could not break up these all these <pause dur="short"/> situations and <trunc>th</trunc> just out of selfishness so I think they would've decided that anyway <pause dur="short"/> but erm</u>
