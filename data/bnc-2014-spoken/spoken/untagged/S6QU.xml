<u n="246" who="S0483">yeah</u>
<u n="247" who="S0482">how long does it take to go from a four to a six?</u>
<u n="248" who="S0483" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> depends on your hair growth and how fast it goes</u>
<u n="249" who="S0482" trans="overlap">yeah <unclear>well</unclear> yeah oh clever clogs <pause dur="short"/> I also realised that</u>
<u n="250" who="S0483" trans="overlap"><unclear>I do try</unclear></u>
<u n="251" who="S0482">you know I mean this is an obvious one but <pause dur="short"/> hairdressers have a</u>
<u n="252" who="S0483">mm</u>
<u n="253" who="S0482">conflict of interests when it comes to doing what you ask them to</u>
<u n="254" who="S0483" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="255" who="S0482">cos if you ask for something really short</u>
<u n="256" who="S0483">yeah</u>
<u n="257" who="S0482">but you're likely to come back with the same length of hair <trunc>if</trunc><trunc>if</trunc> as you've got when you are there</u>
<u n="258" who="S0483"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="259" who="S0482">then erm</u>
<u n="260" who="S0483">yeah maybe</u>
<u n="261" who="S0482" trans="overlap">it's their in their interest to <pause dur="short"/> not do it as short as you want it maybe</u>
<u n="262" who="S0483">mm yes</u>
<u n="263" who="S0482" trans="overlap">so that you come back sooner <pause dur="short"/> unless you like came every on the Monday of the first Monday of every month</u>
<u n="264" who="S0483" trans="overlap">some people do <trunc>b</trunc> yeah but I mean some people do do it <unclear>that way</unclear> really some people are very <unclear>keen</unclear></u>
<u n="265" who="S0482" trans="overlap">but I suspect a lot of men do it basically on the point which they realise that they have to go and get their hair cut</u>
<u n="266" who="S0483" trans="overlap">I don't know I think a lot of I think a lot of blokes do do it once a month or whatever you know</u>
<u n="267" who="S0482">and then that got me thinking</u>
<u n="268" who="S0483"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="269" who="S0482"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> I bet you hairdressers don't know actually what <pause dur="short"/> why what triggers people to go and get their hair cut</u>
<u n="270" who="S0483"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="271" who="S0482">so maybe they you can't can't tell</u>
<u n="272" who="S0483" trans="overlap"><unclear>well</unclear> I think they don't care</u>
<u n="273" who="S0482">no but they should care</u>
<u n="274" who="S0483"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="275" who="S0482">because if it is based on looks then they're better off not going as short as people ask <pause dur="short"/> so I remember when I once went into Toni and Guy's</u>
<u n="276" who="S0483">mm</u>
<u n="277" who="S0482">and paid a lot of money for a very stupid looking haircut</u>
<u n="278" who="S0483">yeah</u>
<u n="279" who="S0482">which annoyed me they'd barely cut my hair <pause dur="short"/> they'd styled it they hadn't cut it and I hadn't realised you</u>
<u n="280" who="S0483" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0482">they I thought you just get a you know I made the mistake of going to a hairdresser's salon when I should've gone to a barbers <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but of course in that case you're gonna come back all the time cos they barely even cut your hair <pause dur="short"/> just trimmed it</u>
<event desc="sound of phone"/>
<u n="282" who="S0482">is that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="283" who="S0483">yeah <pause dur="long"/> yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="284" who="S0482">sounds alright</u>
<u n="285" who="S0483">sounds alright</u>
<u n="286" who="S0482">basically I don't think hairdressers are looking into their clientele enough <pause dur="short"/> they should learn a bit more about them</u>
<u n="287" who="S0483">maybe</u>
<u n="288" who="S0482">they could you know I have it figured if they <pause dur="short"/> if they reduced <pause dur="short"/> the shortness of their cut by about twenty percent</u>
<u n="289" who="S0483" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="290" who="S0482">they could you know why shouldn't that increase revenue by twenty percent? or or close to that if a lot of people <trunc>ba</trunc> <trunc>t</trunc> go to get their hair cut based on the length of their hair rather than <pause dur="short"/> like every the first Monday of every month</u>
<u n="291" who="S0483">I'm thinking to myself that this is a two espresso recording</u>
<u n="292" who="S0482">what?</u>
<u n="293" who="S0483">as in that's how many you'd need to keep yourself awake while typing this up</u>
<u n="294" who="S0482">some people might appreciate my er musings on <pause dur="short"/> fixing other you know <trunc>y</trunc> er</u>
