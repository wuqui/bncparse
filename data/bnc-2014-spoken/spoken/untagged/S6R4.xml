<u n="192" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="193" who="S0092">but em they all all the people in the group said you've got to go in the high group you can't stay in this <pause dur="short"/> so I went to the high highest group cos everybody I started with just fell by the wayside</u>
<u n="194" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="195" who="S0092">or left or whatever <pause dur="short"/> and eh this higher group eh there wasn't enough there was only six and we needed eight so <pause dur="short"/> the reason we were at the university's cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he's one of them has been doing it for about for nine years <pause dur="short"/> he works at the university in security and</u>
<u n="196" who="S0018">yeah</u>

<u n="205" who="S0092">but he <trunc>lec</trunc> he lectures he's a very academic guy <pause dur="short"/> eh <trunc>Pe</trunc> is it Peter or something? But the thing is I didn't like him at first when he covered the lessons cos he was too pushy but now I can see a different side to him</u>
<u n="206" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="207" who="S0092">but you know what it is when you see you just see one aspect of something and</u>
<u n="208" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="209" who="S0092">sometimes people do take eh oh I don't like that</u>
<u n="210" who="S0018">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0092">so em</u>
<u n="212" who="S0018">but pushy in what way? That he was pushing you to speak more and learn more or?</u>
<u n="213" who="S0092">well eh when he'd covered everybody was away except me and this other woman so it was nonstop asking questions</u>
<u n="214" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="215" who="S0092">and stuff and I and he's he's a very academic sort of guy who he he was brought up in Norway eh and he's married to I don't know he's <pause dur="short"/> I think might might must be Norwegian but he says he's totally English and he's laid back but he's everything his jokes and everything are all very academic sort of jokes and I'm thinking <pause dur="short"/> you know so eh <pause dur="short"/> not that there's anything wrong with that it's just that eh sometimes it takes you a while to work out what's going on</u>
<u n="216" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="217" who="S0092">there's nothing worse than when you're in the group and everybody's laughing and you're thinking what the? You know and you can't look like you don't know what's going on <pause dur="short"/> so I'm thinking you know what's going on here? So I'm I'm blank to it all so eh</u>
<u n="218" who="S0018">do you feel you've improved a lot since you?</u>
<u n="219" who="S0092">ah my Norwegian's better but it's I'm doing a level in a way I it's too difficult for me</u>
<u n="220" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="221" who="S0092">but the others said to me so what you're learning because you're not realising it there's certain things that are sinking in even though you're not aware of it</u>
<u n="222" who="S0018">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="223" who="S0092">because because eh <pause dur="short"/> and also he realises I don't do all my homework all the time <pause dur="short"/> so he said you better do your homework</u>
<u n="224" who="S0018">naughty boy</u>
<u n="225" who="S0092">but sometimes I mean like anything I thought if I get if I'm stuck I'll go to ask my mum to help me because she's eighty <pause dur="short"/> but she did my homework anyway and she got it all wrong <vocal desc="laugh"/> I can't tell my mum because it's all cos she's the old Norwegian</u>
<u n="226" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="227" who="S0092">does the old Norwegian</u>
<u n="228" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="229" who="S0092">so eh</u>
<u n="230" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="231" who="S0092">you know and she's eighty-nine and I'm thinking <pause dur="short"/> you know I mean <pause dur="short"/> she <trunc>c</trunc> I mean she can read stuff but she's slow anyway <pause dur="short"/> but I forget that cos I just say you know if it's your own mother you just don't take that into if it was somebody else eighty-nine you'd think blimey</u>
<u n="232" who="S0018">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="233" who="S0092">but you don't do that on your own time you just expect I mean she still thinks I'm a <trunc>fi</trunc> fifteen to twenty-five year old kid <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> You know she just I go I went over there today and she goes here's an Easter egg for you</u>
<u n="234" who="S0018">aw</u>
<u n="235" who="S0092">here's your card</u>
<u n="236" who="S0018">that's a mum's prerogative though</u>
<u n="237" who="S0092">you know and I'm thinking if I'm sixty next year and she's treating me like I'm a so but that's that's <vocal desc="laugh"/> That is that isn't it? So</u>
<u n="238" who="S0018">but going back to you being in a higher class than maybe your level is that's actually quite good if you're  if you're  if you feel confident in that class</u>
<u n="239" who="S0092">well I'm</u>
<u n="240" who="S0018">as as opposed to just learning the language you're actually acquiring it</u>
<u n="241" who="S0092">when I'm in a group situation if I'm not confident with the topic I'll I'll I'll compensate by being more myself like I am now</u>
<u n="242" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="243" who="S0092">and I'll interrupt and say <pause dur="short"/> I'm a strategist I mean cos you're a teacher you can tell the strategy like you make out can you say that again or something? Even though you haven't got a clue what they're on about <pause dur="short"/> cos I'll think you're <pause dur="short"/> you know or you haven't done any questions except two so you make sure they know you've done these two or pretend you've done some other one</u>
<u n="244" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> You know all the tricks don't you? Being a teacher</u>
<u n="245" who="S0092">well I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I mean <pause dur="short"/> when you look at other kids cos when you're teaching a class and they're stuck you've got to work out why they're stuck</u>
<u n="246" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="247" who="S0092">and if you don't want to bollock them you've got to work out how to get the best out of them without making them feel that they're being sort of marginalised cos if you marginalise kids or people</u>
<u n="248" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="249" who="S0092">it's obvious if you've got any common sense what their reaction's gonna be they're just gonna get more marginalised and they're not gonna get involved</u>
<u n="250" who="S0018">yeah they'll be demotivated</u>
<u n="251" who="S0092">so eh I would work out strategies that eh blur the actual reality</u>
<u n="252" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="253" who="S0092">so that they feel part of it <pause dur="short"/> cos you're never taught that at <trunc>coll</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> when I went to em cos I taught for a year before I went to <trunc>un</trunc> my postgraduate education</u>
<u n="254" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="255" who="S0092">when I left Sheffield and got me I got my degree in chemical engineering and field technology and not maths <pause dur="short"/> but it was all physics maths chemistry and other things</u>
<u n="256" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="257" who="S0092">em then I left cos I cos my dad had just died <pause dur="short"/> I did cos I got my degree when I I'm a July baby so I actually did my degree when I was twenty</u>
<u n="258" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="259" who="S0092">I didn't I graduated when I was twenty and I didn't sort of <pause dur="short"/> and I didn't want to do a job straight away so I got a job in a factory in SelIy Oak I was working on a lathe cutting metal <pause dur="short"/> I worked in the post office I worked in the railways flogged tellys</u>
<u n="260" who="S0018">Butlins?</u>
<u n="261" who="S0092">Butlins <pause dur="short"/> and then I wrote to four different jobs <pause dur="short"/> I wrote to laboratory <pause dur="short"/> I wrote to a education authority I wrote eh to the police and I wrote I don't know if it was the army or something else I wrote to places where <pause dur="short"/> and I got a job teaching</u>
<u n="262" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="263" who="S0092">at <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> I hadn't got a teaching degree and it was I got eaten alive there</u>
<u n="264" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="265" who="S0092">but that was the best way to learn</u>
<u n="266" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="267" who="S0092">because then I went to <anon type="place"/> University and got my PGCE and all these other people I was with had just finished their degrees in <anon type="place"/> or nice universities</u>
<u n="268" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="269" who="S0092">and had just started when you're going to do teacher training and stuff</u>
<u n="270" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="271" who="S0092">I me I had come from a I had just been eaten alive in an inner city Birmingham school <pause dur="short"/> and I was listening to these lecturers talking about discipline and behaviour and I was listening and I thought these people haven't got a clue</u>
<u n="272" who="S0018">clue <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="273" who="S0092">about anything <pause dur="short"/> and these are telling me what to do</u>
<u n="274" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you'd had the baptism of fire hadn't you?</u>
<u n="275" who="S0092">so what happened was I ended up at eh I the schools I ended up <pause dur="short"/> it's <trunc>hi</trunc> there was <anon type="place"/> <anon type="place"/> a really rough area</u>
<u n="276" who="S0018">oh <anon type="place"/>'s yeah they're they're <unclear/></u>
<u n="277" who="S0092">mega rough <pause dur="short"/> and I got a job at <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="278" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="279" who="S0092">and the kids were all disturbed there and strangely enough they had Maths there you're doing alright here? I said yeah I know <pause dur="short"/> and then my tutor came in and they didn't like him and then I said <pause dur="short"/> and then I haven't got a car so what do they do? It's a terrible winter where did they send me on my main secondary practice they sent me to Derby <pause dur="short"/> I'm in Nottingham in a bedsit <pause dur="short"/> they send me to Derby when other people have got cars can teach in Nottingham <pause dur="short"/> so I have to get a bus in the morning to Derby then a bus out in to to <trunc>Mick</trunc> Mickleover</u>
<u n="280" who="S0018">how long did that take?</u>
<u n="281" who="S0092">bloody ages</u>
<u n="282" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="283" who="S0092">and then the head of the school at Mickleover where I was he ran a chess team and he found out I could play chess and I won all my games for him <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> And suddenly he if I had any discipline problems he used to sort it all out for me</u>
<u n="284" who="S0018">brilliant <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="285" who="S0092">and eh it was amazing really that eh you know <pause dur="short"/> my tutor came and watched me in one lesson and this kid called me a bastard <pause dur="short"/> and he he looked at me after he said that's terrible isn't it? I thought my god this guy is nuts</u>
<u n="286" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> It's quite polite from what I heard in the classroom</u>
<u n="287" who="S0092">but I know but the thing is what I  what I  realised when I left there was that the people running it aren't haven't got their finger on the pulse and even now</u>
<u n="288" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="289" who="S0092">if you're in the certain management situation you just want to maintain your job you don't want to ruin your job your immediate high people so you just pretend <pause dur="short"/> it's all let's pretend</u>
<u n="290" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="291" who="S0092">and the ones at the bottom are being eaten alive</u>
<u n="292" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="293" who="S0092">so what? It's their problem they're the ones that haven't got a proper strategy</u>
<u n="294" who="S0018">well I I just felt that eh the tutors in university knew that it was a completely unrealistic situation</u>
<u n="295" who="S0092">oh yeah</u>
<u n="296" who="S0018">but they were pretending that it wasn't just because</u>
<u n="297" who="S0092">okay <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="298" who="S0018">otherwise everything just breaks down I mean <pause dur="short"/> all the the classes that I was teaching I had a for example just for one class I had four visually impaired children four hearing impaired children <pause dur="short"/> about ten children with anger management issues who as soon as they felt angry they had a leave of absence to go and talk to someone about how to deal with their anger on the moment and then in during that time you have to have lessons aims for three different levels of the within each lesson <pause dur="short"/> so you're trying to teach three different classes at the same time</u>
<u n="299" who="S0092">mm</u>
<u n="300" who="S0018">while you've got all you've got to cater to the visually impaired students you've got to cater to the hearing impaired students <pause dur="short"/> and then all the anger management the eh these students that don't deal with their anger very well <pause dur="short"/> you've got all this to manage and then on top of that I don't know what it was like for maths but for teaching languages you have to prepare so much material <pause dur="short"/> and it's the fashion nowadays <trunc>n</trunc> not to rely on course books <pause dur="short"/> all the teachers that I saw in about three or four different schools that I visited they</u>
<u n="301" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="302" who="S0018">generate their own materials <pause dur="short"/> I mean you know probably from your Norwegian classes that in an hour you can get through about four or five bits of material</u>
<u n="303" who="S0092">mm</u>
<u n="304" who="S0018">that will stimulate conversation</u>
<u n="305" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="306" who="S0018">or stimulate you know reading skill or level</u>
<u n="307" who="S0092">Cos what he does cos it's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> we used the textbooks and she used to digress if we talked about making cake or something</u>
<u n="308" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="309" who="S0092">or a walk or something <pause dur="short"/> cos she used to she was one of these she was very funny <pause dur="short"/> she was wacky <pause dur="short"/> she had a hobby it was called <trunc>plan</trunc> I don't know was it planking or plaining? She used to get on places and</u>
<u n="310" who="S0018">oh planking yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="311" who="S0092" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> she used to bring pictures on her phone and anywhere on a mountain and</u>
<u n="312" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> A few people have died doing that haven't they? Trying to plank on bridges or cliffs</u>
<u n="313" who="S0092">and then this other one which something ironing where you have to put an ironing board</u>
<u n="314" who="S0018">on a motorway <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="315" who="S0092">or on the top of a hill or on a bloody <vocal desc="laugh"/> rock in the middle of nowhere I mean for god's sake but she was funny <pause dur="short"/> she was wacky but she was funny</u>
<u n="316" who="S0092">very crazy <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0018">yeah but I mean you know at least you know where you're coming from <pause dur="short"/> I well I I I felt sort of felt more and I don't know why I should feel more relaxed with people like that but I did <pause dur="short"/> sometimes if people are too serious and stuffy and stuff I don't feel relaxed with them</u>
<u n="318" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="319" who="S0092">I don't know why but em no I mean you've got to have a bit of eh you've got to have an edge somehow</u>
<u n="320" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="321" who="S0092">just to give some momentum in a situation</u>
<u n="322" who="S0018">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="323" who="S0092">otherwise and I mean that's the trouble and a lot of the people I work with <pause dur="short"/> eh I used to do crazy things all the time <pause dur="short"/> well crazy relative to what they'd say was crazy and I mean</u>
<u n="324" who="S0018">what in the classroom?</u>

<u n="328" who="S0018">very scary</u>
<u n="329" who="S0092">I know <pause dur="short"/> the only time I've ever been hit is trying to stop girls fighting</u>

<u n="336" who="S0018">so how did you cos one of the biggest problems I found in the classroom was I mean obviously your Norwegian class everyone who goes there is motivated</u>
<u n="337" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="338" who="S0018">they've got their internal motivation reasons that they want to learn</u>
<u n="339" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="340" who="S0018">so they come and they're happy to be there and they're happy to</u>
<u n="341" who="S0092">well</u>
<u n="342" who="S0018">participate <pause dur="short"/> but obviously as you know in classrooms in secondary schools</u>
<u n="343" who="S0092">well</u>
<u n="344" who="S0018">and also kids don't  kids don't  want to learn a foreign language <pause dur="short"/> they don't see the benefit of it</u>
<u n="345" who="S0092">I know that's I mean I know with maths <pause dur="short"/> but if I was doing <pause dur="short"/> as I said to you the other day you've got to have a combination I know it's difficult for women I mean I'm a big bloke and when you dress really smartly</u>
<u n="346" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="347" who="S0092">and you look after you make your hair all <unclear/> and you're clean shaven and you your voice projects a manner of eh I'm not gonna be messed about but you're not nasty with it</u>
<u n="348" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="349" who="S0092">so I have a mixture of fear they have a mixture of fear and <unclear/> Cos some teachers though they do not play up it's if it's more fear than anything else</u>
<u n="350" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="351" who="S0092">given an opportunity they'll like if they're away to cover <pause dur="short"/> but like with my form I had the same form five years and then I was another form I kept <pause dur="short"/> they used to em if I was away nobody played up they all did they everybody shut up because they were used to it</u>
<u n="352" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="353" who="S0092">and all the kids associated with the room that day my room as a place where nobody played up</u>
<u n="354" who="S0018">mm that's good</u>
<u n="355" who="S0092">and it's strange how you do <trunc>ass</trunc> associate a certain building or something <pause dur="short"/> or they won't play up as much they might play up a bit if I'm not there</u>
<u n="356" who="S0018">mm</u>

<u n="366" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="367" who="S0092">and then they were thinking no he isn't <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Cos I the new kids</u>
<u n="368" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="369" who="S0092">and then I used to say well I'm gonna have the first week I'm not gonna do any maths we're just gonna learn what you've got to do to be behave for me <pause dur="short"/> I said and I used to say I've got no control about what goes on with the rest of the school so if you doss around and mess about in somebody else's classes that's not my problem <pause dur="short"/> but I I looked at this nice top set of first years that came in and then I said I just stared I said everybody in here knows how to behave <pause dur="short"/> but you also know how to play up now don't you? And I pointed to this nice well you know girl sitting there <pause dur="short"/> and yes sir then I also who else knows how to play up? Put your hand up they all put their hand up I said see but you're not going to do that with me are you? No sir <pause dur="short"/> and you do that for the first week <pause dur="short"/> they'll not forget that that's there for the whole five years</u>
<u n="370" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="371" who="S0092">and then  And then  I said rules like you don't come late and then I used to say I don't want you to go on <unclear/> Why not? Can somebody tell me <pause dur="short"/> I want five reasons so I used to reinforce them from them</u>
<u n="372" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="373" who="S0092">I never used to eh go on and just say and what about your books? And I said here's a book and I said one and here's another one <pause dur="short"/> which one do you think if you were a teacher you'd tell a person off <pause dur="short"/> I'm getting them reinforcing what I want</u>
<u n="374" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="375" who="S0092">by getting them why? Somebody's put some graffiti on it <pause dur="short"/> what's what's that mean? And then they were telling me <pause dur="short"/> why isn't that a good idea? And then I set them a ruler <pause dur="short"/> what's that? It's a ruler <pause dur="short"/> now somebody told me that I should use that to hit people over the head with but and I <trunc>s</trunc> and they think  they think  is he a nasty so and so or what? And just try and smoulder about it thinking let me think about it</u>
<u n="376" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="377" who="S0092">but I only thought of a nail a drawing pin at one end <vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah they're really scared then <pause dur="short"/> and then I'd go on to say well who can tell me what a ruler is for? Drawing lines sir <pause dur="short"/> but what does he mean by that? I <trunc>mar</trunc> what a margin? And then I'd get them so I'd spend ages</u>
<u n="378" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="379" who="S0092">I don't just do it quickly so it all sinks in because the teachers worry about the bright children in class</u>
<u n="380" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="381" who="S0092">they're going to follow it anyway <pause dur="short"/> it's the ones that are going to give you trouble later on</u>
<u n="382" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="383" who="S0092">if you let that sink in big time at the start</u>
<u n="384" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="385" who="S0092">later on they might be they doing it with other and when they do start getting away with things with other people unless you've made a big deal about it you're going to be on the receiving end <pause dur="short"/> cos it's like a virus</u>
<u n="386" who="S0018">yeah yeah definitely</u>
<u n="387" who="S0092">but</u>
<u n="388" who="S0018">I think that's what had happened in my in the school that I was in that basically senior management</u>
<u n="389" who="S0092">what school was it?</u>
<u n="390" who="S0018">em the one I told you about last last week in Bournville?</u>
<u n="391" who="S0092">oh Bournville</u>
<u n="392" who="S0018">and I think senior management hadn't got just at the top-down discipline and so the <trunc>te</trunc> the teachers basically didn't have the support behind them to be able to to use discipline themselves</u>
<u n="393" who="S0092">was Nick Osbourne still there in PE?</u>
<u n="394" who="S0018">oh I don't know</u>

<u n="404" who="S0018">oh god</u>
<u n="405" who="S0092">in Bournville <pause dur="short"/> so really when you're looking for sympathy the worst thing is the shock is when you don't get it when you <pause dur="short"/> and so sometimes when you want to lean on somebody you can't and so you've gotta</u>
<u n="406" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="407" who="S0092">and that in a way you get inured in and hardened to <pause dur="short"/> it makes you stronger but at the time you feel really vulnerable I <trunc>fo</trunc> I found it or the police phoned me up five days later <pause dur="short"/> I was in Spark Hill in the inner city</u>
<u n="408" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="409" who="S0092">eh I had to start it with a screwdriver somebody had all my marking my tapes my books everything CDs they nicked</u>

<u n="411" who="S0092">yeah they they'd screwed the doors with a screwdriver the coursework nicked I was gonna mark</u>
<u n="412" who="S0018">oh no</u>
<u n="413" who="S0092">yeah I got in trouble over that</u>
<u n="414" who="S0018">you got in trouble?</u>
<u n="415" who="S0092">yeah initially I did till I told them <pause dur="short"/> eh and also the fact that I couldn't go anywhere without you know and I just felt bloody hell it's just gone where has it all gone to?</u>
<u n="416" who="S0018">oh no</u>
<u n="417" who="S0092">you know</u>
<u n="418" who="S0018">why would they steal coursework?</u>
<u n="419" who="S0092">they didn't know what was in it</u>
<u n="420" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="421" who="S0092">they just took everything and then just like what they do when they burgle a house <pause dur="short"/> if something looks and then they'll dump it later on won't they?</u>
<u n="422" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="423" who="S0092">so that was that</u>
<u n="424" who="S0018">and what did the kids have to do? Do the coursework again?</u>
<u n="425" who="S0092">no <pause dur="short"/> but in a way I thought that's good but some of them were crap they'll probably get an average mark now <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know what I mean? But these are things that happen to you and you just don't want them to happen again <pause dur="short"/> it's like a lot of things you know</u>
<u n="426" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="427" who="S0092">what people don't realise when they're younger anything you see somebody who's a lot older than them the things that happen to them the chances are fifty or sixty percent of the things happening to them you're gonna have</u>
<u n="428" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="429" who="S0092">or maybe more <pause dur="short"/> because part of living is not just having fantastic things happen to you</u>
<u n="430" who="S0018">yeah it's getting through the</u>
<u n="431" who="S0092">but things like</u>
<u n="432" who="S0018">awful things</u>
<u n="433" who="S0092">either meeting having a nasty experience with people or in that or a health scare</u>
<u n="434" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="435" who="S0092">or a job it may be losing a job or getting demoted</u>
<u n="436" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="437" who="S0092">or not keeping whatever or if you've got family split up or your kids are in trouble</u>
<u n="438" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="439" who="S0092">I'm not saying it's but it's a combination of them or</u>
<u n="440" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="441" who="S0092">even families that are sort of stable you know like <pause dur="short"/> cos I mean it's a tough time for middle classes now really</u>
<u n="442" who="S0018">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="443" who="S0092">because they they say they work hard and they've got all this and then all of a sudden they realise things have got to they've got to sacrifice things</u>
<u n="444" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="445" who="S0092">you know I mean my sister I mean my nephew is at <anon type="place"/> it's ten grand a term but I said may my wife's husband's on two hundred grand a year</u>
<u n="446" who="S0018">wow what does he do?</u>

<u n="452" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="453" who="S0092">so it's just luck really</u>
<u n="454" who="S0018">it is <pause dur="short"/> I'm waiting for a bit of luck <pause dur="short"/> I've had nothing but bad luck for the past ten years or so <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="455" who="S0092">but I mean you know I mean <pause dur="short"/> you might think you've had bad luck but you might meet other people who've had a lot worse</u>
<u n="456" who="S0018">yeah I know it's true <pause dur="short"/> that's when</u>
<u n="457" who="S0092">it's all</u>
<u n="458" who="S0018" trans="overlap">I went I got mugged when I was thirty and they broke my jaw I broke all my bones down my arm</u>
<u n="459" who="S0092">was this in Birmingham?</u>
<u n="460" who="S0018">no that was in Barcelona when I lived there</u>
<u n="461" who="S0092">Cos Barcelona I mean my my friends went there and em they got robbed</u>
<u n="462" who="S0018">oh it's yeah I was teaching I was training teachers to be English teachers and we'd have like thirty students every month and at least two of them would get mugged on a it was a monthly thing</u>
<u n="463" who="S0092">but then you didn't know that you'd been robbed till you got back to your?</u>
<u n="464" who="S0018">no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="465" who="S0092">they were really sophisticated</u>
<u n="466" who="S0018">yeah yeah yeah they they've got so many methods of doing it <pause dur="short"/> unfortunately well I was mugged about six times eh what robbed but the last time was a violent mugging cos they were on a motorcycle and they came up onto the pavement behind me and grabbed my bag off my arm but it had short straps so I ended up getting dragged behind the motorbike that was going about fifty kilometres an hour</u>
<u n="467" who="S0092">so they didn't intend to break your arm?</u>
<u n="468" who="S0018">no <pause dur="short"/> they didn't do it like</u>
<u n="469" who="S0092">I thought they were just gonna broke your arm</u>
<u n="470" who="S0018">no they didn't do it like</u>
<u n="471" who="S0092">oh</u>
<u n="472" who="S0018">here take this bang bang bang</u>
<u n="473" who="S0092">no I mean</u>
<u n="474" who="S0018">but still</u>
<u n="475" who="S0092">I know if it's the case it's the big place for robbery in the whole of Europe</u>
<u n="476" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="477" who="S0092">and Rome is not too good either they say</u>
<u n="478" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="479" who="S0092">but I mean you know when things like that happen it does make you well it takes a while to sort of feel confident to go out again</u>
<u n="480" who="S0018">definitely but I I would have got over that fine but the problem was that the consequences of me being ill I got sacked from my job for while I was off sick and I had to take them to court</u>
<u n="481" who="S0092">mm</u>
<u n="482" who="S0018">cos it was illegal what they'd done <pause dur="short"/> and then I hadn't had <trunc>d</trunc> the doctors hadn't diagnosed me properly <pause dur="short"/> I was complaining about my neck cos every week or so I'd get a bolt of lightning in my neck</u>
<u n="483" who="S0092">and what did they do?</u>
<u n="484" who="S0018">they just sent me to a lot of different specialists that told me</u>
<u n="485" who="S0092">is it sorted now?</u>
<u n="486" who="S0018" trans="overlap">kind of I still have problems <pause dur="short"/> it was a herniated disc in my neck</u>
<u n="487" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="488" who="S0018">and so I had to take so much time off on my next job</u>
<u n="489" who="S0092">mm</u>
<u n="490" who="S0018">because sometimes I couldn't even hold my head up eh or breathe properly <pause dur="short"/> that I lost that job as well and then the next job that I got teaching at Murcia University <pause dur="short"/> cos</u>
<u n="491" who="S0092">which university?</u>
<u n="492" who="S0018">in Murcia in Spain</u>
<u n="493" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="494" who="S0018">and cos they did dodgy work contracts over there because they don't want to make you permanent because they have to</u>
<u n="495" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="496" who="S0018">pay more social security for you</u>
<u n="497" who="S0092">right</u>
<u n="498" who="S0018">and so Murcia University were illegally employing us and one of teachers complained to the department of employment who came and did a big inspection and and said <trunc>we</trunc> we're fining you half a million Euros and you're no longer allowed to employ people on these contracts <pause dur="short"/> so they just terminated everybody's contract and only took on teachers who had the civil service em</u>
<u n="499" who="S0092">so anyway you got punished for?</u>
<u n="500" who="S0018" trans="overlap">yeah it was just being bang bang bang and that's</u>
<u n="501" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="502" who="S0018">in the end the reason why I moved back to England and thought I'll carry on being a teacher I'll do a PGCE</u>
<u n="503" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="504" who="S0018">and then it was the difference it was just such a shock to get into</u>
<u n="505" who="S0092">behaviour</u>
<u n="506" who="S0018" trans="overlap">the behaviour was a nightmare I mean I've taught all ages and levels of kids in Spain and yeah there's you know they are they're kids aren't they?</u>
<u n="507" who="S0092">mm</u>
<u n="508" who="S0018">they're gonna play out they're gonna misbehave but there was no hostility there was no violence</u>
<u n="509" who="S0092">how many schools have you taught in here then? Was it all secondary schools?</u>
<u n="510" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="511" who="S0092">if you get have you ever thought of private schools?</u>
<u n="512" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="513" who="S0092">I mean you could still get them playing up but they play up in a totally different way</u>
<u n="514" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="515" who="S0092">eh I don't know I mean it's <trunc>la</trunc> the good thing is I think language you're at an advantage now because some of the news headlines the other day about they haven't got enough interpreters</u>
<u n="516" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="517" who="S0092">for criminals <pause dur="short"/> there's a massive problem now with recruitment getting people to do languages so I think if if someone changes</u>
<u n="518" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="519" who="S0092">in your I mean what language would you be able to teach just Spanish or?</u>
<u n="520" who="S0018">french and Spanish yeah and because of the EBac that is in at the moment is being brought in</u>
<u n="521" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="522" who="S0018">you know a language for a lot of people is gonna be essential</u>
<u n="523" who="S0092">oh you?</u>
<u n="524" who="S0018">to get their EBac so I think there's going to be quite a lot of teaching jobs</u>
<u n="525" who="S0092">it's just that I</u>
<u n="526" who="S0018">but I just don't know whether I'll be able to cope I mean you say that all teachers and are so stressed and don't get to enjoy their holidays cos they're always working</u>
<u n="527" who="S0092">well the thing is I mean it might sound bad in one way but because I wasn't married or had kids myself</u>
<u n="528" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="529" who="S0092">in a way it was a benefit in one way because some of them used to go home and I'm not saying their marriages were on the rocks but to have their strong marriage you're got to put a lot in to it</u>
<u n="530" who="S0018">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="531" who="S0092">and so that means you've got to be eh either understanding or say you have eh not in the right frame of mind one way and you've got to do A B C D and you if I come home I don't want to do anything I just used to do what I liked</u>
<u n="532" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="533" who="S0092">which is basically either soak in the bath or go to bed eh or just chill out</u>
<u n="534" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="535" who="S0092">and I mean I I I I didn't know I had diabetes for a while so I'd end up going on that <pause dur="short"/> I used to get my blood pressure checked regularly and then it wasn't that long cos if it was too long it would cause all the damage but eh <pause dur="short"/> so I must have been at school working and I was wondering why I was tired and stuff</u>
<u n="536" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="537" who="S0092">but there must be other teachers going in and having other things going on with them <pause dur="short"/> but partly I think some of the stress must affect create a situation where it makes you ill</u>
<u n="538" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure of it</u>
<u n="539" who="S0092">so you know and it is a stressful job <pause dur="short"/> I mean I eh I started teaching in nineteen seventy-five</u>
<u n="540" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="541" who="S0092">I stopped I retired in two thousand and eight <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's not long in compared to some but it is long enough when think about the intensity of the job you're on your feet all day <pause dur="short"/> I used to get in I used to leave the house at about <trunc>tw</trunc> quarter past seven</u>
<u n="542" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="543" who="S0092">so I could get on the photocopier and then chill before we started</u>
<u n="544" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="545" who="S0092">so is it was only the last fifteen years at Hall Green <pause dur="short"/> it isn't that far but there's nothing worse if you've got a long train journey or traffic</u>
<u n="546" who="S0018">it was taking me two hours to get to the other side of Birmingham</u>
<u n="547" who="S0092">what side did you live then?</u>
<u n="548" who="S0018">em Solihull</u>
<u n="549" who="S0092">you live in Solihull and you had to get to Bournville?</u>
<u n="550" who="S0018">yeah public transport</u>
<u n="551" who="S0092">what time what route did you go?</u>
<u n="552" who="S0018">I'd catch the thirty-seven down to Acocks Green</u>
<u n="553" who="S0092">yeah</u>
<u n="554" who="S0018">and then get the eleven around to the Bristol Road</u>
<u n="555" who="S0092">yeah</u>

<u n="562" who="S0018">it was such a shame but yeah I was spending four hours a day travelling <pause dur="short"/> and then getting home at night and then you've got to plan your lessons for the next time and</u>
<u n="563" who="S0092">so how long were you at Bournville for?</u>
<u n="564" who="S0018" trans="overlap">eh four months <pause dur="short"/> it was my first</u>

<u n="635" who="S0092">men will think oh no I don't  I don't  that's a good idea <pause dur="short"/> we should stop there and if you've worked for a boss that's totally determined they're scary some of them that eh <pause dur="short"/> and the way they bully each other as well <pause dur="short"/> when women bully women it's a lot worse than men bullying men <vocal desc="laugh"/> I mean I saw it when I <unclear/> with girls just over the interview and some woman was ranting down some other woman's earhole and the woman getting bullied was this head of department <pause dur="short"/> and I'm thinking Jesus Christ what kind of people are they?</u>

You go in the blokes urinals there you saw about five thousand urinals it's got the biggest gents toilet I've ever been in and I'm thinking this is a girls school they don't have as many men anyway <pause dur="short"/> it's got the biggest amount of toilets you could have a bloody three classrooms in there <vocal desc="laugh"/> I just couldn't get my head around it I thought what? <vocal desc="laugh"/> You know how things strike you and you just want to know why and I couldn't I still can't for the life of me understand why you know and people say and I said well</u>
<u n="642" who="S0018">it sounds quite <trunc>ty</trunc> typical of the logic that is in operation in a lot of schools <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="643" who="S0092">oh tell me about it <pause dur="short"/> but em there were the reason I like teaching for me personally it's nothing <pause dur="short"/> no matter what system's in operation I still do me own thing</u>
<u n="644" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="645" who="S0092">and eh and if they don't like it they'll try and sort of some of the bully types will make some threats but with me it won't work because I'll just play the game and then if they start getting nasty I'll just I won't it's like what people do they just pretend nothing is there and I mean I've been threatened by her management</u>

<u n="650" who="S0018">oh really? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="651" who="S0092">you know <pause dur="short"/> but the thing is once they'd guarantee me is just digging my heels in</u>
<u n="652" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="653" who="S0092">is somebody coming around it's like you know actually I mean I'm not a tough hard guy but if people start doing that I'll I'll I won't act hard to them but I won't back off</u>
<u n="654" who="S0018">mm</u>

<u n="667" who="S0092">and they're talking about scroungers and all that or whatever <pause dur="short"/> but the thing is when you think about it it makes sense because it's all this country there's a lot of a little different many worlds</u>
<u n="668" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="669" who="S0092">everywhere</u>

<u n="694" who="S0018">yeah</u>
