<u n="1" who="S0493"><vocal desc="laugh"/> they said they didn't have enough Welsh</u>
<u n="2" who="S0492" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">yeah where is he from?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0493" trans="overlap">accents actually</u>
<u n="4" who="S0492" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="5" who="S0493" trans="overlap">but in the thing there you are <pause dur="short"/> right so this is a game called Love Letter right?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0492" whoConfidence="low">uhu</u>
<u n="7" who="S0493">and er <pause dur="short"/> we are trying to eliminate all the other players from the game okay right? and then you're the winner <pause dur="short"/> here's a list of the different types of cards they do and the different values they give you right? <pause dur="short"/> so in this pack of sixteen cards there are if you look at the bottom there are five guards right?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0492" whoConfidence="low">mm hm</u>
<u n="9" who="S0493">and this is what a guard looks like if you have the guard in your hands</u>
<u n="10" who="S0492" whoConfidence="low"><unclear/></u>
<u n="11" who="S0493">and you use it to eliminate</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="12" who="S0493" trans="overlap">a player</u>
<u n="13" who="S0497">shush I'm listening</u>
<u n="14" who="S0493">you guess the erm the identity of someone else's card which you can you <trunc>w</trunc> you'll er you'll understand how to do that when we play the game but <pause dur="short"/> er okay so you just say right <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> if I if I play a guard I'll say <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I think you are a prince because there's two princes if it's correct he's eliminated <pause dur="short"/> if it's not correct we just continue playing</u>
<u n="15" who="S0492">uhu</u>
<u n="16" who="S0493">okay? so there's five guards right? <pause dur="short"/> there are two priests</u>
<u n="17" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0493" trans="overlap">when you play a priest you just choose one person from the table and you say I wanna secretly see your card so if I play that to you <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I'll say <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> show me your cards you show me your card now I know what it is</u>
<u n="19" who="S0496">okay</u>
<u n="20" who="S0493" trans="overlap">then maybe the next round if I have a guard I'll say <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you are the princess because I've seen in the previous round you are the princess</u>
<u n="21" who="S0496">okay</u>
<u n="22" who="S0493" trans="overlap">alright? okay so there's to priests five guards two priests</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="23" who="S0492"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> why don't you come round to nanny?</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="24" who="S0492">come round come to me</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="25" who="S0497">you go to nanny then <anon type="name" nameType="n"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0493">okay there's two barons</u>
<u n="27" who="S0492" whoConfidence="low">you got her babe?</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="28" who="S0497"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she's not gonna come to me</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="29" who="S0496" trans="overlap">come on climb up sorry</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="30" who="S0492">right two barons yeah?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0493" trans="overlap">okay so also you'll see that they all have different values right?</u>
<u n="32" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0493">at the end of the game if people aren't eliminated the person with the value card at the end of the game wins</u>
<u n="34" who="S0492">mm hm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0493" trans="overlap">right?</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="36" who="S0493">so it goes from one two three up till eight so the princess has got a value of eight and she's like the most powerful character right?</u>
<u n="37" who="S0497">why is she more powerful than anything?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0496" whoConfidence="low"><unclear/></u>
<u n="39" who="S0493" trans="overlap">that's how ah well <pause dur="short"/> cos this isn't a sexist</u>
<u n="40" who="S0497" trans="overlap">it's irrelevant</u>
<u n="41" who="S0493" trans="overlap"><trunc>El</trunc> er Elizabethan yeah I don't know okay so with the baron what a baron does you play the baron <pause dur="short"/> and then you compare the other remaining card in your hands with another player <pause dur="short"/> the person whose lowest is eliminated so if I play the baron and in my hand I've got a king and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has got a handmaid we compare hands I've got six he's got four</u>
<u n="42" who="S0497">right</u>
<u n="43" who="S0493" trans="overlap">so he's eliminated</u>
<u n="44" who="S0492" whoConfidence="low">okay</u>
<u n="45" who="S0493">during the game you'll work out I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has probably either got a countess or a baron based on the way he's played so you'll be able to see that and that's how you can kind of eliminate him by guessing what <trunc>ki</trunc> what card he's got yeah?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0492" whoConfidence="low">okay</u>
<u n="47" who="S0493">okay it's number four is a handmaiden there's two handmaiden a handmaiden just means nobody can attack you for one round <pause dur="short"/> so you can't use a guard on somebody you can't use a priest on them you can't use a baron on them <pause dur="short"/> this is like a blocker like a defence like a Sergio Ramos</u>
<u n="48" who="S0492" whoConfidence="low">mm hm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0493" trans="overlap">you play it and nobody can attack you for a round yeah? <pause dur="short"/> yeah? <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0497">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0493" trans="overlap">yeah okay <pause dur="short"/> er then there are two princes</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="52" who="S0497">is that my thing?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0493">there's two princes a prince you just had another person <trunc>d</trunc>discard their cards <pause dur="short"/> so they've got to pick up a new card or if you don't like the card in your hands you can discard your card and pick up a new card</u>
<u n="54" who="S0497">oh great yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0493" trans="overlap">doesn't really do so much that card it's not that good but it's a number five this is a number six there's only one of these <pause dur="short"/> you trade hands with a player so you give them your other card and you take their card off them <pause dur="short"/> yeah? so you just swap you swap cards</u>
<u n="56" who="S0497">it's a butterfly</u>
<u n="57" who="S0493">number seven doesn't do anything but like it's really high up yeah? number seven is gonna win you the if it comes to a baron or it comes to the end of the game number seven is probably gonna win you the game er if you have a prince or a king in your hand you have to discard the countess</u>
<u n="58" who="S0496" whoConfidence="low">okay</u>
<u n="59" who="S0493" trans="overlap">so if I discard it people are gonna know in my other you always have two cards oh I should have said that <pause dur="short"/> if I <trunc>dis</trunc> if I play the countess you know that I've probably got</u>
<u n="60" who="S0497">a prince or</u>
<u n="61" who="S0493" trans="overlap">a prince or a king but maybe I'll play this and I and I've got a baron just to put you off so you</u>
<u n="62" who="S0492" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">uhu</u>
<u n="63" who="S0493" trans="overlap">gets oh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the other card is a <trunc>b</trunc> is a prince and it's not right? <pause dur="short"/> and then the final guard is a prince the final card is the princess princess is worth eight which doesn't do anything and if you discard it at any time <pause dur="short"/> then you've lost so if <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has got the prince and he says <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> discard your card and I discard the princess I've lost immediately so she has no power these two have no power but they've just got really high numbers</u>
<u n="64" who="S0492" whoConfidence="low">right</u>
<u n="65" who="S0497">okay</u>
<u n="66" who="S0493">you'll pick it up it's really easy</u>
<u n="67" who="S0497">I was gonna say er your round</u>
<u n="68" who="S0496" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">sounds it</u>
<u n="69" who="S0493">okay</u>
<u n="70" who="S0496">sounds dead complicated</u>
<u n="71" who="S0493">it's really</u>
<u n="72" who="S0492" trans="overlap">it's not</u>
<u n="73" who="S0493">honestly</u>
<u n="74" who="S0496" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="75" who="S0493" trans="overlap">I'm I'm probably making it sound a lot more complicated than it is</u>
<u n="76" who="S0496" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">well no no</u>
<event desc="begin overlap"/>
<u n="77" who="S0497"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> hello <pause dur="short"/> are you tired? you're getting tired aren't you?</u>

<u n="2889" who="S0496">yeah</u>
<u n="2890" who="S0493">which means these tunnels and they go to a mountain regions which is harder to make a connection and it's a risk so you give your two to the your two blues to the bank then we have to turn over three cards from the deck <pause dur="short"/> one two three as there's a blue come out which you which you don't want that means you have to pay an extra blue or an or a multicolour remember the multicolour ones?</u>
<u n="2891" who="S0496">mm hm</u>
<u n="2892" who="S0493">to make a successful tunnel if you don't have extra blue or you don't have an extra multicolour then you have to wait till your next turn so when you're trying to get a tunnel it's always good to have like a multicolour as a backup insurance thing</u>
