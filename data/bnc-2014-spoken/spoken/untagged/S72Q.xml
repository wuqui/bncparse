<u n="142" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="143" who="S0120">lots of people involved <pause dur="short"/> he was one of the em em ICE president's apprentices a couple of years ago</u>

<u n="161" who="S0120">em I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I think it's probably more a matter of just anyone can nominate someone</u>
<u n="162" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> fair enough</u>
<u n="163" who="S0120">Cos this year  this year  another EWB person em got a em a commendation in the graduate awards</u>
<u n="164" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0120">didn't she wasn't an official runner up you know there were a couple of official runners up and there was a winner and then there were a few</u>

<u n="172" who="S0058">of course yes he did <pause dur="short"/> that's possibly why</u>
<u n="173" who="S0120">mm <pause dur="short"/> I guess cos until like a I think it was until last year em last year the em em national service was em</u>
<u n="174" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0120">was rescinded in Germany</u>

<u n="178" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="179" who="S0120">hardly heard anything about it <pause dur="short"/> I just eh kinda found out at one point when I was in a bit of a Wiki quest for something</u>
<u n="180" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> yeah there wasn't much of a fanfare about it <pause dur="short"/> it was quite a so so what happens now? Have have they just completely stopped or is there kind of is it just a bit more relaxed or?</u>
<u n="181" who="S0120">I think</u>
<u n="182" who="S0058">it was already quite relaxed though wasn't it?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0120">no <pause dur="short"/> I think it's just now</u>
<u n="184" who="S0058">just you just don't have to do it</u>
<u n="185" who="S0120">the same it's the same for everyone as it used to be for women optional</u>
<u n="186" who="S0058">well that makes sense <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="187" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0058">oh I hadn't actually thought about that the fact that what did they do about the women</u>
<u n="189" who="S0120">so I mean the majority of people would do zivildienst anyway</u>
<u n="190" who="S0058">would do what sorry?</u>
<u n="191" who="S0120">zivildienst</u>
<u n="192" who="S0058">civil</u>
<u n="193" who="S0120">so if you'd send them a letter saying you know I'm a pacifist and I do not want to do this</u>
<u n="194" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="195" who="S0120">lots of people aren't necessarily pacifists but do</u>

<u n="197" who="S0120">don't want to do it</u>
<u n="198" who="S0058">fair enough</u>
<u n="199" who="S0120">em em but then you em can do your national service as em well social work</u>
<u n="200" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="201" who="S0120">kind of thing em which I think would be a really good thing</u>
<u n="202" who="S0058">I was just about to say that would really make a lot of sense <pause dur="short"/> cos it would mean that everyone had something to do and everyone would have some kind of positive experience</u>
<u n="203" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="204" who="S0058">you know and you could do you know whatever suited you better and yeah they could really get quite a lot out of that <pause dur="short"/> it seems to make sense</u>
<u n="205" who="S0120">if civil service didn't already mean something else in English</u>
<u n="206" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="207" who="S0120">then it'd be a good eh good name</u>
<u n="208" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yes indeed</u>
