<u n="655" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah I do I well I like I like learning but I don't like the system I feel it's very restrictive I want to do my own learning <pause dur="short"/> I want to learn what I want to learn and do my own studying</u>
<u n="656" who="S0423">well it's a bit more like that at university <unclear/></u>
<u n="657" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah maybe I'll just well I'll maybe I'll do a PhD and then I'll be like a a professor</u>
<u n="658" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> why not?</u>
<u n="659" who="S0421">and do research I don't know cos to be a professor you have to teach others and I don't know whether I want to do that I don't really want to teach others</u>
<u n="660" who="S0423">well you just have to I suppose if you're not sure what you do wanna do just try to get your best marks and your studies and then take it from there</u>
<u n="661" who="S0421">I'd like to have PhDs away when either way though</u>
<u n="662" who="S0423">why? so we all have to call you professor?</u>
<u n="663" who="S0421">well well you can't you can't be professor unless you teach but I will be doctor <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="664" who="S0423">why would you like to have a PhD? just so you you know <unclear/></u>
<u n="665" who="S0421">well because I don't like it just seems like good because you can just er do it for a year on whatever you want erm <pause dur="short"/> and like if I'm gonna be doing my own research about stuff anyway I might as well get a PhD out of it</u>
<u n="666" who="S0423">and can you do that while you're working?</u>
<u n="667" who="S0421">erm yeah you can do it part time yeah <pause dur="long"/> but you don't get a loan for it</u>
<u n="668" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="669" who="S0421">you don't get a loan for a <trunc>mast</trunc>masters either you've just gotta pay it</u>
<u n="670" who="S0423">really?</u>
<u n="671" who="S0421">mm mm <pause dur="long"/> I think so they might give you a bit I don't know I don't think they do though <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="672" who="S0423">like what what's that seven thousand a year?</u>
<u n="673" who="S0421">no it's probably nine thousand again <pause dur="short"/> everything's nine thousand now</u>
<u n="674" who="S0423">is it just would you just how many years would you study for it? just like an extra year?</u>
<u n="675" who="S0421">yeah masters is <trunc>an</trunc>another year and then a PhD is another year <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="676" who="S0423">so it's quite it's pretty expensive to <unclear/> isn't it?</u>
<u n="677" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="678" who="S0423">if I've got to already have a good job <unclear/></u>
<u n="679" who="S0421">yeah <pause dur="short"/> because like erm when I was going round <anon type="place"/> they were like oh yes many of our students choose to stay on and do masters and PhD full time and I'm like oh I wonder which ones those are? the ones with lots of money</u>
<u n="680" who="S0423">well there was something in the paper a while back I don't know if I told you there was just a bloke who who wanted to do his masters and er be accepted and to a point they realised he didn't have any money in the bank said well how are you gonna afford to to live? I think he could pay for the <pause dur="short"/> the course</u>
<u n="681" who="S0422">yeah</u>
<u n="682" who="S0423">but they said to do this course you need we expect you to have this much money in the bank so <unclear>they've all</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> said what what are you going to do to to live? and he said well I I <unclear>have to</unclear> have a job part time <unclear>or whatever</unclear></u>
<u n="683" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="684" who="S0423">and he had some money said oh that's not enough and cos he <unclear>was going to gonna</unclear> supplement <unclear>income and they and they well they</unclear> rejected him for that reason but I think he took them to court or something</u>
<u n="685" who="S0421">oh right</u>
<u n="686" who="S0423">and I think he <unclear>forgot to apply in the end but</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> <unclear>masters</unclear> but I think they had some rules then you have to have so much all of your living costs <unclear>already in</unclear> the bank <unclear>for the year</unclear> and they decided how much you have to live on</u>
<u n="687" who="S0421">what?</u>
<u n="688" who="S0423">it seems ridiculous that it's not really any of their business <unclear/></u>
<u n="689" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah that's weird</u>
<u n="690" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="long"/> so <unclear><anon type="name" nameType="f"/></unclear> saying that you you're not to be doing anything else just your masters and not you have to have all your money ready to live on <unclear>you have to enough obviously</unclear></u>
<u n="691" who="S0421">yeah I know that like some places encourage you like I know at <anon type="place"/> they were like oh it's it's best not to have a part time job</u>
<u n="692" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="693" who="S0421">er just to focus on your your studying and stuff but I'd say that most universities are like oh it's okay to work and study at the same time</u>
<u n="694" who="S0423">yeah I think so many students do they have to <unclear/> like that don't think there's any <unclear/> <pause dur="long"/> so when when do you know where you're going and everything? what you you have to wait till you get your results?</u>
<u n="695" who="S0421">no I know I'm going now cos I'm unconditional</u>
<u n="696" who="S0423">right but <pause dur="short"/> when when you get have you had like do they give you like a formal offer or anything?</u>
<u n="697" who="S0421">yeah I've had it</u>
<u n="698" who="S0423">oh right right so can you not are you not gonna start so sorting out your accommodation now?</u>
<u n="699" who="S0421">well it they they do it all at the same time it'll be in June it opens and then you apply for it</u>
<u n="700" who="S0423">well well how can the other students who haven't had the offer?</u>
<u n="701" who="S0421" trans="overlap">they can't apply for it yet either</u>
<u n="702" who="S0423">no how can they do it in June?</u>
<u n="703" who="S0421">oh well they apply for the accommodation</u>
<u n="704" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="705" who="S0421">erm because by making it your firm it's like the assumption that yes you're going to get the grades you're gonna go there</u>
<u n="706" who="S0423" trans="overlap">what so you can still <unclear>get</unclear> you get it sorted in advance?</u>
<u n="707" who="S0421">yeah like so everybody you you you treat it as though yes you are going there like you expect to get those results</u>
<u n="708" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>erm</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> yep</u>
<u n="709" who="S0421">erm <pause dur="short"/> and then if you don't then obviously you sort out your accommodation for the other university</u>
<u n="710" who="S0423">yep <pause dur="short"/> I don't understand how it it seems quite complicated they must <unclear>though</unclear> oversubscribe them cos not everybody's gonna get the results are they?</u>
<u n="711" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="712" who="S0423">but then if everybody <unclear>did get</unclear> the results</u>
<u n="713" who="S0421" trans="overlap">but then</u>
<u n="714" who="S0423">they won't have any places</u>
<u n="715" who="S0421">yeah I I don't know how they do it because there'll be people who've got it as like their insurance so like the second choice so then if they fall through from their first university they'll go to <anon type="place"/> so I assume it works as though the people who didn't get into <anon type="place"/> so the room will free up and then the insurance people can go in that one but I don't know how they get it to fit so neatly</u>
<u n="716" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="long"/> I guess that's why they've have UCAS is it UCAS does all the? <pause dur="short"/>  if somebody doesn't have a place or a university have got places or</u>
<u n="717" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah they sort they sort out the places and everything but like the university does the accommodation and they guarantee you accommodation</u>
<u n="718" who="S0423">for the first year</u>
<u n="719" who="S0421">for the first year if you're if it's your firm choice so</u>

<u n="738" who="S0423">oh right <unclear>okay</unclear> <pause dur="long"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="739" who="S0421">because you have to put your two options in I think</u>

<u n="755" who="S0421">I think whatever they took was mixed with something what I don't know</u>
