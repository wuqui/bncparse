<u n="589" who="S0555">but humans like cos cos at a hunter gatherer stage it made more sense to have like <pause dur="short"/> a a specific unit between people like one person to go and forage and hunt another person to raise a child and maybe also forage as well</u>
<u n="590" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> yeah yeah</u>

<u n="670" who="S0555" trans="overlap">I think the <trunc>re</trunc> the reason that we can't is mostly because of the fact that when we develop we <pause dur="short"/> because of the fact that we're so successful we developed such large brains and now we're and <pause dur="short"/> now we are too complicated to compare to primates who who</u>

<u n="678" who="S0405">there are ways to look at primate anthropology in the right way and there are ways to do it the wrong way and most people do it the wrong way in that <pause dur="short"/> they get really defensive because if they all <pause dur="short"/> they just assume that people are just looking at primates and just making these ridiculous connections the only reason we'd look at them is to look at an evolutionary history and try and identify trends as to why we develop certain either instinctive behaviours or er physiological erm or psychological motivations for why we do things</u>
<u n="679" who="S0555" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="680" who="S0405">but that doesn't always include the idea of nurture or the idea of our society the kind of effects that they have <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> so you know it's just important to look at things in the right way <pause dur="short"/> the point you made about erm <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> you said you think most sort of tribal cultures would be polygamous</u>
<u n="681" who="S0402">yeah yeah <unclear/> lot</u>
<u n="682" who="S0405" trans="overlap">how about <pause dur="short"/> well roughly <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> right yeah erm <pause dur="short"/> how about the idea so do you think erm <pause dur="short"/> so basically if you look at tribal cultures the vast majority of them except this one tribe one single instance where it's the other way round most of those are polygamous in that it's <trunc>ma</trunc> of one male and multiple females</u>
<u n="683" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="684" who="S0405">whereas this one tribe in Tibet or former Tibet that was <pause dur="short"/> multiple males and one female</u>
<u n="685" who="S0402">mm <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="686" who="S0405">so why do you think it was <pause dur="short"/> why do you think that <pause dur="short"/> do you think it it do you think our biology promotes having that kind of polygamous culture? or do you think it's just individual circumstances or do you think?</u>
<u n="687" who="S0555">well because women can like <pause dur="short"/> women's <pause dur="short"/> I think I feel like the idea that women are pregnant and they need to be <pause dur="short"/> cared for by a man if there are multiple women <pause dur="short"/> then he needs more protection to do something for all of them <unclear/></u>
<u n="688" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="689" who="S0405" trans="overlap">yeah yeah right <pause dur="short"/> it's more practical <pause dur="short"/> right yeah</u>
<u n="690" who="S0555">it's just easier</u>
<u n="691" who="S0402" trans="overlap">but isn't that just part of <unclear/> who the father is?</u>

<u n="702" who="S0402" trans="overlap">I think it's just <pause dur="short"/> I would say from a <pause dur="short"/> a kind of logistical stand point it's easier to have one man <pause dur="short"/> because like a woman's only gonna produce an egg every month</u>
<u n="703" who="S0554">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="704" who="S0405" trans="overlap">whereas a man can basically produce sperm on point</u>

<u n="709" who="S0405">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm as long as people don't then assume that that means that <pause dur="short"/> erm it's natural for men to go around having sex with lots of different women and <pause dur="short"/> women will have the instinct to try and find one man that's no one's I'm paraphrasing this argument <unclear/></u>
<u n="710" who="S0402" trans="overlap">well no I I'm also sure <pause dur="short"/> that like cave men <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> like just because one man would have sex with loads of women</u>

<u n="712" who="S0402">I'm pretty sure there would be some <unclear/> where a woman might have sex with <pause dur="short"/> many men</u>
<u n="713" who="S0405">right</u>
<u n="714" who="S0402">I I think just because the tribes are then kind of branched off like that <pause dur="short"/> that that could possibly be because of an imbalance of men to women because if you have if you have many more women than men</u>

<u n="912" who="S0555">it's like it's like if I got a picture of like <pause dur="short"/> I don't know it's like if I <pause dur="short"/> if I saw someone praying <pause dur="short"/> a Muslim prayer and I thought that's a cool dance move</u>

<u n="1323" who="S0405" trans="overlap">the reason I'm arguing that</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0555" trans="overlap">racism happens because there's a system behind it like <pause dur="short"/> like if someone seems someone and doesn't like them <pause dur="short"/> or like someone like if if someone sees me and I <trunc>lo</trunc> and I and I and they look and I like maybe try to steal something from a shop <pause dur="short"/> shop or I <trunc>li</trunc> I like look really and that's why that's why they follow me round the shop</u>

<u n="1326" who="S0555">that's not racist that's they have a reason</u>

<u n="1331" who="S0405">I get what you mean</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0555">but the thing is that that that that perpetuation does not exist for white people on the same level</u>

<u n="1334" who="S0555">there's no</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0405" trans="overlap">I agree it's not on the same level <pause dur="short"/> but if you look at it okay let's taking it a different path on a on a legal <pause dur="short"/> level you can be fined for inciting racial hatred</u>

<u n="1348" who="S0555">but the thing is I <trunc>do</trunc> it's <pause dur="short"/> racism as it's <trunc>e</trunc> as when white people talk about racism what they talk about is being rude to someone because maybe they're white it's not it's not the systematic abuse received received by a group of people because of a historical which has a historical basis and is perpetuated in modern culture</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0405" trans="overlap">okay <pause dur="short"/> alright I get what you're saying so</u>

<u n="1366" who="S0405">that that sexism has always happened to females and that's the reason we're in this society it's perpetuated and females are paid less and de de de therefore sexism against males is not part of that systematic system of sexism?</u>

<u n="1380" who="S0405">but neither was</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0555" trans="overlap">but like like you can't compare the two instances like erm <trunc>s</trunc> a woman saying that a man is sex driven <pause dur="short"/> that's not the same as a man calling a man calling I mean a man calling a woman a floozy like or like calling her a bitch cos you she won't sleep with him or something</u>

<u n="1399" who="S0402">that's not as a result of the system</u>

<u n="1401" who="S0405" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0555">is because <pause dur="short"/> of patriarchy patriarchy is what upholds sexism patriarchy also <trunc>dis</trunc> erm <pause dur="short"/> in some instances goes against some men for example men who are abused by their female partners aren't taken seriously because a patriarchy states that women <pause dur="short"/> are weaker than men men must be er like erm <pause dur="short"/> the dominant force in their relationship so to see a man be lowered in that way <pause dur="short"/> is not taken seriously because of patriarchy not because not because <pause dur="short"/> she that's sexist it's because of patriarchy that happens</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0405">why can't it be sexism though?</u>

<u n="1407" who="S0402">well <unclear/> sexism like erm</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0405" trans="overlap">because <pause dur="short"/> it's just discrimination against someone because of their sex</u>

<u n="1411" who="S0402">yeah</u>

<u n="1417" who="S0555">it is <trunc>se</trunc> it is it's sexist but it's not it's not it's not the same thing as saying <pause dur="short"/> it's sexism against men because it's still patriarchy which affects which is the same force that oppresses women <pause dur="short"/> so it's</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0405" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">right</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0402">yeah but it's not a moral standpoint it's sexist because discrimination is <unclear>out there</unclear></u>

<u n="1422" who="S0555" trans="overlap">no it it it it it stems from the same force as the sexism that women face <pause dur="short"/> as in it's it's because of the fact that men are considered to be <pause dur="short"/> superior to women which is why it's so it's so people see it as so demeaning or people feel so <trunc>demor</trunc> or people see it as so pathetic to see a man being abused by women that's because of the same <trunc>tho</trunc>those are the same reasons that women are are discriminated against because those those things are similar but I don't think that's different I don't think that's sexism against man men</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0402" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0405" trans="overlap">but then don't you think just because females <pause dur="short"/> tend to er er er be at a disadvantage more than men in those situations it's it's only important to consider the female side of it</u>

<u n="1429" who="S0402">okay</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0405">erm <pause dur="short"/> I'm trying to relate that to sexism but <pause dur="short"/> erm okay so let's let's say if that was sexism because they were not taken as seriously as a female who was <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0555">like men aren't allowed to talk about emotions and stuff like that</u>

<u n="1511" who="S0405">because most people only attach importance to erm female rights which I get <pause dur="short"/> yes the majority of you probably should but we need to tackle men's rights at the same time well not <trunc>ri</trunc> I wouldn't call them rights I'd say</u>

<u n="1514" who="S0555">the same things are being tackled cos they're tackled under the idea of gender <pause dur="short"/> that idea of whether that's why I asked you is there a difference between men and women because also that that's also within feminism those debates are in feminism</u>

<u n="1517" who="S0402">yeah but then <pause dur="short"/> if that was true then you'd have an equal proportion of men and woman <pause dur="short"/> as part of a feminist movement but you don't see that <pause dur="short"/> it it's <unclear/></u>
<event desc="unintelligible"/>
<u n="1518" who="S0405" trans="overlap">well it's harder for feminism feminism affects society far more than</u>
<u n="1519" who="S0555" trans="overlap">wait wait <pause dur="short"/> but it's harder to be a man</u>
<u n="1520" who="S0402">it's harder to be a man in a feminist group than a woman in a feminist group</u>
<u n="1521" who="S0555">well well <vocal desc="laugh"/> first of all</u>
<u n="1522" who="S0402" trans="overlap">wait wait wait if what you're saying is it should be just cos they're tackling the same problem in general they should be equal you should have an equal proportion of men and women in a feminist group but that's the the thing is it doesn't happen like that it doesn't work like that</u>
<u n="1523" who="S0555" trans="overlap">no well well the thing is feminism started as a group which opposed gender roles and it only contained women <pause dur="short"/> well it didn't only contain women but most of the members were women because of the fact that they were the oppressed group and they were involved in like for example when racism when people started when the civil rights movement happened most of the members were people of erm people who were of a minority ethnic group rather than white people but but the thing is like <pause dur="short"/> that doesn't damage anything they're still fighting for the same things <pause dur="short"/> just because they're women doesn't mean they can't and <pause dur="short"/> yeah I just don't understand that point it's like</u>
<u n="1524" who="S0402">so no right so if it was <pause dur="short"/> what you're saying is there's no need for men's rights groups because <pause dur="short"/> feminism</u>
<u n="1525" who="S0555" trans="overlap">because the same ideas are held within feminism</u>
<u n="1526" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah same ideas so then <pause dur="short"/> wouldn't it make by the same logic <pause dur="short"/> you should have a shit tonne of men in a in a feminist group because they find <unclear>he's like</unclear> so all the people that were in a</u>
<u n="1527" who="S0555" trans="overlap">yeah you <pause dur="short"/> yeah you should but like I don't know what example you're talking about is there a feminist conference that I am missing like right now that just has like only women?</u>
<u n="1528" who="S0402" trans="overlap">but then what why I know but <trunc>whene</trunc>whenever you <pause dur="short"/> the thing is that people talk about feminists <trunc>fe</trunc>feminism are all women there's no men talking about it <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="1529" who="S0555" trans="overlap">it's because men don't take it seriously cos they benefit from the system of perpetuation of of the patriarchy</u>
<u n="1530" who="S0402" trans="overlap">but you just said they didn't because because men's rights groups don't need us to fight the same thing</u>
<u n="1531" who="S0555" trans="overlap">no but the thing is sometimes they don't sometimes they do for example men benefit in the way that <pause dur="short"/> erm for example <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>pe</trunc> in <trunc>jo</trunc> in in jobs people for higher positions men are more likely to be selected <pause dur="short"/> or</u>
<u n="1532" who="S0554" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">or paid more</u>

<u n="1534" who="S0554">or paid more <pause dur="short"/> er like in the same role but paid more</u>
<u n="1535" who="S0555">yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah in the same yeah or being paid more yeah that benefits <pause dur="short"/> wait what was my point? <unclear/></u>
<u n="1536" who="S0554" trans="overlap">it benefits men</u>
<u n="1537" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="1538" who="S0554" whoConfidence="low">so they don't oppose to it</u>
<u n="1539" who="S0555" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah it benefits men but in other ways for example like emotional men are not allowed to discuss their emotions that that that's a way it it disadvantages men so <pause dur="short"/> there are ways that it benefits men there are also ways that it disadvantages men <pause dur="short"/> but but <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1540" who="S0405" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I suppose some people would argue that there's ways</u>

<u n="1554" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="1555" who="S0555">and the thing is that like <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing about feminism feminism is also like if you're a woman you have a right to choose if you follow the gender roles those shouldn't be enforced on you and that's the same thing with men you have the right to you have a right to choose to be hypermasculine but you also have a right not to be and be able to cry and whatever that's the thing people should have the right to choose and the thing is that people don't have the right to choose</u>
