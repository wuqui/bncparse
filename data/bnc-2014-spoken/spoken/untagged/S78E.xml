<u n="54" who="S0230"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="55" who="S0198"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0230" trans="overlap"><unclear/> she did manage to erm persuade them in the end with a bit of help <pause dur="short"/> from care managers and because they you see because they've always been in council</u>
<u n="57" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0230">they haven't got a lot of money they get all the help</u>
<u n="59" who="S0198">yeah I bet they do</u>
<u n="60" who="S0230">care managers and tenants allowance <pause dur="short"/> it's different there's look there's another lane filtering in from here</u>

<u n="62" who="S0230"><unclear/> <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0198">you are better off in <trunc>ca</trunc> not care but in</u>
<u n="64" who="S0230">not having any money when you're older?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0198">sometimes aren't you? I mean it depends there's a fine line</u>

<u n="67" who="S0198" trans="overlap">which is with everything in our society really isn't it? and there's that fine line between what is</u>
<u n="68" who="S0229"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="69" who="S0198">erm what's what gets you quite a lot of help from the government and then gets you none at all</u>
<u n="70" who="S0229">same <unclear/></u>
<u n="71" who="S0198">yeah it's the same brick again on that house</u>
<u n="72" who="S0230" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0198">which makes me wonder ah maybe it is council unless it's some more just private housing development</u>
<u n="74" who="S0230">yeah I mean I don't because they don't actually there's not a lot of council properties now they're all housing association</u>
<u n="75" who="S0229" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0198">oh right is that different then?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0230">yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0198">but the housing association provides government housing doesn't it?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0230">yeah cheap housing</u>
<u n="80" who="S0198">cheap housing yeah because it was on the news this morning wasn't it about <trunc>li</trunc> ah how much landlords are charging I think you've gone up to the shower mum and it was using <anon type="place"/> as an example</u>
<u n="81" who="S0230" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0198">and something called a half studio so not even a full studio flat but it's a studio it's they eh showed a picture it's a one room with your kitchen in there really small room and your shower is next to your kitchen and it's really tiny and it was in <anon type="place"/> for like eight hundred pounds a month</u>
<u n="83" who="S0229"><vocal desc="misc"/> just crawl out of the bed to get into the shower</u>
<u n="84" who="S0198" trans="overlap">and they were just saying that that now you they need to something needs to happen where they start regulating prices for landlords because it's just becoming ridiculous</u>
<u n="85" who="S0230">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0198">and people want you know there are some people slightly willing to pay but and apparently the argument is <trunc>i</trunc> well if you can afford eight hundred a month for rent then you can afford a mortgage but</u>
<u n="87" who="S0230">disabled use gate four</u>
<u n="88" who="S0229" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="89" who="S0198">problem is that</u>
<u n="90" who="S0229">oy <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0198">you need a massive deposit to have a mortgage up front don't you?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0230">of course you do don't you?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0198">so you need savings which people don't have</u>
<u n="94" who="S0230">yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0198">so it's just become they're saying that the housing association and what not need to step up and provide more cheap rented accommodation</u>
<u n="96" who="S0230" trans="overlap">accommodation yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0198">it doesn't have to be council or government just cheap affordable rentable accommodation because at the moment the landlords are running the lot</u>
<u n="98" who="S0230">but <trunc>un</trunc><trunc>a</trunc>accessible to all because at the moment the housing association you have to more or less sort of be unemployed and things like that to get <unclear>them sort</unclear></u>
<u n="99" who="S0198" trans="overlap">to even qualify anymore yeah because it's so in demand</u>
<u n="100" who="S0230" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0198">so yeah it just needs to be more yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0230" trans="overlap">or single parents</u>
<u n="103" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0230">they get it <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="105" who="S0198">it's just another problem altogether isn't it?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0230">mm <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="107" who="S0198">yeah there needs to be a separate bracket that's just affordable <trunc>a</trunc>accommodations</u>
<u n="108" who="S0230">I mean because you know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> really could do with a bigger property couldn't they?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0230">but they can't afford to rent on privately</u>
<u n="111" who="S0198">no it's a shame isn't it?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0230">they can't <trunc>af</trunc> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> doesn't earn enough money for a mortgage</u>
<u n="113" who="S0198"><trunc>s</trunc> I didn't realise they weren't in council housing</u>
<u n="114" who="S0230">oh didn't you?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0198" trans="overlap">it's <trunc>comple</trunc> I know they get I yeah I didn't I mean I yes I did because I realised when I thought I just I guess I hadn't thought about it before</u>
<u n="116" who="S0230">mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0198">but because they're in private that means they're not entitled to the same things are they when they get older?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0230">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0198">because they're not in council <unclear/></u>
<u n="120" who="S0230">no <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0198">but yeah <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> says he's seemed pretty set that he's going to probably stay there now though they'll move the girls into the bigger room they'll grow up there and then that'll do</u>
<u n="122" who="S0230">yeah</u>
<u n="123" who="S0198">seems such a shame though to spend your entire life renting a property</u>
<u n="124" who="S0230">mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0198">it just seems like such a waste of money</u>
<u n="126" who="S0230">mm well it is isn't it?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0198" trans="overlap">well I I feel like the eh at the end of so many years the landlord should be like oh okay then you've you've you've paid my mortgage now so you can have the property</u>
<u n="128" who="S0230">aw</u>
<u n="129" who="S0198">never will will they?</u>
<u n="130" who="S0230">no course they won't</u>
<u n="131" who="S0198">i'm not <trunc>pai</trunc> my <trunc>mor</trunc> but I mean they could already own the property</u>
<u n="132" who="S0230">oh yeah they probably could because they they they it's not just they don't just have that one house then his landlord</u>
<u n="133" who="S0198">no exactly</u>
<u n="134" who="S0230">they've got more than one house</u>
<u n="135" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0230">that they rent out</u>
<u n="137" who="S0198">most landlords do now don't they</u>
<u n="138" who="S0230" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0198">or a lot of them do make a business from it and even though a lot of them are bought up you know it's that when you and dad bought your houses when people started really buying their own property didn't they?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0230" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0198">which helped the boom you could get houses much much cheaper then <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure a lot of people have made a tidy profit from it <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="142" who="S0229"><unclear>jesus</unclear> they're all coming out of the thing see the mud up on some of them wheels</u>
<u n="143" who="S0198">they already finished do you reckon?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0229">well some come a couple of days before stay and then they go home and you'll see the mud look</u>
<u n="145" who="S0198">yeah that's true some could've come stayed last night couldn't they?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0229">had enough of it because of the wet weather and look it's going to go right up <unclear>there yet</unclear></u>
