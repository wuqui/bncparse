<u n="1" who="S0420">so this winter camping thing is a bit <pause dur="short"/> unorthodox isn't it? I mean it <trunc>d</trunc> it is is</u>
<u n="2" who="S0366">what?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0420">I mean you're not you're not the only people doing it</u>
<u n="4" who="S0366">well as far as I can see we are <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="5" who="S0420" trans="overlap"><trunc>real</trunc>really?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0366"><unclear>there's <trunc>u</trunc></unclear> nobody else up there</u>
<u n="7" who="S0420">oh god</u>
<u n="8" who="S0366"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="9" who="S0420">and the last time was up in Comrie was it?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0366">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> twice we've gone out form Comrie <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0420">but I mean are these spots where people would camp in the summer?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0366">no <pause dur="short"/> they're no they're not <trunc>si</trunc> you know</u>
<u n="13" who="S0420">no</u>
<u n="14" who="S0366">they're just out in the <unclear>hill land</unclear></u>
<u n="15" who="S0420" trans="overlap">no it's wild camping but are <trunc>th</trunc> are they?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0366">erm <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="17" who="S0420">are they places you would choose to camp in? in if you went there in the summer as well?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0366" trans="overlap">erm <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I suppose <pause dur="short"/> suppose we might</u>
<u n="19" who="S0365">the way we hit on them was that you've been going there since you were a kid</u>
<u n="20" who="S0366">mm mm</u>
<u n="21" who="S0365">and you'd known these spots like going for a walk with your dad</u>
<u n="22" who="S0366">mm mm</u>
<u n="23" who="S0365">and <pause dur="short"/> you knew that they would be relatively peaceful places</u>
<u n="24" who="S0420">mm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0365">picturesque <pause dur="short"/> and so <pause dur="short"/> that's how we just ended up setting off</u>
<u n="26" who="S0420"><unclear>really?</unclear></u>
<u n="27" who="S0365" trans="overlap"><unclear>to try and find</unclear> those places as targets</u>
<u n="28" who="S0366">and we tend to wait until it's really cold <pause dur="short"/> and dry so actually</u>
<u n="29" who="S0420" trans="overlap">so there'll be absolutely nobody there? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="30" who="S0366">well well it's more that erm <pause dur="short"/> you can go out as long you because then you keep dry <pause dur="short"/> if it's really <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> that's why we wait for the weather to drop temperature wise in many ways because <pause dur="short"/> once the ground's frozen underfoot <pause dur="short"/> we can go anywhere <pause dur="short"/> really whereas you know there's areas where that would've been very boggy <pause dur="short"/> if we if it hadn't been frozen</u>
<u n="31" who="S0365">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0366">so it makes walking</u>
<u n="33" who="S0365" trans="overlap">but it was very comfortable to walk on</u>
<u n="34" who="S0366">very easy and you never your boots don't get wet and <pause dur="short"/> it's erm <pause dur="short"/> it's it so that's partly why in the winter we wait for it to be cold</u>
<u n="35" who="S0420">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you know there's a book in this? <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="36" who="S0365"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0420">wild winter camping in Scotland I mean that's</u>
<u n="38" who="S0365" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> well <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure people have done it</u>
<u n="39" who="S0366"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="40" who="S0420">yeah and you could be taking erm you know these crazy Americans on <trunc>tour</trunc>tours and things like that</u>
<u n="41" who="S0365">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="42" who="S0366">actually we'll show you some pictures</u>
<u n="43" who="S0365" trans="overlap">oh that'll be nice</u>
<u n="44" who="S0366">we'll show you some pictures later after we've done this erm <pause dur="short"/> of some winter <pause dur="short"/> cos we were away this weekend but that wasn't camping</u>
<u n="45" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0366">erm</u>
<u n="47" who="S0365">but that's the ironic thing that we have just been to <pause dur="short"/> the Highlands which is a centre of er er kind of mountains around er Glen Coe and it was crowded <pause dur="short"/> but when we went to Comrie which is a village <pause dur="short"/> we left er Comrie High Street with people walking their dogs <pause dur="short"/> within half an hour we were in an area where we didn't see anybody <vocal desc="laugh"/> for the next sixteen hours</u>
<u n="48" who="S0366">uhu</u>
<u n="49" who="S0365" trans="overlap">so you know it was very peaceful</u>
<u n="50" who="S0420">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0365">so</u>
<u n="52" who="S0420">can imagine</u>
<u n="53" who="S0366">and then you've got you know there's places you try and go places where there's not too much light pollution so you can get the stars there was one camping trip we did at Corrour <pause dur="short"/> erm where we went up with for the Gemini meteor shower didn't we?</u>
<u n="54" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">uhu</u>
<u n="55" who="S0366">in December <pause dur="short"/> and erm <pause dur="short"/> we er <pause dur="short"/> there was very little light pollution so we just erm <pause dur="short"/> lay down in the tent with our heads outside on our boots and <pause dur="short"/> stared upwards and watched the meteor shower</u>
<u n="56" who="S0365">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0366"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="58" who="S0365">with a hip flask</u>
<u n="59" who="S0366">with a hip flask in my hand</u>
<u n="60" who="S0365" trans="overlap">to to keep us going</u>
<u n="61" who="S0366">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0365" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0420">added warmth</u>
<u n="64" who="S0366">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0420" trans="overlap">ah it sounds good</u>
<u n="66" who="S0366">yeah it was really good</u>
<u n="67" who="S0365">because there aren't many places here now where you can see the Milky Way</u>
<u n="68" who="S0420">no</u>
<u n="69" who="S0365">so</u>
<u n="70" who="S0420">you'd have to go very far north I'd imagine to get away</u>
<u n="71" who="S0365" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0420">from all the light pollution</u>
<u n="73" who="S0366">we would see them at erm Abernethy wouldn't we? right</u>
<u n="74" who="S0365">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0366" trans="overlap">like in the middle of the wood</u>
<u n="76" who="S0365">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0366">yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0365">and I'm sure you know when we were growing up <pause dur="short"/> the sky looked different and the <pause dur="short"/> you know even in the suburban area I grew up you wouldn't have to go that far to see a dark <pause dur="short"/> sky</u>
<u n="79" who="S0366">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0365">now it's so rare when you <unclear>see</unclear> the Milky Way <pause dur="short"/> it takes you by surprise</u>
<u n="81" who="S0420">yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0365" trans="overlap">that it's so clear</u>
<u n="83" who="S0420">but <trunc>a</trunc> er any any spot of darkness in a city is quite weird <pause dur="short"/> I I've been driving <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> cos this new job's in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0366">oh right</u>
<u n="85" who="S0420">erm you know <anon type="place"/> place?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0366">oh yes?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0420">er just off of er <anon type="place"/> street</u>
<u n="88" who="S0366">yes</u>
<u n="89" who="S0420" trans="overlap"><unclear>so</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> when I drive back I drive round <pause dur="short"/> by the Parliament and then <pause dur="short"/> arthur's Seat and it's it's <pause dur="short"/> it's really odd cos that that bit is just pitch black</u>
<u n="90" who="S0366">mm mm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0420">when you're driving up there in the dark and <pause dur="short"/> you forget you're in the middle of a city</u>
<u n="92" who="S0366">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0420">erm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0366">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0420">but of course that doesn't <unclear>help</unclear> the the light pollution cos</u>
<u n="96" who="S0365">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0420">it's wider <pause dur="short"/> but er <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0365" trans="overlap">the place we'd like to go to is <pause dur="short"/> er Kielder Forest in Northumberland</u>

<u n="105" who="S0420">just driving through</u>
<u n="106" who="S0365">right</u>
<u n="107" who="S0420"><unclear>in the woods and stuff</unclear></u>
<u n="108" who="S0365">was it an attractive area?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0420">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> they erm <pause dur="short"/> there was something on the radio about that <pause dur="short"/> place a few a few <trunc>m</trunc> weeks or months ago <pause dur="short"/> where they <pause dur="short"/> they were having a performance of <pause dur="short"/> recorded birdsong</u>
<u n="110" who="S0365">uhu</u>
<u n="111" who="S0420">but the the they'd they'd hooked up all these speakers <pause dur="short"/> and it was to do with what bird the the raven <pause dur="short"/> and they they'd recorded ravens <pause dur="short"/> and they they'd hook up all these speakers in the trees and they were inviting people to come and like know lie in the in the forest <pause dur="short"/> and they they said <trunc>absolute</trunc> the the <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>w</trunc> because of the speakers <pause dur="short"/> the way they were set up they would feel like a flock of ravens <pause dur="short"/> would fly in</u>
<u n="112" who="S0365">mm mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0420">settle <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>s</trunc> make whatever noise ravens make</u>
<u n="114" who="S0366" trans="overlap">huh</u>
<u n="115" who="S0420">and then fly off again <pause dur="short"/> er I never found out <trunc>h</trunc> what the results were like but <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said it was gonna be really spectacular with all these sound engineers and things like that</u>
<u n="116" who="S0366">oh</u>
<u n="117" who="S0420">and <unclear>setting it up</unclear> and RSPB erm <pause dur="short"/> sort of stuff but er</u>
<u n="118" who="S0365">I can imagine cos one of the most spectacular things I've seen <pause dur="short"/> in recent weeks in <pause dur="short"/> where I work at <anon type="place"/> there is a big tree <pause dur="short"/> outside <pause dur="short"/> and I left work one time at dusk <pause dur="short"/> and there were <trunc>n</trunc> tree was full of ravens</u>
<u n="119" who="S0420">mm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0365">landing or taking off or circling <pause dur="short"/> in dusk with you know a beautiful pink glow to the sky behind <pause dur="short"/> and I hadn't really gone anywhere I'd just left work and you expect to have to travel</u>
<u n="121" who="S0420" whoConfidence="low">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="122" who="S0365">into the wild to see things like that</u>
<u n="123" who="S0420" trans="overlap">what what do ravens look like exactly cos they're just they're very similar to crows and whatnot aren't they?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0365" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> to be honest I wouldn't've known <pause dur="short"/> the difference <pause dur="short"/> but a friend of mine who knows about birds</u>
<u n="125" who="S0420">oh <unclear>I see</unclear></u>
<u n="126" who="S0365" trans="overlap">said that they were ravens and that that they were ravens and that ravens stick together and crows are more solitary so</u>

<u n="128" who="S0365" trans="overlap">you can see flocks</u>
<u n="129" who="S0420">flock a flock of ravens yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0366" trans="overlap">oh I didn't know that</u>

<u n="136" who="S0366"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
