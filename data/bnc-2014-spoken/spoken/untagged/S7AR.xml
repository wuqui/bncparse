<u n="203" who="S0443"><vocal desc="misc"/> so she was er quite colourful underneath but she was just</u>
<u n="204" who="S0320"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="205" who="S0443">very quiet</u>
<u n="206" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="207" who="S0443">in public but a great sense of humour and she could <pause dur="short"/> get anyone to do anything for her</u>
<u n="208" who="S0320">well</u>
<u n="209" who="S0443">so there's the key to getting the people to do it for free I've done loads of it actually</u>
<u n="210" who="S0320" trans="overlap">that's what exactly what she did</u>
<u n="211" who="S0443">yeah</u>
<u n="212" who="S0320">she was really good <pause dur="short"/> I also know that she presented this year at the <anon type="place"/> conference in London</u>
<u n="213" who="S0443">right</u>
<u n="214" who="S0320">so I wouldn't be surprised if she twisted a few people's arms while she was out there as well</u>
<u n="215" who="S0443" trans="overlap">yeah that's about it that's what you do</u>
<u n="216" who="S0320">she was very good the the plenary speaker at the end of the day was very good he's called <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he's a big <pause dur="short"/> he's a big <pause dur="short"/> he's written all sorts about teaching and training and all sorts of things he was he was good actually <pause dur="short"/> he was talking about how you learn and how you remember <pause dur="short"/> stuff not only but stuff and what was he talking about? added a nice illustration while he was talking you have a lake of subconscious bubbling away</u>
<u n="217" who="S0443">mm</u>
<u n="218" who="S0320">and things whoosh up to the surface and you have a epiphany moment <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="219" who="S0443">oh okay</u>
<u n="220" who="S0320">and his example was his brother who's an English language teacher <pause dur="short"/> but they went off to <trunc>F</trunc>Spain for six months and he phoned <pause dur="short"/> his brother <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and saying I just I've learnt these phrases and then in order to remember the phrases I just go and use them over and over and over again and then I remember <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and he was saying <pause dur="short"/> his my brother's a language teacher and he's only just realised this is what you have to do <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="221" who="S0443"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="222" who="S0320">it's funny he wasn't saying anything new <pause dur="short"/> like not many of them are but I've noticed that <pause dur="short"/> they often don't say anything new but they have a slightly different slant <pause dur="short"/> and different words for the same thing</u>
<u n="223" who="S0443" trans="overlap">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> oh right</u>
<u n="224" who="S0320" trans="overlap">so he'd read some book that's not to do with languages at all</u>
<u n="225" who="S0443">right</u>
<u n="226" who="S0320">and erm <pause dur="short"/> has</u>
<u n="227" who="S0443">yeah</u>
<u n="228" who="S0320">come up with this whole presentation <pause dur="short"/> which was nothing new <pause dur="short"/> cos I've heard it all before</u>
<u n="229" who="S0443" trans="overlap">yeah that's true actually it's just getting a different slant on it to make it entertaining <unclear>it's got</unclear></u>
<u n="230" who="S0320" trans="overlap">very difficult to bring up anything new he's <trunc>g</trunc> a good speaker as well he's funny</u>
<u n="231" who="S0443">mm</u>
<u n="232" who="S0320">erm and he's <pause dur="short"/> yeah he's good he's interesting</u>
<u n="233" who="S0443">erm the opposite to this girl <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who was really quiet <pause dur="short"/> was the chair was a guy called <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who was an amazingly funny public speaker and very charismatic could get</u>
<u n="234" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm?</u>
<u n="235" who="S0443">you know? two hundred three hundred people <pause dur="short"/> total <trunc>i</trunc> entertained <pause dur="short"/> but he couldn't network for <trunc>co</trunc>toffee</u>
<u n="236" who="S0320"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="237" who="S0443">hated networking <pause dur="short"/> just couldn't do it</u>
<u n="238" who="S0320">how funny?</u>
<u n="239" who="S0443">so they were a funny pair they compensated very well for each other</u>
<u n="240" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="241" who="S0443">and she was obviously a pretty deadly <pause dur="short"/> networker to get everyone to do everything for free</u>
<u n="242" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="243" who="S0443">and he was the kind of the brains of it all</u>
<u n="244" who="S0320">yeah</u>
