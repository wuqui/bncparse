<u n="54" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0144">and she'd put some instruments up there</u>
<u n="56" who="S0024">okay that's dangerous though</u>
<u n="57" who="S0144">yeah which just sounds she was talking about guitars and stuff I was like well no guitars need to be people need to bring their own guitars you can't just pick up a guitar  cos it will just get fucked</u>
<u n="58" who="S0024">yeah no point in her buying <unclear/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0144">you can't have a communal guitar it'll just get ruined</u>
<u n="60" who="S0024">you'd have people <unclear/></u>

<u n="62" who="S0024">yeah</u>

<u n="65" who="S0144">I said maybe you can get maybe you can get a piano in there if she wants to pay for a piano but</u>
<u n="66" who="S0024">well what would you do without the cajón at <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="67" who="S0144">well I'd use my cajón <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0024">but you didn't have one at the beginning you never played a cajón before</u>
<u n="69" who="S0144">no</u>

<u n="74" who="S0024">they yeah they do have a lot of Chinese customers don't they?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0144">but do they wanna go and play music? I don't think so</u>

<u n="77" who="S0144">well that's what I was trying to say I was saying look we can play we're open to playing places but I don't think she wants to pay money for it</u>

<u n="80" who="S0024">yeah open mic nights</u>
<u n="81" who="S0144">but I said open mic night and she said no not really just any time morning afternoon evening anyone can go in and just jam and just play and pick up an instrument and play</u>
<u n="82" who="S0024">well that's nice cos it's a practice place</u>

<u n="87" who="S0144">mm</u>

<u n="91" who="S0144">yeah no cos they pay these Filipino guys to come in and play during the evening</u>
