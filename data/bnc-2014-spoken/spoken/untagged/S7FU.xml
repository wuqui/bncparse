<u n="54" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0144">and she'd put some instruments up there</u>
<u n="56" who="S0024">okay that's dangerous though</u>
<u n="57" who="S0144">yeah which just sounds she was talking about guitars and stuff I was like well no guitars need to be people need to bring their own guitars you can't just pick up a guitar  cos it will just get fucked</u>
<u n="58" who="S0024">yeah no point in her buying <unclear/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0144">you can't have a communal guitar it'll just get ruined</u>
<u n="60" who="S0024">you'd have people <unclear/></u>

<u n="62" who="S0024">yeah</u>

<u n="65" who="S0144">I said maybe you can get maybe you can get a piano in there if she wants to pay for a piano but</u>
<u n="66" who="S0024">well what would you do without the caj贸n at <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="67" who="S0144">well I'd use my caj贸n <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0024">but you didn't have one at the beginning you never played a caj贸n before</u>

<u n="74" who="S0024">they yeah they do have a lot of Chinese customers don't they?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0144">but do they wanna go and play music? I don't think so</u>

<u n="77" who="S0144">well that's what I was trying to say I was saying look we can play we're open to playing places but I don't think she wants to pay money for it</u>

<u n="80" who="S0024">yeah open mic nights</u>

<u n="87" who="S0144">mm</u>

<u n="91" who="S0144">yeah no cos they pay these Filipino guys to come in and play during the evening</u>
