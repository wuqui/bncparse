<u n="86" who="S0046">I know  I know  I said some hurtful things <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't mean that I meant them <pause dur="short"/> you know at the end of the day I was emotionally hurt too after what happened <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> so I said to I said some things that I probably didn't overly mean</u>
<u n="87" who="S0041">I think you've hit the nail on the head there <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> now bear that in mind <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> that for a girl to walk away <pause dur="short"/> so easy for a guy to walk away <pause dur="short"/> cut cut emotional ties like that</u>

<u n="100" who="S0041">girls are <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="101" who="S0084">typically</u>
<u n="102" who="S0041">well no but typically <pause dur="short"/> but girls typically aren't <pause dur="short"/> so if she's capable of doing that like she keeps pulling either one she's bullshitting so she can keep you on a lead and she's actually not gonna walk anywhere</u>
<u n="103" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0041">in which case please yourself cos she's not going anywhere</u>
<u n="105" who="S0046">mm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0041">or secondly she doesn't care for you at all <pause dur="short"/> cos girls just can't do that</u>
<u n="107" who="S0084">and I mean you've gotta remember that within moments of meeting her she'd said to you I wanna have a a kid</u>
<u n="108" who="S0046">mhm</u>

<u n="115" who="S0084">I'm not</u>
<u n="116" who="S0046">no I</u>
<u n="117" who="S0084">a conspiracy theorist but that that maths doesn't add up does it? Er you just seemed to be right guy a guy right time</u>

<u n="155" who="S0041">she's not where you want her now</u>
<u n="156" who="S0046">but if I take the stuff then she's more where I want her than when I not when I haven't got it</u>

<u n="593" who="S0084">chill out <pause dur="short"/> and it's really easy <pause dur="short"/> and it's I've become really comfortable <pause dur="short"/> and a few weeks ago when I had to go out for my work's do I was really on edge</u>
<u n="594" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="595" who="S0084">and I didn't like it <pause dur="short"/> and I was with my friend Rachel Rachel who I get on with really well <pause dur="short"/> but I was leaving all of the conversations to her</u>
<u n="596" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="597" who="S0084">so I was like her shadow</u>
<u n="598" who="S0046">mm</u>
<u n="599" who="S0084">basically</u>
<u n="600" who="S0041">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="601" who="S0084">and I was like God you're so boring <pause dur="short"/> like why don't you start a conversation with people? Everyone's looking at you like you're an idiot</u>
<u n="602" who="S0041">but when you're in that position</u>
<u n="603" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="604" who="S0041">you can't make yourself</u>
<u n="605" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="606" who="S0041">have a conversation <pause dur="short"/> whereas usually you'd be the</u>
<u n="607" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="608" who="S0041">chatterbox</u>
<u n="609" who="S0084">it was really and the more I thought about it the more I was like I just wanna get out of here <pause dur="short"/> I feel like everyone's staring at me</u>
<u n="610" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="611" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="612" who="S0084">and I didn't like it <pause dur="short"/> and obviously we left at like midnight or something</u>
<u n="613" who="S0041">feel really uncomfortable don't you</u>
<u n="614" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I just felt like you're a massive twat <pause dur="short"/> like no one likes you here <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>w</trunc> what are you doing? Now <unclear/> more interesting thing to say to anybody <pause dur="short"/> and once you're in that mindset you just can't</u>
<u n="615" who="S0041">screwed <pause dur="short"/> yep</u>
<u n="616" who="S0084">and so then then it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s birthday last week <pause dur="short"/> and I was like <trunc>w</trunc> I don't really it was late anyway wasn't it <pause dur="short"/> she <trunc>w</trunc> wanted me to go out like</u>
<u n="617" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="618" who="S0084">ten o'clock</u>
<u n="619" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="620" who="S0084">and the more I thought about it the more I thought I don't wanna go out and be around people actually <pause dur="short"/> I don't really want to go</u>
<u n="621" who="S0046">well it was just for a drink wasn't it?</u>
<u n="622" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos they went out for dinner <pause dur="short"/> and it would've been going out really late <pause dur="short"/> so um</u>
<u n="623" who="S0046">and going out just for a drink is hardly worth it is it</u>
<u n="624" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so it's just it's sort of been building for a little while <pause dur="short"/> and I guess I've always had that  I've always had that  I'm not the person in a crowd to er start conversation</u>
<u n="625" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="626" who="S0084">or I feel a bit on edge <pause dur="short"/> like I'm probably now the most confident that I've ever been <pause dur="short"/> but but I still feel nervous in social</u>
<u n="627" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="628" who="S0084">situations <pause dur="short"/> so I don't know if it's just</u>
<u n="629" who="S0046">you need a night out in a semi-lively pub I think <pause dur="short"/> not not like Regal lively <pause dur="short"/> I think just a late night</u>
<u n="630" who="S0041">I think you just need to</u>
<u n="631" who="S0084">I think I just</u>
<u n="632" who="S0041">force yourself to go out <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing</u>
<u n="633" who="S0084">er yeah</u>
<u n="634" who="S0041">Cos it's all in your head <pause dur="short"/> it's not in real life</u>
<u n="635" who="S0084">it's all in my head <pause dur="short"/> I think I just need to go out with people that I trust</u>
<u n="636" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="637" who="S0084">people that I know that you know aren't gonna judge me <pause dur="short"/> not people that I don't know very well</u>
<u n="638" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="639" who="S0084">even though those people probably aren't judging you</u>
<u n="640" who="S0046">what are they judging you on? That's what I don't get</u>
<u n="641" who="S0084">well in my head I just think</u>
<u n="642" who="S0046">there's nothing wrong with you <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="643" who="S0084">I just think God you're really you sound really boring <pause dur="short"/> or you're really uninteresting</u>
<u n="644" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="645" who="S0084">or you look a state</u>
<u n="646" who="S0041">when I come back from abroad <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> went through a hell of a time with me <pause dur="short"/> cos I came back <pause dur="short"/> went crazy for a couple of months</u>
<u n="647" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="648" who="S0041">and then I got an exact same thing <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't go anywhere <pause dur="short"/> and she was like what are you talking about? Like I was usually the person making everybody else go out</u>
<u n="649" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="650" who="S0041">and I just didn't go out for so long <pause dur="short"/> but then I felt like I was really old when I was going out <pause dur="short"/> cos the places that we</u>
<u n="651" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="652" who="S0041">used to go er cos all my friends</u>
<u n="653" who="S0046">they've all changed</u>
<u n="654" who="S0041">had graduated</u>
<u n="655" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="656" who="S0041">so just <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I and people that I just felt really old against <pause dur="short"/> and especially cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had a really tough time with me when I came back <pause dur="short"/> cos I was such a knob to her <pause dur="short"/> because I'd grown so much apart from her</u>
<u n="657" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="658" who="S0041">Cos I'd lived abroad for the year</u>
<u n="659" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="660" who="S0041">that I think I was just a bit up my own arse to be fair <pause dur="short"/> and but in my head I was like that when I was out</u>
<u n="661" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="662" who="S0041">I left all the talking to her</u>
<u n="663" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="664" who="S0041">all the time <pause dur="short"/> and whereas usually we'd be bouncing off each other or she'd be in my shadow more than anything else</u>
<u n="665" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="666" who="S0041">Cos we er we knew different friends <pause dur="short"/> so it was always a really good night for the pair of us to go out</u>
<u n="667" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="668" who="S0041">and I think maybe <trunc>th</trunc> ah I know what happened <pause dur="short"/> we went out maybe three or four times and I was panic attacking it up</u>
<u n="669" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="670" who="S0041">I was fine</u>
<u n="671" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="672" who="S0041">until we got in the club <pause dur="short"/> we paid the money <pause dur="short"/> I'd had a couple of drinks</u>
<u n="673" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="674" who="S0041">so the night's in full swing <pause dur="short"/> then I panic</u>
<u n="675" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="676" who="S0041">so I fucking ruin everybody's night because everyone's already out <pause dur="short"/> already in the club</u>
<u n="677" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="678" who="S0041">and then it was that kind of point where you're not quite drunk yet</u>
<u n="679" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="680" who="S0041">and you're that concerned you can't get to drunk</u>
<u n="681" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="682" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> and keeping yourself on edge</u>
<u n="683" who="S0041">so then everybody else is more drunk than you are</u>
<u n="684" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="685" who="S0041">then you're even more on edge <pause dur="short"/> the people looking at you</u>
<u n="686" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="687" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="688" who="S0041">and that you're standing out like a sore thumb</u>
<u n="689" who="S0046">that's why I came home early the other night</u>
<u n="690" who="S0041">standing round with you know with your arms crossed</u>
<u n="691" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="692" who="S0041">when you're not really trying to do that but then you're really awkward</u>
<u n="693" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="694" who="S0041">and the only reason it stopped is because my friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> came back to uni <pause dur="short"/> she had a lot of time off er with depression and anxiety <pause dur="short"/> she came back <pause dur="short"/> and we were out maybe the fourth or fifth time we were out <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> came with us <pause dur="short"/> and she had a panic attack</u>

<u n="3273" who="S0084">no they no that was on the cards for a long time apparently <pause dur="short"/> I think it must like cos he said he got out about two years ago <pause dur="short"/> and he was in for two and a half years <pause dur="short"/> so basically he and the missus like had a they thought they were gonna get back together <pause dur="short"/> shagged <pause dur="short"/> he found out she was pregnant <pause dur="short"/> he left <pause dur="short"/> or they'd broken up and then she said oh I'm pregnant <pause dur="short"/> and he didn't go back <pause dur="short"/> so they were never together when their last child was born <pause dur="short"/> and then all this happened about a year or so later</u>
<u n="3274" who="S0041">wowsers</u>

<u n="3278" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="3279" who="S0084">and he  and he  obviously does <pause dur="short"/> and you've got to make allowances for the type of person that he is</u>
