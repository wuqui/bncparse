<u n="1" who="S0618">yeah actually when I was erm <pause dur="short"/> actually a a few boyfriends ago <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> he was a really nice fella too nice actually erm his sister was married to a guy who worked for British Steel and lived in Thailand so we went out and stayed with them for a bit and had a bit of a tour of Thailand on holiday <pause dur="short"/> while we were there which was nice and erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah I remember we went to the British club and got a massage there and they tended to employ blind Thai people because the theory being that they are better at massage and the massage was amazing I had a <pause dur="short"/> probably a better one from a <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> a rather rotund Thai lady on a beach for about a tenth of the price as well erm <pause dur="short"/> but yeah <pause dur="short"/> so that was an eye-opener but you know the very fact they have this British club and these ex-pat er community gatherings and ex-pat events and <pause dur="short"/> yeah it didn't really dawn on me at the time but I think now being here every now and again on Facebook it flashes up about ex-pat blah blah blah and I think actually I think you mean immigrant <vocal desc="laugh"/> it just seems to have such negative connotations but I'm an immigrant and I think I will be an immigrant for the next few years actually whereevr I move in</u>
<u n="2" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so they are straight <pause dur="short"/> mm absolutely <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah and I was saying this to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> yesterday he was like oh I was reading up on you know Polish on the Polish mm political system at the moment <trunc>an</trunc> and I was gonna ask you about it and I was just like well <pause dur="short"/> you know from my point of view I don't want to be in the country anymore where immigrants aren't welcome because I'm an immigrant as much anybody else</u>
<u n="3" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="4" who="S0619">but I'm okay because I'm white because I'm here to sort of help the economy rather than hinder it in the sense that I'm helping you know Polish people do whatever it is and learn this necessary skill <pause dur="short"/> I don't want to be here if you know I'm <trunc>tar</trunc> not not tarred with the same brush that's not the thing that's not what I want to say but erm do you know what I mean it's like <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> why are you okay?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0619">yeah why am I okay? I don't want to be here if <trunc>immi</trunc> if immigrants aren't welcome then I don't feel welcome either</u>
<u n="7" who="S0618">and somebody from Syria for example isn't <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0619">erm and I've felt like that since this new government was sort of brought in I just think oh I'm not interested anymore so goodbye</u>
<u n="9" who="S0618">I think it was there before the new government it was there before the elections actually interestingly one of my students this week started on about the all these Syrian immigrants coming over here raping women and I heard that even before I moved to Poland about erm the perception of particularly Syrian refugees being rapists</u>
<u n="10" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm mm mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> it's not Syrian refugees it is <pause dur="short"/> well there's the <trunc>st</trunc> statistically it is erm migrants coming from North Africa erm <trunc>a</trunc> and <pause dur="short"/> I was listening to something on the radio about this last week and it's lots of different reasons why this is happening er one is that people are coming to the west and they're not being educated as to what is right and what is wrong in this society now that's not saying that well it's it's okay to do it in North Africa obviously it is not okay but erm here the repercussions you know in Germany and Scandinavia the repercussions will be much more serious erm so they are not being educated enough you know etiquette and manners and what is right and what is acceptable here er and it's to do with society and gender issues and all these things erm <pause dur="short"/> but it's not a Syrian refugee thing it's a North African migrant worker thing</u>
<u n="11" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> oh interesting according to my student this week it's Syrian Muslim refugees who are coming along and raping people</u>
<u n="12" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0618">erm it was also <pause dur="short"/> actually no it wasn't <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't Syrian specifically I'm thinking there was also a woman I did my CELTA  with erm a Polish woman and I stayed with her when I drove over here er before I got to <anon type="place"/> I stopped off with her she just lived outside of <anon type="place"/> and I had a bit of a disagreement with her as well erm for her it was refugee Muslim rapists and</u>
<u n="14" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> one of my students said this in my class as well and I said <vocal desc="laugh"/> in the class er this is not because of their religion or the colour of their skin or where they came from this is a man versus woman issue and it was like don't ever forget that these men fundamentally are rapists because they are men not because they are Muslim and he was like</u>
<u n="15" who="S0618"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0619">and I was like <trunc>r</trunc> look if you are gonna if you are playing with fire in my lessons</u>
<u n="17" who="S0618">yeah yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="18" who="S0619"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm just going to like pin everything on you</u>
<u n="19" who="S0618">are you sure you want to open that door? <vocal desc="laugh"/> come on walk on through it yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0619">so yeah horrible</u>
<u n="21" who="S0618" trans="overlap">but I also wonder you know how much of an issue is it? because the the general perception that I have from er the woman that I stayed with and from the student was that this is an enormous problem and that it's the majority that are raping people and I you know I don't believe that's the case for a minute and I said to her it's interesting I haven't heard half so much about that from er UK media I've seen a lot on UK media about people being welcomed in <anon type="place"/> particularly erm have erm local <anon type="place"/> organisations where immigrants refugees are welcomed and are helped to integrate into the community in Denmark I think it is Denmark one of the Scandinavian countries is desperate for young workers they are welcoming refugees with open arms to boost their worker economy so you know it just looks very much to me like the media in different countries for political ends decide to put a certain</u>
<u n="22" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> I think just you know <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> <pause dur="short"/> mm mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> focus on different things</u>
<u n="23" who="S0618">a certain focus on it</u>
<u n="24" who="S0619">erm so yet two things the first one I read a lovely article from work erm and it was about a er a woman in her thirties who needed a roommate or a flatmate erm and a refugee from Syria who needed somewhere to live er and er the state would pay the rent for him but it needed to be a private landlord and blah blah blah and so he moved in with her erm and you know her family were going well what about all of these you know all of these sexual assaults? and do you not feel threatened? and she was like oh god I didn't even that didn't even cross my mind I was worried whether it would mean that I would have to drink less alcohol in case he was offended or whether you know he would be offended if I was eating like bacon on a Saturday morning</u>
<u n="25" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> don't offer him a game of cards at Christmas</u>
<u n="26" who="S0619">yeah you know erm so and it <pause dur="short"/> this is they've been living together for a few months now erm and about their sort of relationships he's learning English and he's er helping around the house and putting up shelves and all of these things erm and on Halloween she went dressed as Jeremy Corbyn and he went dressed as David Cameron with you know like a Conservative rosette and erm you know quotes attributed to David Cameron sort of pinned to his body and there's this picture and she's you know white-faced with huge rings around her eyes and grey hair er you know and there's</u>
<u n="27" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> that's scary <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> oh my goodness <pause dur="short"/> that's some cultural integration for this guy</u>
<u n="28" who="S0619">yeah and he's gone to er he's gone to he went to her family's house for <pause dur="short"/> for Christmas and she lived near the coast and you know he just had such a lovely time erm and you know he ate the turkey er even though it was halal because you know it's been blessed because it's a you know it was a Christmas dinner so the food has been blessed maybe if it's blessed by somebody it's you know it's okay for me to eat</u>
<u n="29" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's interesting</u>
<u n="30" who="S0619">so it was just really a lovely read</u>
<u n="31" who="S0618">yeah I I guess <trunc>wh</trunc> what sort of strikes me about that story is you are talking about two individual human beings with their labels stripped away you are not talking Christian or Muslim or male or female or Syrian or North African or English or anything you are talking about two human beings who you know find they have plenty in common</u>
<u n="32" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm mm mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> have been brought together and they're you know having quite a nice time of it</u>
<u n="33" who="S0618">yeah yeah that's lovely</u>
<u n="34" who="S0619">yeah I will try and find it and send it to you but it was really just a nice thing to read</u>
<u n="35" who="S0618">mm I think the bottom line for me is people are people and I think all humans wherever they are want the best for themselves and for their family and first and foremost that means a safe place to live where you are warm you are comfortable you know you've got shelter you've got food you've got community you've got relationships you know you feel part of something bigger than yourself perhaps be that family or community or whatever and <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean there's so much that divides people and it is really is divide and conquer as far as I'm concerned while people are still fighting each other and poor are fighting poor in the <unclear>world</unclear> and not focusing on more things</u>
<u n="36" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> I don't want living here and like my main problem with this sort of racial racial problem is is how can people here feel so strongly about this potential threat when there isn't even a threat? no refugees want to come here because they know they won't be welcome and there's the economy is not strong enough for them to get a job erm how can you feel so strongly against you know someone if you've never met anyone from a different culture?</u>
<u n="37" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah I know <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> he's a person that you don't know</u>
<u n="38" who="S0619">how can you feel so strongly against Muslims as a whole if you've never met anyone who is not like you white? I just don't get it it just doesn't even like register in my brain I just don't understand how you can have these sort of preconceptions like so er <vocal desc="sigh"/> and be so easily influenced by what you read in the newspapers or what the government tell you to think how can you even think like that without being questioned?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0618">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it does not compute <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I suppose that <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I agree <vocal desc="laugh"/> it does seem to be you know quite a big issue here</u>
<u n="40" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0618">of mainstream media manipulation</u>
<u n="42" who="S0619">but at the same time the people who voted for this political party and this party who have got the majority vote the <trunc>v</trunc> the voters are people who I never encounter they are older very religious people and I never meet old religious people here I don't teach them like you know? I don't talk to them</u>
<u n="43" who="S0618">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> are they? have you asked your students did you vote for them? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="44" who="S0619">no but I think that's the like the the voter is that person</u>
<u n="45" who="S0618">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay because you see I thought the same about when Cameron got in again I thought holy shit I don't know anybody who's voted for this arse</u>
<u n="46" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="47" who="S0618">and I'd expressed that when I had a trip to England actually it was before Christmas it was before <pause dur="short"/> oh no it was when I was on my way to Poland actually it was September last year and I was saying I have no idea who votes for these people and then my brother said actually I did and my niece said oh and I did because my father did and then my uncle said well I did and my aunt said well I did and I said I don't know you people</u>
<u n="48" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah that's <pause dur="short"/> I know you get I was so surprised when this government got in because it was like everyone that I interact with <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0618">yeah yeah abhors everything that Cameron stands for</u>
<u n="50" who="S0619">yeah absolutely it was <pause dur="short"/> er and it is because I mean you know I was selective with who I'm friends with on Facebook and Twitter so I just have it in my mind that absolutely everyone</u>
<u n="51" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <trunc>no</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> yeah nobody voted for them</u>
<u n="52" who="S0619"><vocal desc="laugh"/> thinks the same politically and socially as me</u>
<u n="53" who="S0618">I know it really pulled me up short</u>
<u n="54" who="S0619">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0618">and then you go oh bloody hell no they don't it is just that I've just handpicked this group of friends to be around and we all have a similar interests but the rest of the you know the country isn't like that I was like how weird is that? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> who are very much like you <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I know I know you could have knocked me down with a feather I just thought my god we share the same blood I'm related to you I can't believe this so</u>
<u n="57" who="S0619"><vocal desc="laugh"/> you just think <pause dur="short"/> you know and what you think is is true isn't you think god I was <vocal desc="laugh"/> so wrong yeah there's a wider world there's a wider world out there than you certainly than your own sort of friendship group I suppose</u>
<u n="58" who="S0618">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so I think we've done quite well to get away from Cameron and his policies just leave the country so job done <vocal desc="laugh"/> this is where we have ended up <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0619">it's a lot worse <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0618">yeah to an immigrant and refugee-hating country instead so <pause dur="short"/> oh well try Spain <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="61" who="S0619">I don't know I just think wherever you are gonna encounter these problems and as bad as <pause dur="short"/> er England is and as bad as Cameron is it's not as bad as the government here who are doing everything they can to change the constitution without agreement from anybody yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> and so is Cameron if you look at the <unclear>tip</unclear> legislation but anyway that's a whole other barrel of fish slippery eels</u>
<u n="63" who="S0619">slippery eels</u>
<u n="64" who="S0618">yeah I do wonder though historically or if we sort of look back on this time of I suppose for me Thatcher and Reagan were the beginning of the end they were the epitome of everything that sucks they kick-started the sort of neoliberal capitalism that's brought the world to its knees really but I do wonder if you need a certain amount of that selfishness before the rest of the world goes hang on a minute <vocal desc="laugh"/> this really isn't right and I look at Corbyn coming through now who seems like I don't think we've seen a politician like him since possibly John Smith who I think was probably murdered and then also erm you have got that fella in the States Bill Sanders who has basically said erm you know I can win an election but I'm not going to change anything it is up to you all the people to stand up and fight for what you believe in erm I can do what I can to take the corruption out of politics and to start changing the system from within but it is down to you take some fucking responsibility and I wonder if Corbyn is going to be a little bit like that as well so I do wonder <pause dur="short"/> and actually I suppose if you look back at the end of the eighties and the collapse of communism it is almost like it needs to get as bad as it can possibly get erm and that that sort of that particular branch of communism got as bad as it could possibly get and then it just crumbled erm in no time and I was talking with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> about this the other day</u>
<u n="65" who="S0619">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm mm <pause dur="short"/> mm mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> we need to rebuild it</u>
<u n="66" who="S0618">yeah I do wonder if you know this particular form of capitalism and this particular form of ho ho democracy has reached as bad as it's gonna get and it's just gonna fall in the coming years maybe five years come in ten years will it last that long? but I do think sort of economically socially and environmentally the world is on its knees now something has got to give <pause dur="short"/> it is interesting</u>
<u n="67" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it is really er <pause dur="short"/> quite frightening I suppose</u>
<u n="68" who="S0618">I find it exciting rather than frightening</u>
<u n="69" who="S0619">I think it's took over <pause dur="short"/> do you?</u>
<u n="70" who="S0618">yeah I do I think it's an amazing time to be alive</u>
<u n="71" who="S0619" trans="overlap">it can only get better <pause dur="short"/> yeah but I suppose every every lifetime is a great time to be alive I don't think this is any better or any worse than any other time</u>
<u n="72" who="S0618">yeah I guess so <pause dur="short"/> I suppose there's sort of peaks of activity I just can't help but feel that there's a sort of a you know a world regime that's geared towards economic outcomes with the environment and society being sacrificed and that seems to be the theme of the moment and the theme of the last thirty years or more but when that collapses and that shifts I don't know it just seems like a momentous thing I do see humanity becoming more loving and more open and I wonder in a way if the refugee issue is getting people to address their own prejudices and to start thinking in terms of human as humans rather than religion</u>
<u n="73" who="S0619">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah if it really stares you in the face you've got to address it in some way</u>
<u n="74" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0619">even it means unlearning everything that you know</u>
<u n="76" who="S0618">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah exactly it's tackling belief systems</u>
<u n="77" who="S0619">mm yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0618">a lot of which particularly in this country people would have been brought up with with a very heavy church influence heavy influence of dogma I do come back to a lot I do think organised religion has a huge amount to answer for in the world that we see today</u>
<u n="79" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah well when I was talking to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> yesterday he's he's got the impression that after <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> goes to England next week she might start planning to move erm <pause dur="short"/> she just needs to sort of take the this first step of going and seeing how she gets on because I mean he's he's got the impression that she's she doesn't want to be part of this she can't find her place in Polish society because she doesn't sort of agree with so much of it</u>
<u n="80" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> I can understand that</u>
<u n="81" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0618">yeah <pause dur="short"/> she hasn't expressed that so overtly to me but reading between the lines I could see how that could well be the case I think she's particularly excited about this job which you can potentially do from any country</u>
<u n="83" who="S0619" trans="overlap">no she hasn't to me <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah exactly</u>
<u n="84" who="S0618">I think it it sounds like it is not very well paid so she might want to reconsider going to England <vocal desc="laugh"/> so maybe live in a country where she doesn't need so much money for rent and food</u>
<u n="85" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no I don't think it would be a full-time thing and she will always earn you know she can speak three languages completely fluently like there will be opportunities for her and <pause dur="short"/> as sad as it is I suppose <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who moved last year she's working in The Body Shop and she's probably earning way more in The Body Shop than she was working as a teacher in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0618">that's true <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah I'm sure</u>
<u n="87" who="S0619">so</u>
<u n="88" who="S0618">I think the Polish teachers of English don't get paid even as much as the natives</u>
<u n="89" who="S0619">twenty twenty-five</u>
<u n="90" who="S0618">Jesus</u>
<u n="91" who="S0619">my friends last year they were it was their first year teaching at <anon type="place"/> and they got twenty an hour or twenty for forty-five minutes</u>
<u n="92" who="S0618">wow <pause dur="short"/> this is Polish people?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0619">mm yeah because it was their first year and if you are teaching kids in elementary and your language level is lower you don't get so much whereas if you are up there teaching like proficiency and CAE you get paid more because you've got to have a better level of English but you've got to work through the system and it always make I always question like why <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she's stuck to teaching like pre-intermediate and why she should be teaching like the top I suppose it's just like years those years that you are in the company I guess and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> has been teaching for fifteen years so she teaches proficiency</u>
<u n="94" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> a different level <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> why <pause dur="short"/>mm maybe she enjoys it I don't know <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> wow I suppose if you are happy</u>
<u n="95" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0618">and you don't aspire to earn more you don't need to earn more you love what you do it doesn't matter</u>
<u n="97" who="S0619">and the lower levels you teach the earlier that you finish whereas when you teach the highest levels you finish later</u>
<u n="98" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah half eight or whatever yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0619">yeah and if you have got a family or you just want your own time then</u>
<u n="100" who="S0618">yeah oh I keep meaning to ask you I've given all of my students notice that I'm stopping teaching at the end of February do you want my private students? sixty up to an hour forty-five for forty-five minutes</u>
<u n="101" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah do you have to do any sort of real preparation?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0618">no</u>
<u n="103" who="S0619">or just chat?</u>
<u n="104" who="S0618">chat</u>
<u n="105" who="S0619">do you plan anything that you are going to do?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0618">a little bit erm I've got erm <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has erm English file upper intermediate second edition and <anon type="place"/> is on third edition but I've got second edition PDFs and I could email you those <pause dur="short"/> erm he's liked well for his first few lessons he liked to work out of the book and I told him straight off don't oscillate about grammar talk to your Polish teacher about that don't ask a native so he was fine with that but we tended to as the time went on use the book really as ideas for topics but now that we have got to know each other a bit better the last couple of lessons we haven't even looked at the book so I've had the PDFs open at the right page the teachers book and student book ready to use if he wants to but he hasn't wanted to so I've just been kind of following his lead <pause dur="short"/> all I do for all of my students is I've got a sheet of A4 divided into three sections which is erm the first section is error corrections so I will write down things where I don't want to interrupt their flow and bring them up at the end of the lesson and they correct them <pause dur="short"/> the next section is new vocab so if we come across something like I don't know probably an idiom or something like that er the rat is deserting a sinking ship whatever it might be I'll write that down what the meaning means if it's come up in conversation and the final section is erm pronunciation and we go through the pronunciation and I get them to write next to it how it sounds to them</u>
<u n="107" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah</u>

<u n="109" who="S0619">phonetics oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="110" who="S0618">yeah but others just write it as they'll remember it and understand it and they take that sheet away with them so all I'm doing throughout the lesson is on the spot correction if it feels appropriate if it doesn't feel appropriate just note note it for later it's easy it's easy money</u>
<u n="111" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah no it is easy <pause dur="short"/> yeah I used to do it in three sections which would be error correction pronunciation and then the third one was things I like that you have said</u>
<u n="112" who="S0618">hey that's cool</u>
<u n="113" who="S0619">but I really liked it when you said this</u>
<u n="114" who="S0618">that's a good idea</u>
