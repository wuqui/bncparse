<u n="117" who="S0043">oh right so it lasts that oh you've got it for that long</u>
<u n="118" who="S0158">oh yeah well <pause dur="short"/> the deal  The deal  probably is that we'll stop going after we've been going for about twelve or thirteen years</u>

<u n="123" who="S0043">oh right</u>
<u n="124" who="S0158">whereas if you cling on to it after that</u>
<u n="125" who="S0043">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0158">then at the end of thirty years</u>
<u n="127" who="S0043">A lifetime</u>

<u n="159" who="S0158">the food <pause dur="short"/> well it's not so bad <pause dur="short"/> I mean the for vegetarians France isn't that brilliant <pause dur="short"/> all the time <pause dur="short"/> but I just like the countryside and the vast quantities of alcohol at very reasonable prices</u>
<u n="160" who="S0043"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
