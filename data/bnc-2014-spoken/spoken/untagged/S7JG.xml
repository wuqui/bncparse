<u n="15" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah she does</u>
<u n="16" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's cos it's probably cos she's never moved out <pause dur="short"/> and so she's never grown up more than eighteen</u>

<u n="27" who="S0041" trans="overlap">I was like seriously? And she was like yeah I know I said tell me about it she said no really <pause dur="short"/> I was like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> how much money do you think I earn? </u>
<u n="28" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0041">she was like well you know a bit a little bit more than me and I was like yeah a hundred pound she was like well there you go then <pause dur="short"/> I was like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I doubt very much that your rent's like mine she says I do pay rent <pause dur="short"/> I said yes and I doubt very much it's five hundred pound a month <pause dur="short"/> </u>

<u n="33" who="S0041">so she yeah she's she's comparing two hundred pounds to my five hundred <pause dur="short"/> I mean in some months it's four five five so still works out weekly so actually it's not five hundred pounds it's four five five</u>
<u n="34" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah but still <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but still so much</u>
<u n="35" who="S0041" trans="overlap">I was just like what? And I was like</u>
<u n="36" who="S0084" trans="overlap">I can't believe she charges you twenty quid a week more than she charges me</u>
<u n="37" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0084">for a room</u>
<u n="39" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0084">only just bigger than mine <pause dur="short"/> think it's just absolutely outrageous <pause dur="short"/> I think she definitely put the rates up when we moved in</u>
<u n="41" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0084">she just <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> doesn't really live in the real world so she's no idea how much rent costs</u>
<u n="43" who="S0041" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> no and she was like</u>
<u n="44" who="S0084" trans="overlap">Cos she doesn't need to</u>

<u n="46" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0041"> and I pay for transport and I pay the car insurance <pause dur="short"/> And I said well this month with the car fiasco that was fun <pause dur="short"/> and the whole time I mean I didn't I wasn't I wasn't saying it to have a dig I was saying it so that she kind of understood that really her situation isn't that bad</u>
<u n="48" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0041">D'you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0084">absolutely</u>

<u n="53" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0084">she's a nice girl but it must be difficult to be friends with someone like that because you are so different</u>
<u n="55" who="S0041">it's just craziness <pause dur="short"/> like I don't I didn't expect her to go oh yeah poor you </u>
<u n="56" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="57" who="S0041">I expected her to maybe appreciate that having her mum like that</u>
<u n="58" who="S0084">yeah she's lucky to have that</u>
<u n="59" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and stop being so rude to her</u>
<u n="60" who="S0084" trans="overlap">to be able to to say yeah to not take her for granted and to appreciate what she's got</u>
<u n="61" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0084">well that's the thing cos you would think that having spoken to you know once or twice about your family situation the thought would've occurred actually d'you know I haven't had half as much drama with my family as I've as <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s had with hers maybe I should be a bit more grateful about what I've got going on at home whereas people like her you tend to find that they're just as selfish because</u>

<u n="64" who="S0084">they um they just see it see their problems they don't see other people's problems <pause dur="short"/> they don't see that what they've got actually is quite a good situation</u>
