<u n="1057" who="S0193">watch Rastamouse</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0192">some people would argue that there aren't really any languages as such there are just dialects there there's a famous quote that a language is merely a dialect with a navy and an army</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0193">mm</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0192">and that's it</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0193">that sounds interesting</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0192" trans="overlap">that's all it is yeah but er</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0199" trans="overlap">what does that mean?</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0192">it's called a language because I'm of a different country to you and therefore I'm speaking a different language to you for example in in parts of Pakistan and in India one language is Urdu the other language is Hindi it's the same language it's exactly the same but one has a different alphabet to the other but it's the same they call it a different language cos they're different countries and therefore they don't speak the same language they speak different languages</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah cos it's all <trunc>d</trunc></u>
<u n="1066" who="S0199">ah right yes yeah</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0192">so a language</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0199" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0192">is a dialect with borders and</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0193" trans="overlap">it's all to do with who's who's in charge who's got the power and who says what</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0192">but erm what defines a language what defines if we're speaking the same language is what's called mutual intelligibility can I understand you?</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0199">mm mm</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0192">if I can understand you then we're speaking the same language and you can actually trace on a map of Europe you can start you know at England and if you go from here to say Frisian in like Dutch we can kind of understand them a bit and then if you take them to Dutch they'll understand each other and Dutch to German they'll understand each other German to Austrian you can keep following that line and you can trace it right across Europe where along that line</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0199" trans="overlap">because English is the</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0192" trans="overlap">they'll understand each other but if they're not right next to each other they won't understand each other</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0193" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0192">and you can see how the dialect changes</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0193" trans="overlap">is English the main language throughout the world?</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0192">do you mean the most spoken language or?</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah I mean the most erm spoken around the world</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0192">not</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0193" trans="overlap">as in</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0192">not in first</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0193" trans="overlap">or is it French?</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0192" trans="overlap">not as a first language erm Mandarin is the biggest language Chinese</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0193" trans="overlap">Mandarin?</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0193">is it?</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0192"><trunc>spoke</trunc> it's got the most speakers in the world cos they have like nearly two billion people in er you've almost got a third of the world in their country</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0193">oh</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0192">but as as second languages go yes English is the most</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0193" trans="overlap">English is</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0192">spoken as a second language like for people learning</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0193" trans="overlap">and is that because</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0199" trans="overlap">to communicate</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0192">another language as a</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0193" trans="overlap">and is that just because years and years ago we owned or?</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0192" trans="overlap">we colonised yeah</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0192">we <trunc>coloni</trunc> and we still continue to colonise today I mean Cambridge University <trunc>P</trunc> goes around making exams and you know universities have to take these exams to go and study in other places and you you know English is the language of commerce and business and therefore Chinese are learning English and other people are learning it's a form of <trunc>colo</trunc> <trunc>colo</trunc> colonialism isn't it really? it hasn't really changed pretty much it's just more <trunc>op</trunc> it's more covert it's not so obvious it's like kind of hidden</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0193" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0192">and unfortunately to a certain degree I'm part of that because I'm teaching English er the way I see it is I think it's a good thing for everything</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0193" trans="overlap">well yeah you're you're an Englishman you was teakening teaken teaching English</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0192" trans="overlap">teaching English yeah</u>

<u n="1108" who="S0199" trans="overlap">you're instilling English into them</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah however I don't think it's a bad thing for everyone to share a language I don't think we should lose language I think you should keep your culture and retain your own language</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0193" trans="overlap">I don't think there's anything to feel bad about you're an Englishman</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but I think</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0193">who's grown up and learnt er er and been educated and you're using what you know best with what you can do</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0192">mm</u>

<u n="1122" who="S0192">are where the oil is mm</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0192">I feel a bit bad on that front you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so you're going off to Saudi?</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0192">it's where the better jobs are and they've hit erm the teaching English scene is really burgeoning and proliferating in Kazakhstan nowadays and this kind of area</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0193" trans="overlap">what's profitherlating mean?</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0192" trans="overlap">proliferating burgeoning same thing erm developing lots more is happening</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0193" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0192">like it's growing around that area</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0192">so like erm Kazakhstan is really up-and-coming and they're starting to pay more because they've hit oil there they're finding a lot of oil around that area so effectively the English teachers are following where they're finding oil because you find oil and then the local people get wealthy and then they want more wealth so they wanna be a part of the you know</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0193">so they build houses</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0192" trans="overlap">the business and then they start</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0193" trans="overlap">they build extra things they build</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and they start learning English and doing this kind of stuff so it's just part of my job I don't wanna stay as an English teacher forever</u>

<u n="1138" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah that's good it's a good job</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0193" trans="overlap">that's a good one a lot of people go there don't they?</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0192">yeah it's slightly more liberal than Saudi as well but it's also harder to get a job there I probably already have to have experience working in the Middle East to be able to go there so therefore I need to go to a lesser country first to be able to go but er Dubai</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0193" trans="overlap">how safe is it?</u>

<u n="1144" who="S0192">and there'll be armed guards around the compound and all that kind of stuff so I mean <pause dur="short"/> it's safe enough there's good jobs in Iraq if you considered going there and northern Iraq but it's not the safest part of the world so I might not</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0192">Turkey's pretty good Turkey pays quite well Europe really doesn't pay very well for English teachers at all because they just have so many of them</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so Saudi's the best because of the of the fact that they're</u>

<u n="1209" who="S0193">really so that pays that well?</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0192">the pay isn't that great like in Korea</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0193" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0192">I was on about fourteen thousand pounds that was all I was on but because they cover my rent and bills were covered in my last job and the cost of living's low</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so that's your money</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0192">I could save about seven hundred pound a month</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0192" trans="overlap">every every month Saudi pays about twenty thousand twenty to twenty-five thousand pounds a year and again rent's covered and bills are covered so you can save about fifteen hundred pounds a month in Saudi Arabia so</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0192">in one year I could save like fifteen thousand pounds and that's not gonna happen anywhere else I mean you'd need to be on like forty fifty-sixty K in England to save fifteen hundred pound a <trunc>mon</trunc></u>
<u n="1219" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so are you doing your masters now?</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0193">which will then give you what? opportunity of what? lecture?</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0192">I can teach at universities in in the Middle East so <pause dur="short"/> I'll probably still have to teach the English language for another year maybe two years I don't have to I could potentially get a job teaching academic writing so I could go on and teach composition so then</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0193" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0192">I'm preparing students to go to</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0193" trans="overlap">well you like that don't you?</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0193" trans="overlap">you're good at that</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0192">so basically what you're doing then is getting students up to the level where they can go and study in America or study in England</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0192">because they're at a good enough academic level where their writing is good enough</u>
<u n="1231" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1232" who="S0192">and so I'm at teaching English that will move to academic writing</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and then eventually it'll move to teaching linguistics and then I'm teaching others er probably somewhere in the middle will be teaching others how to teach English so there'll be people that want to teach English and I'm teaching them how to teach English</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0193">so</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and then the final step will be teaching linguistics itself in a European university but to do that I need a PhD</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0192">so</u>
<u n="1239" who="S0199">that's what <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s doing at the moment a PhD</u>
<u n="1240" who="S0192" trans="overlap">that's another bunch of years so you know what I mean? I to be able to fund a PhD I need to be able to have enough money to live on for four years that's a lot of time you know what I mean? <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I would need to save at least thirty thousand pounds each so that's the plan we go back to the Middle East we save fifteen grand each and we travel Africa and do another qualification we do a Delta that would cover that year <pause dur="short"/> we go back and do two more years and save thirty grand each and that will be enough for us for us to do a PhD</u>
<u n="1241" who="S0193" trans="overlap">well when you when you say go back go back where?</u>
<u n="1242" who="S0192">well at that point if we already had experience in Saudi then we'd probably try and get I mean Kazakhstan as I said is doing quite well so we might end up going to Kazakhstan or we'd go to Dubai or Bahrain or somewhere a little more liberal but it's still in the</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0193"><anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s son came back from Dubai he was working for the government out there</u>

<u n="1245" who="S0193">and he said too dangerous now and he's come back to England</u>
<u n="1246" who="S0192">yeah I mean they're not the safest of places</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0193">mm</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0192">we wouldn't be able to travel that easily there</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0193" trans="overlap">the military he said</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0192">but</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0193">the military gave him advice to get out when <unclear/></u>
<u n="1252" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it's closer to England I'd only be a five to seven-hour flight from England so it would be closer</u>
<u n="1253" who="S0193">mm</u>
<u n="1254" who="S0192">I can travel Africa and the Middle East which is what we wanna do so it's just a much better reason</u>
<u n="1255" who="S0193" trans="overlap">apart from the Middle East stuff are there no other countries you prefer to er teach in? it alway it seems to be the Middle East stuff</u>
<u n="1256" who="S0192" trans="overlap">okay well this is the this is the problem with my field where you actually want to go where the <trunc>f</trunc> life is fun and all like er you're having a good time the pay is really poor for example I'd love to teach in er Latin America I'd love to live in Argentina or Chile or somewhere for a <trunc>fe</trunc> Mexico the pay in Mexico I'd be on about five hundred dollars a month <pause dur="short"/> five hundred dollars I mean it's about three hundred pounds a month</u>
<u n="1257" who="S0193">a month yeah</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0192" trans="overlap">that's nothing you <trunc>ca</trunc> I mean Mexico is not that cheap I'd be on nothing because they have so many volunteer teachers from America</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0193" trans="overlap">and what about in this country?</u>
<u n="1260" who="S0192">they don't need to pay people very much and erm in Argentina</u>
<u n="1261" who="S0193" trans="overlap">well what would you be paid in this country?</u>
<u n="1262" who="S0192">right now with my qualifications I could be about twenty-five grand erm teaching ESL in a college or something like that I could do that now</u>
<u n="1263" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1264" who="S0192">but</u>
<u n="1265" who="S0193" trans="overlap">and the lifestyle for you is boring</u>
<u n="1266" who="S0192">I couldn't save very much on twenty-five grand really</u>
<u n="1267" who="S0199">no because of the cost of living</u>
<u n="1268" who="S0192">the cost of living here I could I could save</u>
<u n="1269" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah but hang on there'd be <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is</u>
<u n="1270" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but maybe four hundred three hundred a month</u>
<u n="1271" who="S0193" trans="overlap">is <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> at the same level as you?</u>
<u n="1272" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="1273" who="S0192">yeah we have exactly the same qualifications</u>
<u n="1274" who="S0193">so you'd have twenty-five grand coming in that's fifty grand between you</u>
<u n="1275" who="S0192">yes but twenty percent is tax ten percent is National Insurance I whack on another ten percent in my student loans then you've got council tax then you've got you know all sorts of taxes on top you end up paying fifty percent in tax before you've ever done anything VAT twenty percent of every single thing you buy it just it's not cost-effective I can earn and save better money elsewhere now once I have my PhD I can get a job as a lecturer and I get forty thousand pounds a year so that's the only <trunc>ti</trunc> that's the kind of bracket that I need to be on</u>
<u n="1276" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so you're over here in Brighton for a year to do your masters</u>
<u n="1277" who="S0192">yeah</u>

<u n="1288" who="S0192">so</u>
<u n="1289" who="S0193" trans="overlap">for money</u>
<u n="1290" who="S0192">year doing a masters year in the Middle East year in Africa two more years in the Middle East</u>
<u n="1291" who="S0193" trans="overlap">hold it Africa we've got to what's that? Africa</u>
<u n="1292" who="S0192">travelling Africa</u>
<u n="1293" who="S0193" trans="overlap">travelling leisure time</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and also I'll do a well it'll probably be a bit more than a year because I'll need to do another three-month teaching qualification</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0193" trans="overlap">I'd love to go there</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0192">which is Delta</u>

<u n="1298" who="S0192" trans="overlap">come out and join us</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0193">you'd probably want to stay in Africa</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0192">yeah I may well do I mean who knows?</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0193">yeah it'll be brilliant</u>
<u n="1302" who="S0192">who knows? erm so this plan may change</u>
<u n="1303" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so are you so it's from from the Middle East to Africa that sounds a nice better place</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah then but that's not to work I'll do a qualification</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0193" trans="overlap">that's leisure</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0192">for three months while I'm there and then I'll travel for a year so I'll be there for probably about a year and a half it's very <trunc>li</trunc> possible if we're doing well enough in our field that I could get involved in some creole research while I'm out you know in Nigeria or Cameroon or somewhere random like that I don't know</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0193">do you speak French?</u>
<u n="1308" who="S0192">no but I'm gonna learn it while I'm living in the Middle East so that I can it's it's absolutely necessary</u>
<u n="1309" who="S0193">Africa innit mm</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0192" trans="overlap">to like to travel there erm so let's say I continue on that plan I go back somewhere that pays well for example of the Middle East most jobs in the Middle East that are good are on a two-year contract which is why I'm gonna have to take not such a good job because I don't wanna work for two years I've already got itchy feet and I've just</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0193" trans="overlap">why why well if you liked Africa do you think you would stay living out in Africa?</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0192" trans="overlap">there's no money there there's no money I wouldn't get paid there nothing I'd have to most jobs are volunteering so I can volunteer and do some research and have my board covered but</u>
<u n="1313" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so the this the the schools or colleges or whatever they have out there will be pittance money?</u>
<u n="1314" who="S0192">yeah there's nothing there there's no money erm China's coming on there's a lot more investment there like some British universities are teaming up with Chinese universities so in general Chinese universities</u>
<u n="1315" who="S0193" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0192">only pay about six hundred pound a month which isn't a lot but if you go and work for one of these combination unis then you'll get about twelve hundred pounds a month or thirteen hundred pounds a month but there's not many of these yet but a lot of people in my field are saying that China's just gonna keep going up</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and the pay's gonna keep going up</u>
<u n="1319" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1320" who="S0192">so it's possible we could go back and work there at some point so masters Middle East Africa</u>
<u n="1321" who="S0193">and then China I reckon</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0192" trans="overlap">two more years somewhere that pays well then I should have enough to do a PhD and then a PhD takes four years so I'm already got ten years</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so you definitely want to do your PhD?</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0192">yeah and we're probably gonna apply to do our PhD in America or Canada somewhere or Australia somewhere</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0193" trans="overlap">oh you've got lived in America have you?</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no somewhere because as well you've got more chance of getting funding</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0192">if you're a foreign student than if you're not <pause dur="short"/> so if I go in as a foreign student in in America or somewhere then I mean potentially I don't need to save all that money but I'm going to anyway because maybe I do need to and I'll apply to do a PhD but the problem is you don't know if you get funding until you get accepted so you apply to a PhD you get accepted and then you apply for funding</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0193">so when do you get the professor title?</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0192" trans="overlap">so I'll have to apply to loads of so once I have a PhD</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0193">oh</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and I'm teaching at a university I'm already a professor in some countries the the what makes a professor changes in Korea anyone that works at a university is a <foreign lang="kor">gyosu</foreign> which is different to a <foreign lang="kor">seonsaeng</foreign> <foreign lang="kor">seonsaeng</foreign> is teacher <foreign lang="kor">gyosu</foreign> is professor the translation is professor so in English they called me professor but in England you'd never be a professor with the qualifications I have</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0193" trans="overlap">no cos the standard is higher</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0192">no <pause dur="short"/> in fact in England you're a lecturer when you have a</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so what would you be here in?</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0192" trans="overlap"><trunc>ye</trunc> I I to be a professor</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0193" trans="overlap">you'd be a lecturer here now?</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0192">no no no I can't even work at university not even with an MA maybe with an MA if I taught ESL if I taught English teaching English as a foreign language with enough experience and with a masters you can teach at a uni but if I wanted to teach for example there are two courses running close together in my uni one is an ELT course English Language Teaching and when I look at all the lecturers there only three out of ten have their doctorate the other seven just have masters and lots of experience however on the course I'm doing all the <event desc="sound of scraping"/> have a PhD you have to to do linguistics but they're still not professors in England you need to have been a lecturer for years and then you become a senior lecturer and then after that you become a professor however in America as soon as you're teaching at a uni you're a professor so it's the what makes a professor is different in different countries</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0193">yeah and it's larger America isn't it? it's</u>
<u n="1340" who="S0192" trans="overlap">so in England I wouldn't be a professor until I'm like fifty I'd have to get a job at a uni and I'm like forty and</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah and your hair would be long and you'd have a big forehead and a brain and you'd be like in tweeds</u>

<u n="1352" who="S0192">yeah I admired all my professors and decided that's what I wanted to be and that's what I wanted to do I enjoy teaching it's the problem <trunc>i</trunc> probably <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I may never live in England permanently</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0193">mm</u>

<u n="1428" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and the responsibility I had I I had to to completely grade them I had to observe them I had to make up the exams for the classes I had to it was nice to have yeah I had to write the exams and then mark the exams and do speaking exams as well as written exams so I give I'm giving them a grade that goes towards</u>

<u n="1432" who="S0192">you know what I mean? in English but I wasn't teaching the majors in English I was teaching all majors so I actually had a lot of engineering students <pause dur="short"/> so still some of the students didn't really wanna learn English <trunc>b</trunc> but they had to</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1434" who="S0192">part of their degree meant that they had to do it so once I had my MA then I can move into teaching English students they're there to study English</u>
<u n="1435" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="1436" who="S0192">and then they'll be much better behaved and they'll be much better students but actually it was</u>
<u n="1437" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so did you find that hard then the <trunc>tea</trunc> the kids that didn't wanna really learn?</u>
<u n="1438" who="S0192">it's a challenge yeah I mean my last</u>
<u n="1439" who="S0193" trans="overlap">cos it is as a teacher isn't it?</u>
<u n="1440" who="S0192">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1441" who="S0193" trans="overlap">to get the kids interested</u>
<u n="1442" who="S0192">mm definitely</u>
<u n="1443" who="S0193">is the first bit isn't it?</u>
<u n="1444" who="S0192">I think a very important part</u>
<u n="1445" who="S0193" trans="overlap">at all</u>
<u n="1446" who="S0192">is to hold no grudges against them whatsoever I had a girl in my last er one of my hardest classes I had to teach was a their major was music and and <trunc>dra</trunc> er music and art they had no interest in English whatsoever none and I had this girl in my first class of the semester and I went just to see how she was getting on and she did this to me as if to say go away</u>
<u n="1447" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1448" who="S0192">you know what I mean? I'm not interested and</u>
<u n="1449" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1450" who="S0192" trans="overlap">most I told my colleagues and they'd all all they were like I'd hate that person I just blah blah blah I think if you take how a student reacts personally you're not gonna be a very good teacher</u>
<u n="1451" who="S0193" trans="overlap">you can't no</u>
<u n="1452" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and you're not gonna take it well I didn't I made an effort to</u>
<u n="1453" who="S0193" trans="overlap">you have to</u>
<u n="1454" who="S0192" trans="overlap">to make some kind of connection with her and to get her to understand</u>
<u n="1455" who="S0193" trans="overlap">cos you're the teacher and you're there to</u>
<u n="1456" who="S0192">and I tell you what by the end of the class she was friendly with me and she liked me</u>
<u n="1457" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1458" who="S0192">and she she did better than she would have done I think had I neglected her</u>
<u n="1459" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1460" who="S0192">in the class erm I don't take any of it personally</u>
<u n="1461" who="S0193" trans="overlap">because you always gotta think you don't know what these kids</u>
<u n="1462" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="1463" who="S0193">what's going on outside</u>
<u n="1464" who="S0192">exactly</u>
<u n="1465" who="S0193">or in their personal life</u>
<u n="1466" who="S0192">and I I actually think it's quite important perhaps to have teachers</u>
<u n="1467" who="S0193" trans="overlap">and it's a very responsible position being a teacher</u>
<u n="1468" who="S0192" trans="overlap">that weren't necessarily good students I wasn't a very good student at school so I can look at those people and say you know what? when I was in your position I didn't wanna be here either</u>
<u n="1469" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="1470" who="S0192">so I understand where you're coming from and I can empathise with that</u>
<u n="1471" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1472" who="S0192">I think that's an important attribute for a teacher but</u>
<u n="1473" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="1474" who="S0193">er er yeah absolutely yeah</u>
<u n="1475" who="S0192">so erm I'm looking forward to teaching people that definitely do wanna do that but I I really enjoy being at the uni way more than I enjoy being in the public schools because they really didn't wanna learn you'd get a few students that would always help you out and they'd always volunteer answers and stuff but</u>
<u n="1476" who="S0193" trans="overlap">and it just makes your job like so</u>
<u n="1477" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but the majority yeah were difficult</u>
<u n="1478" who="S0193" trans="overlap">why am I here?</u>
<u n="1479" who="S0192">you'd spend you know</u>
<u n="1480" who="S0193">and what's it like where you are now?</u>

<u n="1487" who="S0193">what?</u>
<u n="1488" who="S0192">I mean my reading list per I'm doing four modules at the minute and every week they sent me homework each module and if you <trunc>ha</trunc> and it's <trunc>rea</trunc> you have a set of homework which for me is language analysis I have to analyse I'd was just analysing German and I was analysing Cameroonian pidgin in my last class</u>
<u n="1489" who="S0199">jeez</u>
<u n="1490" who="S0192">if you haven't done that when you come to the seminar well you haven't got anything to contribute</u>
<u n="1491" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1492" who="S0192">so you can't talk about it but each module of those four sets me probably assigns ten books a week that you have to read you don't read the whole book but they'll be like here's ten books read chapter one and two of this book</u>
<u n="1493" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1494" who="S0192">read read chapter four of that book read chapter</u>
<u n="1495" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1496" who="S0192">so you're reading about forty chapters a week which is probably about four books a week</u>
<u n="1497" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1498" who="S0192">I've got to get through about four books</u>
<u n="1499" who="S0193">yeah feeding your brain all the while aren't you?</u>

<u n="1503" who="S0193">well what are the other students like? are they similar ages or all ages?</u>
<u n="1504" who="S0192">it's quite a young crowd actually</u>
<u n="1505" who="S0193" trans="overlap">backgrounds or</u>
<u n="1506" who="S0192">out of twelve of us on the course there's only three that are British erm two are Saudi one's Polish one's Russian one is er</u>
<u n="1507" who="S0193" trans="overlap">you went to Russia didn't you?</u>
<u n="1508" who="S0192">no no I haven't I've been</u>

<u n="1513" who="S0193" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="1514" who="S0192">I haven't been to Russia no I've been very close I went to northern China and it was Russian there were a lot of Russian people around and a lot of Russian culture because it was only about a hundred miles from the border with Russia but it <trunc>w</trunc> it wasn't Russia I haven't actually been to Russia it's really hard to go to Russia</u>
<u n="1515" who="S0193">mm</u>
<u n="1516" who="S0192" trans="overlap">they're very very very strict on their visa</u>
<u n="1517" who="S0193">the iron curtain as they used to call it</u>
<u n="1518" who="S0192" trans="overlap">visa policy <pause dur="short"/> you only get a one-month visa to go <trunc>th</trunc> you can only go there for a month and to get that month you have to tell them exactly where you're going and exactly where you're staying you have to have everything booked and planned and you have to have been approved by the government and</u>
<u n="1519" who="S0193" trans="overlap">not like here it's just yeah come in come over we'll house you and do your operation</u>
<u n="1520" who="S0192">basically</u>
<u n="1521" who="S0193">I know but then</u>
<u n="1522" who="S0192" trans="overlap">so then</u>
<u n="1523" who="S0193" trans="overlap">we're in a pretty safe country</u>
<u n="1524" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1525" who="S0193">haven't got too much to worry about</u>
<u n="1526" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm it's got one of the highest crime rates in the world England it's in the top fifty out of three hundred countries in the world for you know crime rates</u>
<u n="1527" who="S0193">mm</u>
<u n="1528" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I think it's fairly safe here there's no civil war or anything like that you know what I mean? but</u>
<u n="1529" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah I'm on about wars not the crimes</u>
<u n="1530" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but the crime rate's quite high</u>
<u n="1531" who="S0193" trans="overlap">that's due you know</u>
<u n="1532" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but it depends how you judge crime rates cos I mean</u>
<u n="1533" who="S0193" trans="overlap">that's the police force innit?</u>
<u n="1534" who="S0192" trans="overlap">Korea has one of the lowest crime rates in the world but the reason is that a lot of the crimes that happen they don't consider crimes they just overlook it</u>
<u n="1535" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1536" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it would be a crime in England but it</u>
<u n="1537" who="S0193">so it wouldn't be reported would it?</u>
<u n="1538" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no cos like for example</u>
<u n="1539" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so what I stabbed my dad he upset me? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1540" who="S0192">no not not not quite to that degree but like</u>
<u n="1541" who="S0193"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1542" who="S0192">like traffic their laws they don't seem to have any laws on the road they just go they drive through red lights if they want to and all that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="1543" who="S0199" trans="overlap">they're mental aren't they?</u>
<u n="1544" who="S0192">there there's just no the <trunc>prob</trunc> the problem is there's a hierarchical culture and all the police are really young so if you're old a young policeman can't tell you what to do because he's younger than you so if a young policeman pulls an old man older like of of some kind of high status and says you know you were speeding he'd laugh at them and just drive off cos they're younger than him they're they're not so they <trunc>do</trunc> so those crimes aren't reported as being crimes</u>
<u n="1545" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so the older you get the easier you get off with stuff</u>
<u n="1546" who="S0192">mm you also become a scapegoat though I don't know if you heard about that boat sinking</u>
<u n="1547" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1548" who="S0192">in Korea killed like three hundred people</u>
<u n="1549" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1550" who="S0192">they completely blamed it on this the</u>
<u n="1551" who="S0193">were you over there when it happened?</u>
<u n="1552" who="S0192">oh yeah yeah it just happened not far off the coast to where I used to live it was probably about thirty miles off the coast it was terrible three hundred children died</u>
<u n="1553" who="S0193">yeah I know</u>
<u n="1554" who="S0192">you know why they died?</u>
<u n="1555" who="S0199">did they leave the</u>
<u n="1556" who="S0192" trans="overlap">partly cultural it's an obedience thing they listened to their elders this is what I'm talking about this hierarchical thing and the the boat captain told them to stay still <pause dur="short"/> and they did and nobody moved</u>
<u n="1557" who="S0193" trans="overlap">even to the point where they were sinking</u>
<u n="1558" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and this they there was them just staying there for an hour</u>
<u n="1559" who="S0199" trans="overlap">oh my god</u>
<u n="1560" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and then about forty-five minutes in the boat tilted and the boat tipped so imagine you were in the floor and now you're on the walls and you can't get out so they had all the boats there to rescue them and they could see the children inside but they couldn't get them out</u>
<u n="1561" who="S0199">oh my god</u>
<u n="1562" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and the boat just sunk yeah it's terrible and that they completely blamed the ship captain and he committed suicide and a bunch of other people committed suicide over it they lost face the the head the <trunc>princ</trunc> the vice principal of the school hung himself outside the outside the school like it's terrible</u>
<u n="1563" who="S0199">oh my god</u>
<u n="1564" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it was really horrific and we were there it was really bad it's a bit of a cultural problem it's like if somebody above you says do this personally I I think the teachers were mostly to blame not him</u>
<u n="1565" who="S0193">yeah was gonna say what about the people looking after the kids' safety?</u>
<u n="1566" who="S0192" trans="overlap">the the captain didn't know exactly what was going on exactly exactly and what about the</u>
<u n="1567" who="S0193" trans="overlap">what were they doing? going stay there?</u>
<u n="1568" who="S0192" trans="overlap">what about the children themself? they weren't young they were like middle schoolers and</u>
<u n="1569" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1570" who="S0192">and er so they should have been going hang on a minute I'm on a boat there's a problem isn't the safest place on deck where I can potentially jump off? no they some of them got in cupboards I don't know what they thought was going on but they climbed into cupboards and were like texting their parents saying you know there's something wrong we don't know what it is but it's okay I'm safe I'm in a cupboard <pause dur="short"/> it's like well</u>
<u n="1571" who="S0199">oh gosh</u>
<u n="1572" who="S0192">it was horrific</u>
<u n="1573" who="S0193">uneducated it's uneducation</u>
<u n="1574" who="S0192" trans="overlap">pretty much all of pretty much all of the adults got off</u>
<u n="1575" who="S0199">oh</u>
<u n="1576" who="S0192">and the captain got off as well but the problem is that by the time it the <trunc>bo</trunc> the boat just suddenly tilted and then you couldn't get them off</u>
<u n="1577" who="S0193" trans="overlap">so where were the kids? below deck?</u>
<u n="1578" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="1579" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah they were all inside and they were all told to stay inside so they stayed inside and then</u>
<u n="1580" who="S0193" trans="overlap">well what happened to man woman and <trunc>chil</trunc> women and children first?</u>
<u n="1581" who="S0192">well they weren't evacuating at this point they didn't know the boat was sinking they the <trunc>prob</trunc> there was a whole load of things they they'd adapted the boat they piled on a load more weight onto the boat the boat should have been decommissioned ten years before but hadn't been</u>
<u n="1582" who="S0199">jeez</u>
<u n="1583" who="S0192">there was all sorts of things that hadn't happened it was just a series of bad events</u>
<u n="1584" who="S0193">mm</u>
<u n="1585" who="S0192">but the adults that were on board</u>
<u n="1586" who="S0193">so there was no safe there was no health and safety in there at all</u>
<u n="1587" who="S0192" trans="overlap">once they heard a bang no they all went they all went out onto the deck so that when the boat started to tilt they were ready to jump off</u>
<u n="1588" who="S0199" trans="overlap">they could get off yeah</u>
<u n="1589" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and they did so all the adults just</u>
<u n="1590" who="S0193" trans="overlap">and nobody went to rescue the kids?</u>
<u n="1591" who="S0192" trans="overlap">they couldn't get them out the boat was can you imagine? like there's the exit how do I get to the door?</u>
<u n="1592" who="S0193" trans="overlap">oh right yeah and they're down yeah</u>
<u n="1593" who="S0192" trans="overlap">you know what I mean? the door's above me you they couldn't get out it's terrible because there's pictures of</u>

<u n="1602" who="S0193">so nothing's been learned from it?</u>
<u n="1603" who="S0192">I wouldn't have died though I'd have got off the boat and swum and the thing is in Korea you're never far from land they were no more than two hundred metres from land</u>

<u n="2221" who="S0192">and I wanna know what they say <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> when we're talking together when me and mummy are talking or mummy and other people are talking other adults how much do you understand?</u>
<u n="2222" who="S0191">nothing</u>
<u n="2223" who="S0192" trans="overlap">do you understand a hundred percent do you understand fifty percent does he understand percentages?</u>
<u n="2224" who="S0199">do you understand all of it or half of it or a little bit of it or nothing?</u>
<u n="2225" who="S0191">half of it</u>
<u n="2226" who="S0192">half of it</u>
<u n="2227" who="S0199" trans="overlap">half of it</u>
<u n="2228" who="S0192">so when we're talking you only understand half?</u>
<u n="2229" who="S0191">yeah</u>
<u n="2230" who="S0192">yeah?</u>
<u n="2231" who="S0199" trans="overlap">do you listen to it all or do you just kind of listen to some of it?</u>
<u n="2232" who="S0191" trans="overlap">awesome</u>
<u n="2233" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2234" who="S0199">I I don't think you listen to it all do you?</u>
<u n="2235" who="S0192">I wanna find out what children think what how much they actually understand</u>
<u n="2236" who="S0199">it's amazing how much they take in</u>
<u n="2237" who="S0192">oh yeah definitely I'm learning all about erm cognitive science at the minute learning about language faculty erm and how children acquire language and how there are sets of <trunc>paramet</trunc> they believe the the model is that there's erm principles and parameters theory for example in English we have what's called head specific language where that means complements go after the head so for example in the sentence I eat pizza in the bath yeah?</u>
<u n="2238" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="2239" who="S0192">just as a random sentence I eat so eat the complement to eat would be pizza in the bath the complement to pizza with be in the bath the complement to in would be the bath if you know what I mean the complement to the would be bath there it's head first which means that the complements come after the word but there are languages that would say I eat bath the in pizza it's the other way round</u>
<u n="2240" who="S0199">really?</u>
<u n="2241" who="S0192">yeah they're called head final languages Korean is head final language</u>
<u n="2242" who="S0191">awesome</u>
<u n="2243" who="S0192">so they found that there's parameters and they basically</u>
<u n="2244" who="S0191" trans="overlap">awesome it's staying there</u>
<u n="2245" who="S0192">that we have the capacity in our brain our brain has a model for language already and all they cos originally behaviourists believed that children learn from positive and negative things that they listened and and they heard stuff</u>
<u n="2246" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="2247" who="S0192">but Noam Chomsky in the sixties turned around and said how is that possible when children can say things that they've never heard before? they can use constructions that and how is it that a child can hear us say things incorrectly yet doesn't repeat it? they don't there basically they believe that there's a framework underlying the language and all the child has to do is decide is it head first or is it head last? is it null subject or does it have a so I am gonna explain null subject in English we say I speak <pause dur="short"/> we have to say I</u>
<u n="2248" who="S0191">awesome</u>
<u n="2249" who="S0192">with the speak we can't just say speak I we have to say I speak English not speak English but in Spanish they don't they just say <foreign lang="spa">hablo ingles</foreign> which would be I speak English not <foreign lang="spa">yo hablo ingles</foreign> so English is called a non-null subject language and Spanish is an er is a null subject language so they believe that children just set the parameters they listen and they go I need to say the the who it is in this language so then they say it and they structure the language that way that's what I'm studying not in syntax I'm studying the underlying structure of language and how the variation between languages and there's all sorts of parameters</u>
<u n="2250" who="S0199">oh my goodness</u>
<u n="2251" who="S0192">for example another one when we make a question erm</u>
<u n="2252" who="S0199">you know what you sorry go on</u>
<u n="2253" who="S0192">for example the sentence what do you eat? the original sentence is actually you do eat what? but then the inversion process causes the do auxiliary to come first what do you eat? not you do eat what? what so the what moves to the beginning the do moves but certain languages don't move the what phrase that stays at the end so in English we have a head first W H operator in Chinese they don't it stays in the same place so the child just has to learn those switches learn whether we move those W H questions to the front or we keep them in place do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="2254" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="2255" who="S0192">so they think that it's called poverty of stimulus is the argument that there's no way that children have heard enough to be able to use as much language as they're using therefore they must already have the language and they just have to put the words of the language in</u>
<u n="2256" who="S0199">goodness</u>
<u n="2257" who="S0192">it's quite a crazy theory that they've been building on since the sixties and it's it's completely revolutionised a lot of fields about language er acquisition and how we do all this kind of stuff</u>
<u n="2258" who="S0199">you know what you said about erm not correcting them?</u>
<u n="2259" who="S0191">oh my god</u>
<u n="2260" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2261" who="S0199">because they correct themselves</u>
<u n="2262" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2263" who="S0199">I've been trying to not do that but er I can't remember like er what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will drop</u>
<u n="2264" who="S0192" trans="overlap">don't not correct him</u>
<u n="2265" who="S0199">no <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will drop like letters out of his words and things and I cannot</u>
<u n="2266" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="2267" who="S0199">not correct him because and what I've been see I did it what I've been saying to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is when he's said the words I'm like now spell that to me <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> how do you spell it?</u>
<u n="2268" who="S0192">that's a little bit different I understand what you're saying but we're confusing two slightly different things</u>
<u n="2269" who="S0199" trans="overlap">like Mar-in</u>
<u n="2270" who="S0192">yeah we're confusing two different things though when I said that children don't learn from negative reinforcement I'm talking about grammar not about pronunciation</u>
<u n="2271" who="S0199">right</u>
<u n="2272" who="S0192">pronunciation you've got a problem with Mar-in because the elite standard says that you must pronounce the T Martin</u>
<u n="2273" who="S0199">but how do children learn to spell if they don't know how to say it properly?</u>
<u n="2274" who="S0192">well spelling and and pronunciation is arbitrary anyway how do you learn to spell the word enough even though it ends in a G H? you just learn it by rote process of doing it</u>
<u n="2275" who="S0199">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2276" who="S0192">however what they're arguing is that children don't learn like if it's grammar so when he says I broked it even if you said no it's broken er I broke it</u>
<u n="2277" who="S0199">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2278" who="S0192">that doesn't matter he will learn that anyway</u>
<u n="2279" who="S0199">right okay</u>
<u n="2280" who="S0192">so it's not pronunciation</u>
<u n="2281" who="S0199">so it's not right</u>
<u n="2282" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it's grammar</u>
<u n="2283" who="S0199">okay</u>
<u n="2284" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it's grammar pronunciation if you want him to speak what you would consider to be properly then yes you do need to reinforce that</u>
<u n="2285" who="S0199">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2286" who="S0192">because you're trying to make him a set way</u>
<u n="2287" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="2288" who="S0192">but most languages in English follow the same grammar we all say I speak you speak he speaks so if he say he speak and you say no <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> it's he speaks then he'll ignore you and just whatever he'll get it</u>
<u n="2289" who="S0199">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2290" who="S0192">he'll get it himself regardless</u>
<u n="2291" who="S0199">I have stopped doing that I've just answered him with the right</u>
<u n="2292" who="S0192">the right</u>
<u n="2293" who="S0199">way of saying it</u>
<u n="2294" who="S0192" trans="overlap">the right yeah you can do that</u>
<u n="2295" who="S0199">but <pause dur="short"/> but I've have been trying to like with</u>
<u n="2296" who="S0192"><pause dur="short"/> you say it as well <trunc>bu</trunc></u>
<u n="2297" who="S0199">I know I know I do I mean you know</u>
<u n="2298" who="S0192" trans="overlap">that's fine there's no problem with that</u>
<u n="2299" who="S0199">you know but with him like I did with you and with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I'm still picking up on ending his Ts and</u>
<u n="2300" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2301" who="S0199">Ss and you know all of that kind of thing</u>
<u n="2302" who="S0192" trans="overlap">that's that's your personal preference</u>
<u n="2303" who="S0199" trans="overlap">because I think it will help him with writing and spelling</u>
<u n="2304" who="S0192">yeah I mean that's fine and that's a good argument for it</u>
<u n="2305" who="S0199" trans="overlap">because if he's doing his phonetics which is erm you know spelling out the letters whether we agree with it or not agree with it that's how he's learning</u>
<u n="2306" who="S0192">but that's</u>
<u n="2307" who="S0199" trans="overlap">so when he comes to write it if he's seeing in his head Mar-in he's never gonna write it properly</u>
<u n="2308" who="S0192">but what if</u>
<u n="2309" who="S0199" trans="overlap">and if he says Mar-tin</u>
<u n="2310" who="S0192">but what if we don't</u>
<u n="2311" who="S0199" trans="overlap">and he breaks the word down</u>
<u n="2312" who="S0192">I agree with what you're saying but what about if we don't teach him phonetics what if we don't say a T is always te sound? what if T sometimes is a er sound? what if you can say Mar-in? what if that's another variant of the T sound? he'll still know that you spell it T you write it T but sometimes T can be pronounced differently if it's at the beginning of a word truck</u>
<u n="2313" who="S0199" trans="overlap">but he won't know it at the moment will he?</u>
<u n="2314" who="S0192" trans="overlap">or teacher you're always gonna say te you're always gonna say teacher he will he'll he'll recognise that because the rule that you're talking about isn't it's it's in a specific location it happens at the beginning of <trunc>th</trunc> in the middle of the word or at the end of the word we also do it with er we don't say baker with an R we say baker er we just use a schwa</u>
<u n="2315" who="S0199" trans="overlap">baker yeah</u>
<u n="2316" who="S0192">so but we know that it's spelt E R because we understand that the E R sound can either be pronounced err or er</u>
<u n="2317" who="S0199">but he doesn't at the moment cos he's learning that</u>
<u n="2318" who="S0192">he will because he'll hear it whether or not you would know that he's doing it</u>
<u n="2319" who="S0199">ah</u>
<u n="2320" who="S0192">he'll learn that anyway he'll pick up that if I see say a T at the beginning of a word teacher it's always te sound but if I say a T in the middle of a word Mar-in it can either be er or te it depends on who I'm around and and</u>
<u n="2321" who="S0199" trans="overlap">or who's saying it</u>
<u n="2322" who="S0192" trans="overlap">or who's saying it</u>
<u n="2323" who="S0199" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2324" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah so he will pick up that variation and to a certain degree decide on who he wants to copy <pause dur="short"/> so if you're doing it one way and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s doing it the other way he'll learn both then he'll just decide which one he wants to do you may find he uses one with his friends and uses one with the teachers</u>
<u n="2325" who="S0199">I'm sure he will yeah</u>
<u n="2326" who="S0192">which I do around <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I drop my Ts so</u>
<u n="2327" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="2328" who="S0192">so I know what you're saying</u>
<u n="2329" who="S0191">mummy</u>
<u n="2330" who="S0192">but I don't want you to confuse</u>
<u n="2331" who="S0199" trans="overlap">yes darling</u>

<u n="2333" who="S0199">I can't darling I'm driving</u>
<u n="2334" who="S0192">I can see <pause dur="long"/> what's happening? is he gonna fall oh oh oh oh oh he's stuck on that was cool <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> see I don't want you to confuse <trunc>ph</trunc> phonetic reinforcement</u>
<u n="2335" who="S0191"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2336" who="S0199">no no I</u>
<u n="2337" who="S0192">and grammatical reinforcement</u>
<u n="2338" who="S0199">well that's why I thought I'd mention it because</u>
<u n="2339" who="S0191">oh look</u>
<u n="2340" who="S0199">I can do the grammar</u>
<u n="2341" who="S0192">oh</u>
<u n="2342" who="S0199">and I can and I've done started ever since you've said about it not correcting just answering back with the right</u>
<u n="2343" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2344" who="S0199">way</u>
<u n="2345" who="S0192">he'll get it <pause dur="short"/> he'll get it</u>
<u n="2346" who="S0199">er but I've found it tough not to correct speech</u>
<u n="2347" who="S0192">yeah and that's that's your preference if you want him to pronounce his words in a certain way then that's fine but that's different to grammar</u>
<u n="2348" who="S0191">awesome</u>
<u n="2349" who="S0192">that's different to the structure he will never say I pizza eat even though you'd think they'd try these variations from the immediate that they start speaking they'll always say and they'll probably start with pizza eat or</u>
<u n="2350" who="S0199">pizza</u>
<u n="2351" who="S0192">or I want I want or something</u>
<u n="2352" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="2353" who="S0192">they'll never say want I</u>
<u n="2354" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="2355" who="S0192">because they've already set those parameters</u>
<u n="2356" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="2357" who="S0192">even though there are languages that say want I or eat or pizza eat so he's not gonna make those grammatical mistakes in fact by the age of him now he's almost got all of his grammar <pause dur="short"/> he's pretty much got it all there's a couple of constructions that they find really difficult can I pull this down? cos it's really bright in my eye one of the hardest things for children to get and I'll test it in a second</u>
<u n="2358" who="S0199" trans="overlap">whose bottom's that?</u>
<u n="2359" who="S0192">oh that's very smelly it's not mine</u>
<u n="2360" who="S0191" trans="overlap">him</u>
<u n="2361" who="S0192">oh him</u>
<u n="2362" who="S0199"><vocal desc="laugh"/> who's him? <vocal desc="laugh"/> the man?</u>
<u n="2363" who="S0191">yes</u>
<u n="2364" who="S0192">one of the hardest things that children well one of the latest things that they have to learn is called passivise have you ever heard of the passive</u>
<u n="2365" who="S0191">hello</u>
<u n="2366" who="S0192">there are two types of sentence in English active and passive</u>
<u n="2367" who="S0199">I have heard of it but I am absolutely rubbish at remembering</u>
<u n="2368" who="S0192" trans="overlap">so for example I broke the car is active passive is the car was broken by me <pause dur="short"/> it's the same meaning but we're changing the object and the subject around no children if I say the car was <trunc>sh</trunc> if I remove me and I say the car was broken</u>
<u n="2369" who="S0191"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2370" who="S0192">and I say</u>
<u n="2371" who="S0191"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2372" who="S0192">they don't know</u>
<u n="2373" who="S0199">hold on sweetheart</u>
<u n="2374" who="S0192">sorry er let me try and think of another example where it's no an cos that's an inanimate object so that makes it clearer erm so for example <pause dur="short"/> the monkey kissed the lion the lion was kissed by the monkey if you asked them who did the kissing I the reversed one they can't tell they don't know that the lion was kissed by the monkey they still think that the lion kissed the monkey cos it's in that structure it takes for them to learn that you can reverse the subject and the object and the lion was kissed</u>
<u n="2375" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="2376" who="S0192">by the monkey is that the monkey's kissing the lion so it it it takes that's the one of the last things that they learn but they learn it they still pick it up and you don't need to teach them that</u>
<u n="2377" who="S0199">that's incredible isn't it?</u>
<u n="2378" who="S0192">it's just that they it's and that's part of our structure</u>
<u n="2379" who="S0191"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2380" who="S0192">in English we have syntactic structural meaning that depending on how we order the words effects the meaning that in English we go subject verb object the monkey kissed the lion subject verb object but other languages they could say the monkey the lion kissed and because they add an extra little sound so they add what's called a morpheme which could be the monkey O the lion E kissed and the O implies that the that's who did it and the E implies that that's who it was done to so then you can put it in any order because you've got a little thing that tells you who's the doer and who's the receiver we don't have that English so we have to structure it in a set way to say who's doing what <pause dur="short"/> so we English and other languages are different and er apparently</u>
<u n="2381" who="S0199" trans="overlap">very very interesting</u>
<u n="2382" who="S0192" trans="overlap">the children set those parameters as a child they can learn any language and through just listening those parameters get set and they go okay English is a language where I have to structure they're not consciously doing that but it's a tacit it's er unconscious <pause dur="short"/> it's a fascinating theory isn't it?</u>
<u n="2383" who="S0199">no it is it really really is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="2384" who="S0191">yeah</u>
<u n="2385" who="S0199">erm show <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> how you can count is it count? it in <trunc>I</trunc> Italian?</u>
<u n="2386" who="S0192">you can count go on then</u>
<u n="2387" who="S0191"><shift new="singing"/> <unclear/> <shift new="normal"/> <foreign lang="ita">uno due tre quattro cinque sei sette otto nove dieci</foreign></u>

<u n="2395" who="S0199">to count</u>

<u n="2397" who="S0199"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="2398" who="S0192">can you listen? in the sentence the zebra is kissed by the monkey who kissed who? the zebra is kissed by the monkey</u>
<u n="2399" who="S0191">the zebra</u>
<u n="2400" who="S0192">so <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="2401" who="S0191">kissed the monkey</u>
<u n="2402" who="S0192">the zebra kissed the monkey? see he got it the wrong way round <pause dur="short"/> they don't know that at the minute test him in another year and see what it is</u>
<u n="2403" who="S0199">interesting <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2404" who="S0192">it is interesting isn't it? if you say the zebra is kissed by the monkey</u>
<u n="2405" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="2406" who="S0192">he just hears the zebra kisses the monkey</u>
<u n="2407" who="S0199">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2408" who="S0192">it's strange isn't it?</u>
<u n="2409" who="S0199">yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="2410" who="S0192">it's good to be able to test it cos another year or two and he will he'll know that you you won't have a problem</u>
<u n="2411" who="S0199">try and remember that sentence</u>
<u n="2412" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2413" who="S0199">and we'll ask him again <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="long"/> what did you have for tea <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>? <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> what did you have to eat?</u>

<u n="2415" who="S0191">it has to go through the <unclear/></u>
<u n="2416" who="S0192">oh it does shall I try?</u>
<u n="2417" who="S0191">don't mind</u>
<u n="2418" who="S0192">oh I told you it would break didn't I? these things always break</u>
<u n="2419" who="S0199"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> what did you have to eat?</u>
<u n="2420" who="S0191">have to eat?</u>

<u n="2423" who="S0191">nothing</u>
<u n="2424" who="S0192">it's game over</u>
<u n="2425" who="S0191">why?</u>
<u n="2426" who="S0192">because you're right the hole's too small and the man's leg's too big <pause dur="short"/> so you can't fit that in there it doesn't fit but what you could do is pull the other leg out and then he'll still work maybe but at the minute he's broken <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="2427" who="S0199">normally they get all fluffy and then you can't use them at all</u>
<u n="2428" who="S0192">so if I asked him the toy was broken by <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he'd know that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> broke the toy because there's only one way round it could be</u>
<u n="2429" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="2430" who="S0192">that a toy can't break him so therefore it must be this way round</u>
<u n="2431" who="S0199">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2432" who="S0192">but with the zebra kisses the monkey either one can kiss each other so</u>
<u n="2433" who="S0199">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2434" who="S0192">so it can go either way</u>
<u n="2435" who="S0199" trans="overlap">so then they just hear in the first</u>
<u n="2436" who="S0192">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and they did that experiment with a whole bunch of children and they sat them down and they got you know different things and</u>
