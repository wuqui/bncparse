<u n="770" who="S0522">why would people want people chatting?</u>
<u n="771" who="S0520">it's a linguistic research so what they're doing is studying how people talk in order to create erm textbooks for English language learning that's more or less what I think because it's part of the erm language learning educational erm department in the university press so they've produced all this learning material for people learning English and for whatever reason they want to collect samples of how people speak English naturally like not in a contrived situation like not when they're making a speech or</u>
<u n="772" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="773" who="S0520">pretending to have a conversation</u>
<u n="774" who="S0519" trans="overlap">just chatting</u>
<u n="775" who="S0520">but just naturally they study it with all these different academic methods and erm a lot of it is very very technical I think linguistic stuff they go into the detail of how the sentences are structured and so on and they just I guess figure out from there what is the best way to teach people the language the most effective way to teach people and they produce erm educational materials it's a really big thing in <anon type="place"/> there was like a massive number of language schools there and in the summer young people used to come from all over</u>
<u n="776" who="S0519" trans="overlap">mm from all over the world yeah</u>
<u n="777" who="S0520">the world to learn English and so it's become quite the centre of it and this is one of the reasons they're doing this particular study is because language has changed so much in the last ten years because of the technology like phones and all devices and whatever</u>
<u n="778" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yes of course</u>
<u n="779" who="S0520">not not only are there a lot more words lot of new words which relate to technology and social media like Facebook and all of that but also erm the way that people actually communicate has changed so they want to make they want to have a sample but the last time they did it was fifteen years ago I can't remember twenty years ago maybe did something on this scale they want to have a</u>
<u n="780" who="S0519">mm another sample</u>
<u n="781" who="S0520">an updated sample basically and so they just set a erm goal to get two million</u>
<u n="782" who="S0519">oh</u>
<u n="783" who="S0520">minutes or something of spoken conversation and it doesn't matter what you're talking about who you're talking about it they they you'll have to fill in a very short form later but erm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
