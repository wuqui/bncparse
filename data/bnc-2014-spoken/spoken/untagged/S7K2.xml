<u n="16" who="S0355">erm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0281">therapy</u>
<u n="18" who="S0355">well counselling is a something a skill that we all had once and we've lost we gave it away due to manners and civility and I mean I still think you need to have manners because it's in the society and they're all different according to different societies</u>
<u n="19" who="S0281">absolutely</u>
<u n="20" who="S0355">erm but <pause dur="short"/> we gave a lot through religion we gave away erm earth religions which erm <pause dur="short"/> er is interesting I go to celebrations on solstices quite often</u>
<u n="21" who="S0281">uhu</u>
<u n="22" who="S0355">and erm that's interesting to to look into I I I find that fascinating and then we the <pause dur="short"/> the other thing we gave we gave that away to er domination of religion which is controlled spiritual philosophy <pause dur="short"/> and counselling I think we gave away to <pause dur="short"/> it was robbed from us it was we were we're not taught it in school we should be taught it in school I think</u>
<u n="23" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="24" who="S0355">we should be taught how to counsel each other</u>
<u n="25" who="S0281">do you think kids could handle it though?</u>
<u n="26" who="S0355">yes I think they're the they know it's they know it's the right way <trunc>i</trunc><trunc>i</trunc>impulsively cos it is the right way</u>
<u n="27" who="S0281">instinctively</u>
<u n="28" who="S0355">instinctively yes <pause dur="short"/> what's the difference between an impulse and an instinct?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0281">impulse is an immediate reaction</u>
<u n="30" who="S0355">right <pause dur="short"/> so it's a</u>
<u n="31" who="S0281" trans="overlap">and</u>
<u n="32" who="S0355" trans="overlap">reaction?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="34" who="S0355">right</u>
<u n="35" who="S0281">I mean and and I <trunc>g</trunc> those things you see when you checkout at the supermarket the they're called impulse purchasing</u>
<u n="36" who="S0355">yes</u>
<u n="37" who="S0281" trans="overlap">and you do it on the spur of the moment</u>
<u n="38" who="S0355">of course</u>
<u n="39" who="S0281" trans="overlap">it's not pre planned</u>
<u n="40" who="S0355">oh <pause dur="short"/> I see</u>
<u n="41" who="S0281">you do something on impulse you do it oh I fancy that I'll do it</u>
<u n="42" who="S0355">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0281">I mean instinct is something that erm is intrinsic I think in us that probably is passed down through our DNA somehow <pause dur="short"/> like animal instinct</u>
<u n="44" who="S0355">yes</u>
<u n="45" who="S0281">when a an animal is born very often or depending on the species of course it can get up and start walking immediately</u>
<u n="46" who="S0355">yes</u>
<u n="47" who="S0281">by instinct</u>
<u n="48" who="S0355">they say a lot of it was well someone said to me once and I tend to agree with them and it may be a column I'm sure there have been loads of millions of books written on it but breakdowns <trunc>esse</trunc>essentially occur in human beings when they're told and and er when they're told that if they behave in a certain way their life will work for them get a job be responsible stand up for your country do all these things erm and life will <pause dur="short"/> be alright</u>
<u n="49" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="50" who="S0355"><vocal desc="cough"/> and they get to midlife and they realise that their life isn't working and they've <pause dur="short"/> forgotten the spiritual aspect of their life you know their spirit their spirit is something that is within them and wants to do things and <pause dur="short"/> er is is basically a joyful thing spirit's a joyful thing it's the joy within us the spirit of man it's not a not a not a something outside of us it's something <trunc>wi</trunc> I think it is with er with a yeah <trunc>th</trunc> spirit of god I think is everywhere we've just got to open ourselves to it erm and many religions <trunc>pra</trunc> <trunc>pre</trunc>preach that or or teach that and <pause dur="short"/> but I think the way that they cloak it all is in mystery and superstition and er</u>
<u n="51" who="S0281">dogma</u>
<u n="52" who="S0355">dogma and er all these bloody things yeah but the <trunc>ma</trunc>man or woman gets to a point in their lives especially in men with the work ethic they get to the <trunc>wor</trunc> a point in their lives where they say my life isn't working and I'm doing but I'm doing all the right things that society says is the way to go and it's not we we're we're driven by market forces and we're driven by the fact that we have to rent a house from the landlord or buy a house at er a great proportion of our wage robbing us essentially of time because money is time and time is money <pause dur="short"/> we change our we exchange our time on this earth for money <pause dur="short"/> they're units of time and <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0281">so where did you think in that <pause dur="short"/> lies the the clich√© of midlife crisis?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0355">er well I think a man gets to a time when <pause dur="short"/> basically he should have had more fun I think you know and er <pause dur="short"/> it happens I suspect generally forties fifties</u>
<u n="55" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0355">and er <pause dur="short"/> it's just the time that it happens it happens in younger erm people who are in their twenties you know when they're <pause dur="short"/> when they're working against themselves really they're they're the the deeper psyche they're on their subconscious or unconscious mind subconscious mind they're <pause dur="short"/> er <trunc>m</trunc> part of them I don't know all the parts the ego the id the subconscious the conscious the that's all parts of the mind but <pause dur="short"/> part of the human being that they're restricting through living their lives in a particular way er through compromise erm er just isn't being fed isn't being nurtured it's been put on the backburner and all the time we say I'll go on holiday next year I'll do this later in my life I when I'm got enough money to do it</u>
<u n="57" who="S0281" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0355">I'll do this then and er and the forces that be or the way that things go say that money is always the factor you know <pause dur="short"/> kids naturally look for parties and places to dance and enjoy and rejoice and <pause dur="short"/> the police go and stop these parties they say oh drugs are involved yeah well you know traditionally drugs have always been involved in parties <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0355"><vocal desc="laugh"/> from the year dot so erm <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="61" who="S0281">but it's being separated isn't it? from er his er mystical element to just getting out of your mind but without any specific purpose other than to get out of your mind <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="62" who="S0355">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0281" trans="overlap">I was thinking in particular remember Carlos Castaneda's books? <pause dur="short"/> like when he's tripping on peyote</u>
<u n="64" who="S0355">oh right er what was the book called? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="65" who="S0281">oh I think he did several I can't remember</u>
<u n="66" who="S0355">yes</u>
<u n="67" who="S0281">a particular one at the moment <pause dur="short"/> I mean the main character's called Carlos or something <unclear/> but it's it's set in I think it was set in Mexico or Texas or somewhere like that <pause dur="short"/> and it was about his mystical experiences under the the influence of this drug <pause dur="long"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> well at least the <trunc>leg</trunc>legislation has started to change in a lot of places <pause dur="short"/> isn't it? <trunc>be</trunc></u>
<u n="68" who="S0355" trans="overlap">yeah like but</u>
<u n="69" who="S0281" trans="overlap">mm better late than never</u>
<u n="70" who="S0355">yeah but again it's been by capitalists to make money if you look all all the all the erm it's the way that the Americans have now legalised cannabis A you've got to have a medical condition to be able to warrant your possession of it and usage of it</u>
<u n="71" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0355">and probably B growing it is still illegal so</u>
<u n="73" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0355">again they they they again the er the means of production</u>
<u n="75" who="S0281" trans="overlap">they wanna control the means of production yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0355" trans="overlap">has been taken away from the workers you know</u>
<u n="77" who="S0281" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0355">as everything you <trunc>kn</trunc> er that's being done er you could say it's from the use of herbicides where we could go er get gather herbs in the countryside to the erm <pause dur="short"/> introduction of myxomatosis the and the countryman's food in the rabbit has now been poisoned so there's very few ways that you the the the common land that you could farm and feed your animals on or even build a house on under <trunc>cir</trunc>circumstances has been taken away from us <pause dur="short"/> and so er er they give clever reasons for it all but essentially erm it's they're all ways that have either intentionally or unintentionally taken away free food free living from</u>
<u n="79" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0355">from people <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> it's it's all part of a plan that we are enslaved totally</u>
<u n="81" who="S0281"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="82" who="S0355" trans="overlap">we have to pay for everything even water</u>
<u n="83" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0355">and this is the big thing going on in third world countries now that er people like Coca-Cola are moving their plants to India where they have only a limited amount of water and the ground water now is polluted by what Coca-Cola does and the products that Coca-Cola make instead of being drunk but the local <trunc>po</trunc>population and passed through their bodies and put back in the ground it that doesn't happen in that area so it even depletes the groundwater more erm so er and the Coca-Cola is <trunc>so</trunc>sold hundreds of miles or thousands of miles away so er the it goes on without the regard of the <trunc>indivi</trunc>vidual with er with rights you know <pause dur="long"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> continually there are people in this world working out ways of how to charge people for things how they can make money out of everything charge for every single thing and that erm and that's not right when we're born onto this planet we're born with rights that er you know it's it's your world it's no one owns it but the capitalists own it now so and now the the capitalists are buying up small farms there won't be any small farms in fifty years' time they'll all be run by big corporations</u>
<u n="85" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0355">all the animals are farmed in buildings pigs the cattle <pause dur="short"/> all farmed inside sheep</u>
<u n="87" who="S0281">yes I think we we were lucky in our generation to to have been born when we were cos I wouldn't like to be growing up now</u>
<u n="88" who="S0355">no <pause dur="short"/> well I'm still growing up now</u>
<u n="89" who="S0281"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah I'm still wondering what I'm gonna do when I grow up</u>
<u n="90" who="S0355">yes <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0281"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0355">oh <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="93" who="S0281">me <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0355">what's your take on it?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0281">well I think most of what you've said is absolutely true <pause dur="short"/> it's erm <pause dur="short"/> we seem to <trunc>ha</trunc> be our er as as you said it's erm all of our natural born freedoms are gradually being eroded <pause dur="short"/> are being controlled more and more <pause dur="short"/> I mean look at the society we in we're in we're lucky in many respects to be in the society we're living in look at the amount of people trying to get here er illegally so they can benefit from it but er <pause dur="short"/> it's thinking er when you think this is one of the best places to live <vocal desc="laugh"/> and all the things that are wrong with it <pause dur="short"/> the things we can't do <pause dur="short"/> more and more control over us more and more spying on us <pause dur="short"/> that have er come to light in the last few years the whistle blowers <pause dur="short"/> you see I America the er the time limit on the erm on the er er American government's er legal right to snoop on people's private emails has now expired so and like they now can't do do that unless they they get apply for a specific permission but I saw an on a programme not long ago in the UK when er the police or government erm apply for the the the legal right to do this to its citizens it's it's mm almost automatically granted in ninety-six percent of the cases <pause dur="short"/> and they've never been more er surveillance you know the CCTVs <pause dur="short"/> and er I'm sure there's lots of things that are gonna come to light sooner or later that they're doing now <pause dur="short"/> mm spying on us <pause dur="long"/> but we've still got the right to a certain degree of to go out on the street get up on your soapbox and say what you like more or less <pause dur="long"/> I think in China that erm they're not allowed to have meetings of more than six people or something like that <pause dur="short"/> at er in any one place unless they've got <trunc>poli</trunc>police permission <pause dur="short"/> but that's gonna be an interesting case sooner or later because <pause dur="short"/> the the generation that's now starting to reproduce and er they've grown up in a in a society although strictly controlled by the government erm they're expecting more and more freedoms so that's it's a lot of people think that sooner or later there's gonna be a revolution there <pause dur="short"/> but er I don't know it's er they've got such a tight control on everything on everybody <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0355">that's <unclear/> yeah and most of the governments in the world <pause dur="long"/> it doesn't bode well for the future <pause dur="long"/> it was interesting watching that programme Inside the Medieval Mind the other day</u>
<u n="97" who="S0281">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="98" who="S0355" trans="overlap">after he mentioned what if you remember he mentioned what happened after the black death</u>
<u n="99" who="S0281">I don't think I was watching it</u>
<u n="100" who="S0355">yeah you watched it</u>
<u n="101" who="S0281" trans="overlap">did I?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0355" trans="overlap">sat there and watched how the how the peasants were treated and</u>
<u n="103" who="S0281">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0355">and one thing he you know what they could do to serfs they serfs you worked for the person and that was it for the rest of your life and er</u>
<u n="105" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0355">you were enslaved to them basically you couldn't say well I don't want to work on your land anymore you couldn't do that you er your children were <trunc>b</trunc>born into serfdom so it it was that was all all pretty <trunc>sc</trunc>scary and horrible wasn't it? so erm what <pause dur="short"/> er happened after the black death was that the erm because there were there wasn't the labour it killed so many people that there wasn't the labour left in the in the land</u>
<u n="107" who="S0281">oh</u>
<u n="108" who="S0355">so then <pause dur="short"/> er you found that the the serfs well they gave the instance of a plough man who said no I I want more money <vocal desc="laugh"/> and I want better living conditions to plough your land and I shall go elsewhere to find it and that black death had an effect on the on the system so all I can think of is well you know it's now maybe we're so controlled because we're overpopulated and they find they fear <pause dur="short"/> that if there was a revolution by the working man er <pause dur="short"/> they would be swamped wouldn't they? and so they have to control them even tighter <pause dur="short"/> it's interesting listening to that mm er there was a guy on <pause dur="short"/> on the <pause dur="short"/> on YouTube I don't know if it was Noam Chomsky but he was saying that people <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> er <pause dur="short"/> when they erm <pause dur="long"/> why people aren't voting is because er I think he was talking about democracy and capitalism he was saying so many people er <pause dur="short"/> don't vote because they they believe they're powerless anyway it's they're they're they're not going to be listened to anyway and it's only erm er and the governments aren't doing anything or the English government isn't doing anything and the American government for the dispossessed the poor</u>
<u n="109" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0355">and the ones who haven't got money</u>
<u n="111" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0355">which is becoming the greater amount of people in the country <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="113" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0355" trans="overlap">even the middle class there are suffering so he's erm er er so he was talking about England and I would imagine America that erm the er being a democracy it doesn't count for anything because they're not making the laws that benefit the people of the country</u>
<u n="115" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0355">you know the country and the government should be there to benefit the people</u>
<u n="117" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="118" who="S0355">not just the privileged few</u>
<u n="119" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0355">or the bankers</u>
<u n="121" who="S0281">that's just a <pause dur="short"/> bit one sided isn't it? cos er for big</u>
<u n="122" who="S0355" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="123" who="S0281" trans="overlap">big business</u>
<u n="124" who="S0355">mm he's great to listen to Noam Chomsky</u>
<u n="125" who="S0281" trans="overlap">yeah oh he is</u>
<u n="126" who="S0355">I think he's Jewish isn't he?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0355">yeah a good <pause dur="short"/> you wanna hear what he has to say about <pause dur="short"/> israel <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="129" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0355">is just get rid of it if it bomb the lot of it <vocal desc="laugh"/> wipe it off the face of the earth</u>
<u n="131" who="S0281"><vocal desc="sigh"/> well if anybody did dare that dare do that they'd take a hell of a lot of people with them <pause dur="short"/> supposed to have about a hundred and eighty missiles at the moment</u>
<u n="132" who="S0355">well</u>
<u n="133" who="S0281" trans="overlap">and they don't <trunc>kn</trunc> admit to it but</u>
<u n="134" who="S0355">Israel's been experimenting with dirty bombs</u>
<u n="135" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0355" trans="overlap">have you seen that?</u>
<u n="137" who="S0281">yeah I saw that the other night</u>
<u n="138" who="S0355">they've they've tested about five or six dirty bombs so they let go of a dirty bomb and then they go and see what what it's caused what damage it's caused and so I suppose that information could be used in several ways one way is what damage you can inflict on your enemy <pause dur="short"/> maybe a to create a <trunc>radiatio</trunc> radiated buffer state around you <pause dur="short"/> irradiated buffer state rather and er <pause dur="short"/> or whether you can er develop a non dirty bomb <pause dur="short"/> through those processes but that's what they've been testing non dirty bombs to see how non dirty they were not dirty bombs to see how dirty they were <pause dur="short"/> do you get my drift? <pause dur="short"/> why test the bomb to see how dirty it is? unless you think well we'll see if someone sends one here who I don't can't imagine it's no one <trunc>li</trunc> I don't think any of their enemies er have got any nuclear weapons Pakistan might have Pakistan</u>
<u n="139" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="140" who="S0355">Pakistan's got some I think</u>
<u n="141" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="142" who="S0355">but erm oh yeah how do we attempt to clean up? or how do we <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>h</trunc> er what's gonna happen if we we do let this go on all these other states? what effects what will we have to deal with <pause dur="short"/> in what in what it will be essentially land that we we now claim as victors?</u>
