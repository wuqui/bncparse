<u n="1" who="S0136">have you had a good weekend?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0065">I did yeah <pause dur="short"/> I took my children to <anon type="place"/> Forest on Sunday <pause dur="short"/> the weather was okay <pause dur="short"/> so we got in the car and drove to <anon type="place"/> and it was really nice</u>
<u n="3" who="S0136" trans="overlap">oh brilliant <pause dur="short"/> so anything else special because it was  it was  Mother's Day wasn't it?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0065">oh yeah it was Mother's Day <pause dur="short"/> yeah my husband cooked <pause dur="short"/> he spent all weekend cooking which was supposed to be nice for me but it meant that I did most of the childcare <pause dur="short"/> and so that was nice <pause dur="short"/> and the girls had bought flowers <pause dur="short"/> well you know pretended to buy flowers</u>
<u n="5" who="S0136">aw</u>
<u n="6" who="S0065">and stuff <pause dur="short"/> so that was lovely <pause dur="short"/> we just</u>
<u n="7" who="S0136">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0065">we just  spent the day together you know <pause dur="short"/> it was kind of treat because my husband's away quite a lot so <pause dur="short"/> what about you?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0136">well you know it was okay <pause dur="short"/> sunday was good because <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> basically took <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> away <trunc>bi</trunc> on a bike <pause dur="short"/> so I had like some extra sleep really <pause dur="short"/> and that was nice</u>
<u n="10" who="S0065" trans="overlap">oh lovely <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0136">yeah he's too little really to do anything else <pause dur="short"/> he made me a card at playgroup but that's about all</u>
<u n="12" who="S0065">yeah <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had made some funny crafts at her <anon type="place"/> school which she was really thrilled with but then she em she gave them to me on Friday after school and she got so excited that she was opening them to show me <pause dur="short"/> so she completely missed the point of the gift was for Sunday</u>
<u n="13" who="S0136">which school is that?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0065">it's the one in <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0136">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0065">it's just the mornings <pause dur="short"/> it's just morning school so nine till one</u>
<u n="17" who="S0136">that's the same thing as they have in Lode you know where I live <pause dur="short"/> so they have a <anon type="place"/> inspired kind of preschool thing <pause dur="short"/> and I think yeah I think it's mornings only as well <pause dur="short"/> I'd love to eh you know when my son is a bit older I'd like him to go there</u>
<u n="18" who="S0065">yeah I think it's good</u>
<u n="19" who="S0136">yeah <pause dur="short"/> do they do anything special there? Anything different?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0065">well I don't really know because I don't pick her up <pause dur="short"/> I I only see her at four o'clock so when I get her she's usually forgotten what she's done <pause dur="short"/> but when I have visited the impression I get is that it's much more child led <pause dur="short"/> so they do what they like <pause dur="short"/> they're not going from activity to activity as defined by the teachers <pause dur="short"/> you know if they want to do water play all morning they can <pause dur="short"/> if they want to play with wooden blocks all morning they can <pause dur="short"/> so it's very much just sort of pupil more child-led <pause dur="short"/> which I like about it</u>
<u n="21" who="S0136">oh brilliant</u>
<u n="22" who="S0065">Cos she's only three <pause dur="short"/> if she wants to play all morning then let her you know that's fine <pause dur="short"/> but they do push them a bit more than the other the preschool to you know if they're interested in numbers and letters then they'll let them have a go <pause dur="short"/> whereas I think the other preschool in the village tries not to do the stuff that they'll be doing in school</u>
<u n="23" who="S0136">yeah that sounds good <pause dur="short"/> I kind of put him on the waiting list for that Lode one <pause dur="short"/> and maybe you know I mean you know hopefully by the time he's old enough to go I should be enough spaces for those people who want to go really</u>
<u n="24" who="S0065">yeah <pause dur="short"/> what I liked was that em it's smaller <pause dur="short"/> so you know there are more staff to children <pause dur="short"/> and it's just a bit calmer cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is ever so <pause dur="short"/> well she's very <pause dur="short"/> mm maybe not highly strung but high maintenance</u>
<u n="25" who="S0136">oh right</u>
<u n="26" who="S0065">she's quite demanding <pause dur="short"/> so I think being in a calm environment helps her you know deal with things</u>
<u n="27" who="S0136">well my son actually <pause dur="short"/> em I had to take him to the doctors this morning <pause dur="short"/> em cos last night he didn't sleep at all because you know he has some sort of rash or something <pause dur="short"/> so he spent half the night scratching himself <pause dur="short"/> whether it's chicken pox or</u>
<u n="28" who="S0065" trans="overlap">it's not chicken pox is it?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0136">I'm not quite sure actually because it's like you know <pause dur="short"/> the doctor said it wasn't but we had to go from like one person to another person because they weren't sure <pause dur="short"/> and then they gave us like a whole bag of creams and things you know to put on him <pause dur="short"/> but he was absolutely fine this morning he was just playing there and just you know having fun really you know <pause dur="short"/> wouldn't wouldn't tell that he wasn't sleeping all day <pause dur="short"/> whereas in the morning I was like ha ha I want to sleep</u>
<u n="30" who="S0065">oh it's horrible</u>
<u n="31" who="S0136">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0065">chicken pox is going around <pause dur="short"/> my girls haven't had it yet but <pause dur="short"/> they don't seem to get anything</u>
<u n="33" who="S0136">ah lucky you</u>
<u n="34" who="S0065">so can he go to childcare today?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0136">well he didn't go <pause dur="short"/> my mother-in-law has him today because they moved recently <pause dur="short"/> they moved to the area recently <pause dur="short"/> and so you know we'll see tomorrow anyway</u>
<u n="36" who="S0065">yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0136">he normally goes to a child-minder three days a week and to grandparents two days a week so</u>
<u n="38" who="S0065">did you sort out your child-minder problem cos you were looking for someone weren't you?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0136">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah she was  she was  okay <pause dur="short"/> cos she had to have an operation <pause dur="short"/> and then it turned out that I had to have an operation as well <pause dur="short"/> because I just had to have emergency surgery with appendicitis <pause dur="short"/> and then eh you know he was actually looked after by my mum for a bit <pause dur="short"/> and then you know after that he was you know the child-minder was fine again you know she's okay now</u>
<u n="40" who="S0065">okay <pause dur="short"/> so you're still using the same person?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0136">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well it's kind of handy cos she's only opposite the school literally you know <pause dur="short"/> lives opposite the college</u>
<u n="42" who="S0065">yeah perfect</u>
<u n="43" who="S0136">yeah no it's pretty good yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0065">mine's not far <pause dur="short"/> she's just round the corner from me in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> but me you know it's just <pause dur="short"/> l I try and get there at four o'clock but every night it's five past four ten past four five past four <pause dur="short"/> it's really hard <pause dur="short"/> there's just so much going on at school that leaving on time is really difficult</u>
<u n="45" who="S0136">how's your day been today?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0065">eh it's been good cos today is an easy day for me I only teach two lessons <pause dur="short"/> so I have three frees to get loads of work done <pause dur="short"/> usually I'm taken for a couple but today I wasn't <pause dur="short"/> but my day started badly because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had a tantrum at the child-minders <pause dur="short"/> because when we got out of the car she'd lost her bracelet <pause dur="short"/> she was wearing a little pink you know silly little jewellery thing and she just went mad completely mad <pause dur="short"/> and I had to actually call school to say I may not be in on time because she ran up the road and you know I had to go chasing after her <pause dur="short"/> I've got the one year old in the car and the school bags</u>
<u n="47" who="S0136">did you find it in the end or not?</u>
<u n="48" who="S0065">no no <pause dur="short"/> I gave her a packet of crisps and that seemed to em fix the problem</u>
<u n="49" who="S0136">oh yeah it was the same thing today at the doctors as well you know <pause dur="short"/> a packet of crisps</u>
<u n="50" who="S0065">mm <pause dur="short"/> I had to go rifling through my lunchbox <pause dur="short"/> what have I got that she likes? Cereal bar? Crisps? Must always have food bribes in the car <pause dur="short"/> I'd forgotten that</u>
<u n="51" who="S0136">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> definitely <pause dur="short"/> well my husband when he worked in a different school somebody said to him that basically bribery is the basics of today's education</u>
<u n="52" who="S0065">exactly <pause dur="short"/> it's teaching and parenting isn't it?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0136">yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0065">it's a shame really</u>
<u n="55" who="S0136">Cos the school I used to work at <pause dur="short"/> there was a language teacher there who used to when the year elevens did really well at the lesson she used to give them sweets <pause dur="short"/> and I kind of found it a bit strange because you know sure year eleven they don't really need things like that</u>
<u n="56" who="S0065">it's ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> I mean I just I had two year ten lessons today <pause dur="short"/> so these are people who have opted to study German <pause dur="short"/> and my objective this year is to try and speak more German in class because that's really tough to get them to do <pause dur="short"/> and I'd tried everything and this time I'm giving them raffle tickets every time they say something <pause dur="short"/> so I've got a book of raffle tickets <pause dur="short"/> every time they say something to me in German I give them a raffle ticket <pause dur="short"/> and at the end we have a prize draw and they get a packet of Maltesers</u>
<u n="57" who="S0136">oh brilliant</u>
<u n="58" who="S0065">I mean it's just ridiculous isn't it? They've opted they're doing a GSCE but to get them to speak German which is why they should me in my classroom I actually had to bribe them</u>
<u n="59" who="S0136" trans="overlap">that actually works</u>
<u n="60" who="S0065">I have to reward them with bags of chocolate <pause dur="short"/> it works but it's wrong</u>
<u n="61" who="S0136">well in in real life nobody will give them Maltesers for speaking German sadly</u>
<u n="62" who="S0065">no exactly <pause dur="short"/> but it's the only way I can get to hear them speaking any German and it's the only way they're going to make some progress <pause dur="short"/> I've tried the non-chocolate methods</u>
<u n="63" who="S0136">I used to just em when I was doing work experience I was kind of em just assisting really you know the teacher who was you know working with a class who opted to do German <pause dur="short"/> and what we did is just take them out of the classroom one by one and just coach them on the questions that would be asked at the exam <pause dur="short"/> and as soon as they were out of the classroom just one to one with me for example they were like he he he I don't know anything <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah I do actually know this <pause dur="short"/> so that kind of thing you know</u>
<u n="64" who="S0065">yeah it's nerve wracking <pause dur="short"/> and the thing is the exam has changed now so you can't just drill them in those twenty questions or whatever and hope that you know and ask from that set of questions <pause dur="short"/> it's a bit more it has to be a bit more spontaneous now <pause dur="short"/> in a way <pause dur="short"/> in some ways less but in some ways more <pause dur="short"/> so what you really need is for them to have some confidence of doing it by themselves <pause dur="short"/> they can do it it's just practice but it takes so much lesson tine just forcing them to say something <pause dur="short"/> it's tricky</u>
<u n="65" who="S0136">well I kind of thought the exchange trips are probably incentive enough <pause dur="short"/> but they're probably not</u>
<u n="66" who="S0065">I took twenty kids to well seventeen to em to Germany at half term <pause dur="short"/> and there's still at least one of those who hasn't said a word of German to me since she got back <pause dur="short"/> it comes down to your personality</u>
<u n="67" who="S0136">I know</u>
<u n="68" who="S0065">you're either going to do it or you're not <pause dur="short"/> no amount of cajoling with Maltesers or trips is going to change that</u>
<u n="69" who="S0136">I think so <pause dur="short"/> and it's also difficult because if you have a class of kids who speak the same language then obviously they would speak the same language to each other</u>
<u n="70" who="S0065">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0136">Cos when I was working in the language school I had the same problem <pause dur="short"/> erm I mostly taught English to people who were from Germany or Switzerland <pause dur="short"/> and because the they were basically you know classes of speakers of the same language</u>
<u n="72" who="S0065">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0136">even though I spoke English to them they spoke German between themselves <pause dur="short"/> and so it was a really difficult task to get them to speak English including to you know like each other as well</u>
<u n="74" who="S0065">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think the only ways you can do it is by having a mixed nationality class cos then they don't share a common language</u>
<u n="75" who="S0136" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm yeah different</u>
<u n="76" who="S0065">but it it I mean it's obvious <pause dur="short"/> you would speak your native language to the person sitting next to you wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0136" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0065">it's contrived otherwise</u>
<u n="79" who="S0136">yeah the mixed ones are a lot more fun because erm you know it's it's actually nice to see how they interact with each other and without knowing they actually help each other which which is great</u>
<u n="80" who="S0065">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah that must be true</u>
<u n="81" who="S0136">even with the normal classes just like you know in mainstream schools <pause dur="short"/> er I remember working in a group once in a  group with like kids with real low abilities things like that <pause dur="short"/> and also there were two girls there one from Thailand and one from Poland <pause dur="short"/> and they just put them in the same group and I was just thinking oh how am I going to cope? I mean you know they don't really speak much English neither of them <pause dur="short"/> but then you know they were sat together and before too long I just found that they were kind of you know trying to communicate with each <trunc>oth</trunc> each other and just helping each other which was brilliant</u>
<u n="82" who="S0065" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> and then they've got a motivation so they're more likely to make progress</u>
<u n="83" who="S0136">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0065">so were you teaching English as a foreign language?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0136">em I was yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was teaching a language school English as a foreign language for couple or years <pause dur="short"/> and then after that I was just a teaching assistant in a normal school doing all sorts really <pause dur="short"/> but yeah I'm basically CELTA trained</u>
<u n="86" who="S0065">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0136">so yeah I trained in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> that was good fun actually</u>
<u n="88" who="S0065">so that's not TEFL or?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0136">eh it's eh yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's it's similar <pause dur="short"/> it's a similar thing</u>
<u n="90" who="S0065">what's it called?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0136">CELTA <pause dur="short"/> cELTA stands for Certificate of English Language Teaching to Adults</u>
<u n="92" who="S0065">oh Okay</u>
<u n="93" who="S0136">and TEFL is just like a general umbrella term for Teaching English as a Foreign Language</u>
<u n="94" who="S0065">so why aren't you teaching English as a foreign language now? Did you?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0136">mm <pause dur="short"/> well there's <pause dur="short"/> I just find that it's a bit irregular <pause dur="short"/> because the thing is er you depend on people who come from other countries</u>
<u n="96" who="S0065">mm mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0136">and if they're for example school aged students then you have to wait till they have like a holiday or something like that you know a break from third term</u>
<u n="98" who="S0065" trans="overlap">oh I see <pause dur="short"/> mm mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0136">and then so you know <trunc>some</trunc> sometimes er sometimes it's really busy <pause dur="short"/> like I remember when I lived in Sussex and worked in a language school em summer was really busy Easter was quite busy <pause dur="short"/> then in winter there was nothing <pause dur="short"/> and so</u>
<u n="100" who="S0065">and actually when you have children that's not what you want <pause dur="short"/> you want it to be busy in term time don't you?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0136" trans="overlap">no absolutely <pause dur="short"/> yeah absolutely yeah <pause dur="short"/> but you know <pause dur="short"/> it was  It was  good fun though definitely you know</u>
<u n="102" who="S0065">yeah I'd love to do that actually <pause dur="short"/> it must be great to teach language to people who really want to learn it and really need it rather than you know school kind who are just kind of doing it because don't know they need it to perhaps bet on to the next stage of education <pause dur="short"/> they might not every use it for real purposes</u>
<u n="103" who="S0136">well actually  they're doing this starting this course now for <pause dur="short"/> basically an ESL course for you know people who who's English is not you know English is not their first language</u>
<u n="104" who="S0065">are they? Oh wow</u>
<u n="105" who="S0136">yeah they they just literally <pause dur="short"/> I think they have an <trunc>in</trunc> information evening about that em either today or tomorrow cos Julie asked me to sort something out for it <pause dur="short"/> so yeah you might</u>
<u n="106" who="S0065">mm <pause dur="short"/> are you going to be teaching?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0136">no no no I'm just sorting out some resources <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure who's meant to be <trunc>te</trunc> who's going to be teaching actually</u>
<u n="108" who="S0065">they must have the teacher already I suppose</u>
<u n="109" who="S0136">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it's just a <pause dur="short"/> what's happening in the next few days is just like a just like an information really you know for people who are potentially interested <pause dur="short"/> there's always stuff like that happening</u>
<u n="110" who="S0065">yeah I could see that being a career move later in life <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I can do classroom teaching until I'm sixty-eight or whatever it is we have to be now before we can retire</u>
<u n="111" who="S0136">I can relate to that <pause dur="short"/> well my husband can definitely because he's been teaching for thirteen years <pause dur="short"/> em <pause dur="short"/> and he's a bit kind of tired of it <pause dur="short"/> eh he teaches primary and even at primarily he says sometimes it's just too hard so</u>
<u n="112" who="S0065">well primary is busy isn't it? I don't think you get as much free time <pause dur="short"/> I mean I get a little bit of free time</u>
<u n="113" who="S0136">and you have to teach everything as well every subject <pause dur="short"/> so it's a lot more pressure really on you now <pause dur="short"/> and also the expectation expectations I think are quite high <pause dur="short"/> because obviously you know the secondary school are like you know small fish big pond <pause dur="short"/> whereas there it's like the other way round</u>
<u n="114" who="S0065">yeah <pause dur="short"/> where does he teach?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0136">well at the moment in Linton <pause dur="short"/> but then it's only a temporary job so from Easter I think he's going to <anon type="place"/> or something</u>
<u n="116" who="S0065">I don't know it</u>
<u n="117" who="S0136">it's a very very small school <pause dur="short"/> like a really tiny one</u>
<u n="118" who="S0065">what age does he teach then?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0136">oh just all ages <pause dur="short"/> at the moment I think it's year six</u>
<u n="120" who="S0065">okay <pause dur="short"/> so the bigger ones</u>
<u n="121" who="S0136">yeah no he doesn't really have much experience with very very young ones you know <pause dur="short"/> well neither do I <pause dur="short"/> I'm not really into very small kids you know apart from my own you know?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0065">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="123" who="S0136">but it's different when they're your own kids</u>
<u n="124" who="S0065">I don't really like little kids <pause dur="short"/> I've just got two of my own</u>
<u n="125" who="S0136">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Well you know <pause dur="short"/> you know how it is <pause dur="short"/> it's like different with your own kids isn't it</u>
