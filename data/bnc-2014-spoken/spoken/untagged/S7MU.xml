<u n="121" who="S0037">well</u>
<u n="122" who="S0115">it it makes it harder to justify uh funding it through the state</u>
<u n="123" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well even if it is a big party like people have different ideas about <trunc>bout</trunc> what a big party means <pause dur="short"/> for me big party doesn't mean like cracking the eggs out and just scrambling them all over your flat like</u>
<u n="124" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0037">like <pause dur="short"/> you know what I mean? There's limits isn't there like? Even I <trunc>th</trunc> I suppose even if I was totally out of me mind</u>

<u n="128" who="S0115" trans="overlap">you know <pause dur="short"/> today's young people</u>
<u n="129" who="S0037">no but even if I was really you know had had loads of beer or whatever I don't think I would ever I I could never entertain the idea of like smashing eggs everywhere it doesn't seem like a good plan and I don't know what I would gain from that</u>
<u n="130" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0037">and in fact I've never really understood people who do that like who smash things and mess things up when they're</u>
<u n="132" who="S0115" trans="overlap">smashers?</u>
<u n="133" who="S0037">like I can understand people who</u>

<u n="136" who="S0115" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Inside washing machines?</u>
<u n="137" who="S0037">but <trunc>th</trunc> there's an element of you know you need to go and okay maybe you don't choose the best place or whatever <pause dur="short"/> so I can <pause dur="short"/> I never would condone it and I would never do it meself but I can <pause dur="short"/> I have an element of sort of compassion or I can sort of see why that might happen but things like just <trunc>m</trunc> just smashing things or just throwing things out of windows or</u>
<u n="138" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0037">I mean I saw a lot of it</u>

<u n="143" who="S0037">of course I mean</u>
<u n="144" who="S0115">but</u>
<u n="145" who="S0037">but I think we always give like we always did give people <trunc>u</trunc> the benefit of the doubt like we always got them in and let them like explain like what they were doing</u>
<u n="146" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0037">or why they were doing it <pause dur="short"/> and like from time to time we did get people in who were saying who would say things like I'd been out and I'd got really drunk because my nana had died and my dad had died my <pause dur="short"/> I'd had a really bad thing and <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="148" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well that's terrible using that as an excuse isn't it?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0037">and like <pause dur="short"/> no but if if it had happened and if  and if  that was why they were doing that like we did always cut them some slack but <pause dur="short"/> it's when you get idiots in going muh I just wanted to like</u>
