<u n="1" who="S0084">did you sleep alright?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0083">it is chilly isn't it?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4" who="S0083">well I woke up early and I I did drop off again so</u>
<u n="5" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="6" who="S0083">but it is annoying to do that <pause dur="short"/> and I  and I  often do <pause dur="short"/> anyway <pause dur="short"/> anyway <pause dur="short"/> well there's nothing else to do</u>
<u n="7" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> the nice weather might come back next week</u>
<u n="8" who="S0083">well hopefully <pause dur="short"/> basically <pause dur="short"/> you never tell can you with these with the English weather</u>
<u n="9" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="10" who="S0083">anyway</u>
<u n="11" who="S0084">well it did say it was going to rain on Tuesday</u>
<u n="12" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="13" who="S0084">so erm are any of the groups you're in organising protests around the Jubilee or the Olympics or anything? Cos the unions have threatened to disrupt the Olympics haven't they? No <pause dur="short"/> or was it the guy who runs the tubes or something? Well they're they're threatening to have a tube</u>
<u n="14" who="S0083" trans="overlap">not that I'm aware of</u>
<u n="15" who="S0084">I can't I thought it was someone from who was a a union member but anyway he erm he was speaking and I think it was when the tube drivers were threatening to strike and he was saying <pause dur="short"/> he probably was just misquoted <pause dur="short"/> or they'd use his quote to erm make him sound worse than he actually is</u>
<u n="16" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0084">but he was saying you know the the way to get people's attention would be to strike or to protest during the Olympics <pause dur="short"/> and everyone was up in arms <pause dur="short"/> oh my God <pause dur="short"/> can't allow this <pause dur="short"/> but since then I was reading on The Guardian I think the other day that erm other protest groups were saying that they would use the Olympics as like a focal point</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="18" who="S0083">well clearly the authorities are really worried about a terrorist attack</u>
<u n="19" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh did I tell you  has got a job in counterterrorism?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0083">oh my God</u>
<u n="21" who="S0084"><trunc>Counter</trunc> well I haven't got the full full er full description but she's moving <pause dur="short"/> so it's all in the Foreign Office</u>
<u n="22" who="S0083">mhm</u>
<u n="23" who="S0084">working in the counterterrorism department erm mainly covering the Olympics <pause dur="short"/> so it would be really interesting to find out how that's going to work <pause dur="short"/> cattle prods</u>
<u n="24" who="S0083">oh dear <pause dur="short"/> anyway <pause dur="short"/> as know there's a very simply solution</u>
<u n="25" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="26" who="S0084">I'm so bored with the Olympics</u>
<u n="27" who="S0083">well there there is that but we just need to get out of the Middle East</u>
<u n="28" who="S0084">oh I see what you mean yeah <pause dur="short"/> well that's not going to happen <pause dur="short"/> once they invade <trunc>Ir</trunc> Iran</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="29" who="S0083">oh dear</u>
<u n="30" who="S0084"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> must have got the bus</u>
<u n="31" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> she often does</u>
<u n="32" who="S0084">does she?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0083">mm</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="34" who="S0083">I think she's so tired by the end of the day</u>
<u n="35" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0083">cycling home is a real strain</u>
<u n="37" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0083">and obviously <trunc>star</trunc> you know she's she's not really a morning person erm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="40" who="S0083">but she's she comes home absolutely exhausted</u>
<u n="41" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0083">Cos she's just  she's just  standing all day <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="43" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0083">running up and down stairs all day <pause dur="short"/> well you remember what it was like</u>
<u n="45" who="S0084">I've done it</u>
<u n="46" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0084">and it is exhausting</u>
<u n="48" who="S0083">it is very very tiring yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0084">well I was thinking about this yesterday <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember whether I was I would come home and pass out for the entire evening <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I did <pause dur="short"/> I was tired <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I was as bad as her and I wonder if that's an iron <trunc>d</trunc> deficiency <pause dur="short"/> you know it's natural that you're going to be physically tired but</u>
<u n="50" who="S0083">to be as tired as she gets yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">at her age</u>
<u n="52" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="long"/> mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0084">I suppose though <pause dur="short"/> if this was <anon type="place"/> her friends were still here and had her social life and so she would go out so it would make her carry on</u>
<u n="54" who="S0083">she didn't go out that much though</u>
<u n="55" who="S0084">no but she hasn't really had the opportunity to do it here <pause dur="short"/> I think if her life was here you know she'd made friends here more than she has</u>
<u n="56" who="S0083">oh absolutely</u>
<u n="57" who="S0084">she would just go out</u>
<u n="58" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> she would go out more than she does <pause dur="short"/> that's true <pause dur="long"/> I mean the only thing is that she's managed to save a lot of money by doing this and</u>
<u n="59" who="S0084">mhm <pause dur="long"/> Absolutely</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="60" who="S0083">she always did need a lot of sleep though didn't she?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0083">I mean as a kid you did but even up to her teenage years when she was at school and college and whatever she still needed about ten hours sleep a night</u>
<u n="63" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="64" who="S0083">and people used to joke about it</u>
<u n="65" who="S0084">yeah but as we've said before she's not very good at putting on a front for people is she <pause dur="short"/> if you're you know if everybody else is tired you just muddle on through and I I feel like I spend my whole life tired <pause dur="short"/> I don't catch up with sleep at the weekend <pause dur="short"/> I'm absolutely exhausted <pause dur="short"/> it gets to Sunday and I'm still</u>
<u n="66" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> well you should <pause dur="short"/> you should try</u>
<u n="67" who="S0084">I do try</u>
<u n="68" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="69" who="S0084">I feel like I have a</u>
<u n="70" who="S0083">is the house very noisy at the weekend then?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0084">no I just wake up and I can't go back to sleep and then you know they do but they do get up early <pause dur="short"/> you know even so when I'm awake they don't wake me up necessarily but I'm I wake up early and I'm stirring so</u>
<u n="72" who="S0083">you're aware of them yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0084"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s up putting her washing on at half eight and and rooting about and</u>
<u n="74" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0084">every other weekend she and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> will work on a Saturday</u>
<u n="76" who="S0083">oh right</u>
<u n="77" who="S0084">so it's not ideal but it does do feel good</u>
<u n="78" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I suppose you're at the front <pause dur="short"/> you hear the door go don't you?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and the bikes from the bike rack from outside my window</u>
<u n="80" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0084">and all the noisy neighbours</u>
<u n="82" who="S0083">oh dear</u>
<u n="83" who="S0084">I think there's like erm a training <pause dur="short"/> like a boot camp or something cos often at sort of half five six in the morning just before I'm getting up for work during the week a group of lads will run past shouting at each other <pause dur="short"/> happens every week</u>
<u n="84" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0084">it's really annoying</u>
<u n="86" who="S0083">oh lovely</u>
<u n="87" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="long"/> So I just feel tired a lot of the time and most people do I think <pause dur="short"/> like I'm looking forward to next week so next Wednesday I think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I will go to <anon type="place"/> <trunc>dri</trunc> and leave at a reasonable time</u>
<u n="88" who="S0083">mhm</u>
<u n="89" who="S0084">and then Thursday I think  doesn't get in until the afternoon</u>
<u n="90" who="S0083">right</u>
<u n="91" who="S0084">she's got the day off but she's got a few things to do so</u>
<u n="92" who="S0083">mhm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0084">she won't get here until about three or four o'clock in the afternoon so that's really nice <pause dur="short"/> I can have a lazy day</u>
<u n="94" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0084">and I think she'll probably just stay till Friday because she's got family stuff on</u>
<u n="96" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I can imagine</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="97" who="S0084">and then I've got Saturday Sunday Monday just to catch up with sleep and potter about</u>
<u n="98" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and come over here one day</u>
<u n="99" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0083">erm <pause dur="long"/> So you aren't able to get back to sleep after that <pause dur="short"/> cos what I do find is <pause dur="short"/> I mean if it's quiet and if I'm tired and I've taken Nytol I can sometimes sleep in <pause dur="short"/> and even if I don't I'm still sleepy enough that I can go back to sleep</u>
<u n="101" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="102" who="S0083">Cos I never used to be able to do that</u>
<u n="103" who="S0084">no I can't do that</u>
<u n="104" who="S0083">but it obviously didn't help you to do that</u>
<u n="105" who="S0084">no I just lay there for about forty minutes</u>
<u n="106" who="S0083" trans="overlap">maybe take two then</u>
<u n="107" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0083">I mean I think it's fine to take two <pause dur="short"/> I just thought as you weren't used to them</u>
<u n="109" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0083">to start with one</u>
<u n="111" who="S0084">ease yourself in yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0083">you take two and just buy a packet and have it <pause dur="short"/> actually look be careful cos there are two strengths <pause dur="short"/> erm buy a packet and take take them at weekends <pause dur="short"/> see if that helps you sleep in at the weekend</u>
<u n="113" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="114" who="S0083">well it is your body clock <pause dur="short"/> cos that's what Dad was like and that's why he was always up early at weekends <pause dur="short"/> he could never sleep in</u>
<u n="115" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0083">and he was always tired and complaining and I just think for God's sake just sleep <pause dur="short"/> well he he never gave himself a <trunc>cha</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> I mean I don't know whether he would have been able to but he never gave himself a chance so once he was awake he was out of bed</u>
<u n="117" who="S0084">yeah I mean that's it <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="118" who="S0083">he would never lie there reading or try and go back to sleep <pause dur="short"/> he would just get up</u>
<u n="119" who="S0084">I mean I do lay in bed and I I think that's you know at least you can do that <pause dur="short"/> at least it's restful</u>
<u n="120" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="121" who="S0084">but I suppose if you know I used to remember getting up early and watching cartoons and stuff and he'd come down but I suppose because we were up even if we were being quiet</u>
<u n="122" who="S0083" trans="overlap">he was awake anyway</u>
<u n="123" who="S0084">yeah I know well it's not that we woke him up but I suppose he thought well if the kids are up I might as well get up <pause dur="short"/> there's no point lazing around</u>
<u n="124" who="S0083">he wanted a <pause dur="short"/> well when you were very young it was to keep an eye on you yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0084">yeah but if you think that <pause dur="short"/> sometimes I do think well you're wasting the day if you just lay around the bed when you're awake <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's nice to read or it's nice to watch a movie or read the paper or whatever but er I do think well I might as well get up</u>
<u n="126" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0084">have you know make the most of of the day</u>
<u n="128" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0084">whereas <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> could sleep <pause dur="short"/> I've never known anyone like it <pause dur="short"/> she'll come home and she'll sleep in the evening then she'll sleep all night <pause dur="short"/> she'll sleep in at the weekend you know she might sleep in at one in the afternoon <pause dur="short"/> it's unbelievable <pause dur="short"/> I mean she did go to the doctor to see if it was a thyroid thing because she was always always sleeping and she was having trouble shifting her weight like possibly from the thyroid</u>
<u n="130" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> how's her leg?</u>
<u n="131" who="S0084">the same <pause dur="short"/> all of the bruising's gone now but it's just this lump</u>
<u n="132" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0084">it's really big <pause dur="short"/> if she did say she was going to start training on it cos that's what the nurse said to do</u>
<u n="134" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0084">Cos they weren't going to drain it <pause dur="short"/> so either way just you know if it bursts then they'll have to do something about it and if it doesn't then at least it's still draining so</u>
<u n="136" who="S0083">hello <pause dur="long"/> It's very cute when you see cats washing their face like that <pause dur="short"/> it's very cute</u>
<u n="137" who="S0084">he's sleepy <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="138" who="S0083">that was a fed up sigh</u>
<u n="139" who="S0084">mm I've got toothache as well <pause dur="short"/> my wisdom teeth are coming through</u>
<u n="140" who="S0083">oh</u>
<u n="141" who="S0084">well it's this one at the moment <pause dur="short"/> this is the one that I knew was coming through and when I went to him <unclear/> One of it was for <trunc>j</trunc> before Christmas <pause dur="short"/> he said yeah it's coming through</u>
<u n="142" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0084">and I've got to get my</u>
<u n="144" who="S0083">and it's all okay?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0084">my six month coming up <pause dur="short"/> what do you mean? What coming through okay? I don't know <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't hurting before <pause dur="short"/> I could just feel it whereas it's hurting now</u>
<u n="146" who="S0083">is there room for it?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0084">well I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I think I'm going to go and speak to my orthodontist <pause dur="short"/> I've got my six month follow up in April</u>
<u n="148" who="S0083">mhm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0084">erm he might say take them out <pause dur="short"/> cos that was the question <pause dur="short"/> whether we extract them to make room for my teeth and then that would correct the over bite <pause dur="short"/> and I said no let's not bother <pause dur="short"/> at least they're straight <pause dur="short"/> if they're coming through we might have to because it sort of force the teeth out of alignment which is a bit horrendous <pause dur="short"/> I mean when people have actual operations you get sick leave from work <pause dur="short"/> I don't know whether to have your teeth extracted it would be the you'd be able to do the the same thing <pause dur="short"/> they're pretty understanding</u>
<u n="150" who="S0083">I would imagine <pause dur="short"/> cos wisdom teeth is is quite a big thing</u>
<u n="151" who="S0084" trans="overlap">is pretty serious and if they're going to do all of them <pause dur="short"/> I mean I don't <pause dur="short"/> they're coming through on the on both the back and I don't know but I can't feel the top</u>
<u n="152" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0084">I can feel <pause dur="short"/> I well I think I can feel them but I'm not sure <pause dur="short"/> if he says well I'll just whip them out <pause dur="short"/> that's going to be quite intense <pause dur="short"/> it's going to require a couple of days off work I think cos well people have <trunc>s</trunc> from what people have said it's extremely painful so</u>
<u n="154" who="S0083" trans="overlap">it is it's very painful <pause dur="short"/> it is I remember</u>

<u n="158" who="S0083">it was after I'd had one of you <pause dur="short"/> I think it was probably after I'd had Richard <pause dur="short"/> cos it was a long time ago erm they <event desc="recording skips"/> <unclear/> which I think means they'd they'd broken up</u>
<u n="159" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="160" who="S0083">and they just <event desc="recording skips"/> <unclear/> I actually had erm I had anaesthetic cos it was really bad</u>

<u n="444" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="445" who="S0084">everything is rush rush rush</u>

<u n="453" who="S0084">they're all a different <trunc>sta</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> well they're all at similar stages</u>
<u n="454" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="455" who="S0084">they're all <pause dur="short"/> because of the nature of the beast we have to publish everything on the exams list</u>

<u n="457" who="S0084">which is the list that I look after in January because that's when the schools buy the books</u>
<u n="458" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="459" who="S0084">so that means all of the courses have to come out together <pause dur="short"/> you can't stagger everything <pause dur="short"/> so you can't have one with you and then have another one and then have another one <pause dur="short"/> they've all got to come out</u>
<u n="460" who="S0083" trans="overlap">right okay yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="461" who="S0084">and at the moment they're capitalising on a  on a  segment of the market that no-one else publishes for</u>
<u n="462" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="463" who="S0084">which is called the For Schools market so it's you might have an adult version of this exam level because this is the kids version so they've gone absolutely mental</u>
<u n="464" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="465" who="S0084">basically just capitalising on the fact that they've got you know market ownership there</u>
<u n="466" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="467" who="S0084">so everything is the For Schools version of everything now and what ESOL do is they update the exams <pause dur="short"/> so we might be working on an <trunc>ex</trunc>  on a  on a project right now for a certain exam level</u>
<u n="468" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="469" who="S0084">but next year they're going to revise it and it's going to be released in twenty-fifteen so we might publish a book when everything is being published for January twenty thirteen</u>

<u n="471" who="S0084">but we're going to have to revise it almost immediately because the next version <pause dur="short"/> the second edition has got to come out in January fifteen</u>
<u n="472" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="473" who="S0084">which means the authors have to be <trunc>work</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> in the production process itself takes nine months</u>
<u n="474" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="475" who="S0084">so we're working backwards from January fifteen <pause dur="short"/> they'll have to hand it over in January fourteen which means the authors need to be working in two thousand and thirteen so that as soon as we're publishing the authors are starting work on the second edition</u>
<u n="476" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="477" who="S0084">completely ridiculous</u>
<u n="478" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="479" who="S0084">it just makes you feel like well you know you're never actually going to rest <pause dur="short"/> you're just constantly working on the same stuff</u>

<u n="481" who="S0084">you're sort of flooding the market with with its own competition</u>
<u n="482" who="S0083" trans="overlap">well you are <pause dur="short"/> why is it necessary to have a second edition so soon?</u>
<u n="483" who="S0084">because the exam is being revised <pause dur="short"/> so what we're publishing in twenty thirteen will will not be current</u>
<u n="484" who="S0083" trans="overlap">Will that have to be? Okay</u>
<u n="485" who="S0084">but we don't know <pause dur="short"/> because ESOL are just like yeah we're going to revise it but we're not going to tell you how much <pause dur="short"/> so we don't know whether it's <pause dur="short"/> if it's twenty percent new material that's fine <pause dur="short"/> well at least we've got the bare bones of what's going in</u>
<u n="486" who="S0083" trans="overlap">oh God <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="487" who="S0084">well more than the bare bones <pause dur="short"/> we'll only change twenty percent <pause dur="short"/> but they might change <trunc>eight</trunc> eighty percent which means we have to get authors to rewrite all of that material <pause dur="short"/> new exercises new examples</u>
<u n="488" who="S0083" trans="overlap">for God's sake why would you need to constantly <trunc>re</trunc> revise <unclear/> exam?</u>
<u n="489" who="S0084" trans="overlap">er it's almost like they're just creating work for themselves for the sake of it</u>
<u n="490" who="S0083">no you wonder <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="491" who="S0084">you know if it's been perfectly good up till this point why do they need to keep revising it? I don't know <pause dur="short"/> you know that's not <pause dur="short"/> I'm not in charge of the content <pause dur="short"/> I'm in charge of getting it out on time</u>

<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="495" who="S0083">I suppose erm er what am I trying to say?</u>
<u n="496" who="S0084">well if you thinking about publishing a book <pause dur="short"/> we would bring out new editions because the material looks dated <pause dur="short"/> so current pop stars that we might include with current illustrations <pause dur="short"/> and the book dates that's that's <trunc>ou</trunc> they're</u>
<u n="497" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> but that's  that's only  that's only minor though isn't it?</u>
<u n="498" who="S0084">well yeah it's pretty <pause dur="short"/> it depends how long ago the last edition was published</u>
<u n="499" who="S0083">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="500" who="S0084">if you've got something that's not a massive seller <pause dur="short"/> your last edition might have been for seven years ago for example something that I'm working on now <pause dur="short"/> business Title <pause dur="short"/> it's a business exams title</u>
<u n="501" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="502" who="S0084">it was last published in twenty <pause dur="short"/> two thousand and four erm which means it wasn't even designed in the current design programme</u>

<u n="504" who="S0084">it was in Quark rather than InDesign</u>
<u n="505" who="S0083">oh right</u>
<u n="506" who="S0084">so you've got to get all the old files from <unclear/> convert them <pause dur="short"/> send them off to the type setter so that they can work from that</u>
<u n="507" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="508" who="S0084">but basically we're changing eighty percent of the content</u>
<u n="509" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="510" who="S0084">so it's it's it's massive</u>
<u n="511" who="S0083">it is isn't it</u>
<u n="512" who="S0084">and then you've got things like for that you've got two business exams and they publish a student's book for each in this project</u>
<u n="513" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="514" who="S0084">so you've got one for Business English it's called and then one for Business <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember what the other one is <pause dur="short"/> anyway</u>
<u n="515" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="516" who="S0084">we've got two exams <pause dur="short"/> so you've got two student's books per level <pause dur="short"/> you've got erm a study book for the students and you've got a teacher's for the teachers</u>

<u n="520" who="S0084">but there's also also authentic recordings so like this <pause dur="short"/> basically you and me just chatting or interviews that's got to be spliced into the audio recording</u>

<u n="522" who="S0084">it's it's that that makes your job quite interesting because because that's what I have to do <pause dur="short"/> I have to make sure that all of those pieces are there</u>

<u n="605" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="606" who="S0084">and the good thing is because we have so many new systems all learning all the time so that was the hardest thing about starting in November was because it <trunc>w</trunc> that was basically when we were starting a new system so they were trying to show me the old way but show me the new way and it was all very confusing so erm I think that's put me in quite a fortunate position because I've just run with the new system because there's no point learning the old one</u>
<u n="607" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="608" who="S0084">whereas I think the others have had a lot longer to be working the old system and they're finding it a bit difficult to move across so</u>
<u n="609" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="610" who="S0084">for example yesterday I spent time with one of the seniors showing them how to use the new scheduling system</u>

<u n="618" who="S0084">it's sink or swim <pause dur="short"/> definitely <pause dur="short"/> I mean that's what they said when I went for my interview <pause dur="short"/> I mean well <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was saying when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> my colleague that started as the trainee two years ago <pause dur="short"/> when I started my job with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> he'd started a month before <pause dur="short"/> and she said you know he was quite fortunate at the time because there was fewer projects in the department going through production and he had smaller projects and he could take his time and she said you don't have that luxury you know</u>

<u n="638" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> I think that was it you know <pause dur="short"/> it took me a few years to get there but was it's all quite crucial timing you know it's you need that time when you're finishing to just take stock and think what it is that you want to do <pause dur="short"/> it does take a while</u>
<u n="639" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="640" who="S0084">well certainly once I'd latched onto it or when I started the course it really felt like yeah this is it <pause dur="short"/> this is  this is  what I want to do so</u>
<u n="641" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> I mean it it wasn't just I mean that that was clear <pause dur="short"/> that was very clear <pause dur="short"/> and I was very glad that you'd found that</u>
<u n="642" who="S0084" trans="overlap">and it's probably felt like that ever since</u>

<u n="644" who="S0084">I didn't really like academic work</u>
<u n="645" who="S0083">when  when you  when you had a project from school <pause dur="short"/> even if it was something that you enjoyed it was like oh it's too hard <pause dur="short"/> oh it's too much work <pause dur="short"/> oh no I <pause dur="short"/> oh it's just too much</u>
<u n="646" who="S0084" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah complete opposite to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>in that regard <pause dur="short"/> well I think  that was  that was why <pause dur="short"/> I think it had taken me that long till my mid twenties to think <pause dur="short"/> actually I want to go to university <pause dur="short"/> I want to study</u>
<u n="647" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="648" who="S0084">and I think that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> when I was eighteen it was sort of well you've got <trunc>y</trunc> you go <pause dur="short"/> that's what you're supposed to do</u>
<u n="649" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="650" who="S0084">as opposed to a necessarily a real choice to go <pause dur="short"/> you know I wanted to go but I don't think studying was the the drive for me then at all</u>
<u n="651" who="S0083" trans="overlap">no no it absolutely wasn't</u>
<u n="652" who="S0084">and er that was apparent <pause dur="short"/> I think when I went to do my MA that was the drive that was right okay well this is my chance to prove to myself and and maybe to other people that I can do it <pause dur="short"/> I have got a brain <pause dur="short"/> I can study and I can apply myself <pause dur="short"/> and I felt like I'd been given that opportunity and not to waste it really</u>
<u n="653" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> well you and that was the other thing <pause dur="short"/> it was all your choice</u>
<u n="654" who="S0084">yeah I think that was the difference <pause dur="short"/> it was my course <pause dur="short"/> it was my university <pause dur="short"/> I'd researched it <pause dur="short"/> I wanted to do it</u>
<u n="655" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="656" who="S0084">erm whereas I think I just you know with U E A <pause dur="short"/> I think said this is like a good uni <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah okay fine mum <pause dur="short"/> well this is like a good course <pause dur="short"/> yeah fine okay</u>
<u n="657" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="658" who="S0084">and I hadn't really engaged with any of it other than well erm I should go to uni it sounds good</u>
<u n="659" who="S0083" trans="overlap">well no I mean you you you said you wanted to do film</u>
<u n="660" who="S0084">yeah but do you remember I started doing cultural studies?</u>
<u n="661" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="662" who="S0084">and I think that was your drive <pause dur="short"/> that was your <unclear/></u>
<u n="663" who="S0083" trans="overlap">because because no <pause dur="short"/> it it I the reason I suggested that was because it was a broad canvas because  there was  there was no one field that you wanted to do</u>
<u n="664" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> absolutely</u>
<u n="665" who="S0083">and it seemed like <pause dur="short"/> well if it  if it's  if it's a sort of if it's a different bit every week or every other week that would suit you more</u>
<u n="666" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah absolutely yeah <pause dur="short"/> it seemed like a good idea and I think that's what <pause dur="short"/> you know I didn't challenge it because I thought well <unclear/> that makes sense because there wasn't anything that I wanted to do <pause dur="short"/> so what I probably should have done is wait and then gone when I was twenty-five</u>
<u n="667" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> the thing is I knew I I had this feeling and I still think it that had you worked for a year or travelled or you know</u>
<u n="668" who="S0084" trans="overlap">I wouldn't go</u>
<u n="669" who="S0083">had you worked saved travelled that at the end of it you wouldn't have gone to uni</u>
<u n="670" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and if that was the case then that would have you know well my life would have just gone in a different direction</u>
<u n="671" who="S0083" trans="overlap">and I was  I was I was  worried that that would happen to you <pause dur="short"/> yeah and you would have done and you wouldn't be where you are so</u>
<u n="672" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I mean if you think that I was twenty-five when I started my MA and I thought and it had taken me that long to get there and choose to do that <pause dur="short"/> I would have been behind because I would have been doing my undergraduate then as opposed to my MA so I'd only been now <pause dur="short"/> only now would I be finishing my MA</u>
<u n="673" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah you would have been way behind <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="674" who="S0084"><unclear/> that yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I finished my MA three years ago didn't I so yeah</u>
<u n="675" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah you might have yeah</u>

<u n="677" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="678" who="S0084">so erm so yeah I'd be well behind <pause dur="short"/> and I <trunc>f</trunc> because that's part of what you feel you know you're thirty and you're a trainee you think you know this isn't quite how what my life was planned</u>
<u n="679" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I know but you've done all of the stuff that you have</u>
<u n="680" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well you know I have travelled <pause dur="short"/> I have got two degrees <pause dur="short"/> I have I am in a job that I enjoy and I'm in an area a field that I enjoy so</u>
<u n="681" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and you've been there for two years and you've you've you've settled and well thought of there</u>
<u n="682" who="S0084">yeah I think so <pause dur="short"/> I hope so</u>
<u n="683" who="S0083" trans="overlap">well you obviously are</u>

<u n="685" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> you are</u>
<u n="686" who="S0084">so it's funny <pause dur="short"/> it's funny <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>pe</trunc> yeah I mean I do <pause dur="short"/> I definitely do prefer to busy at work</u>
<u n="687" who="S0083" trans="overlap">you you do <pause dur="short"/> you do <pause dur="short"/> and it and and this is the thing <pause dur="short"/> it's like I don't recognise this confident mature capable young woman with with with the teenager who used to <pause dur="short"/> erm I don't know</u>
<u n="688" who="S0084">I'm very different to how I was when I was a teen <pause dur="short"/> I mean I still see traits of myself obviously <pause dur="short"/> you know I am still quite shy and</u>
<u n="689" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="690" who="S0084">I still do have a confidence issues to a degree but at the same time I'm much more self assured obviously which is what's supposed to happen</u>
<u n="691" who="S0083" trans="overlap">you are</u>
<u n="692" who="S0084">you are supposed to be more self assured when you're older but</u>

<u n="695" who="S0083">no it doesn't</u>
<u n="696" who="S0084">and everyone has you know issues about themselves</u>
<u n="697" who="S0083" trans="overlap">and you're very clear about what you want whereas when you were a teenager you you didn't know <pause dur="short"/> erm and you just liked doing the things that you liked doing</u>
<u n="698" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="699" who="S0083">and you didn't put yourself out at all</u>
<u n="700" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="701" who="S0083">whereas now you do</u>
<u n="702" who="S0084">well I suppose you know it's it's meeting people it's doing things that test who you are as a person and</u>
<u n="703" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="704" who="S0084">if you I suppose in every situation</u>
<u n="705" who="S0083" trans="overlap">you have pushed yourself <pause dur="short"/> you have you've I think that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> you you've you've wanted to do certain things and you've made yourself do them</u>

<u n="707" who="S0083">instead of thinking oh I'd really like to do that but I never could <pause dur="short"/> you thought I really want to do that <pause dur="short"/> right now erm I'm going to erm book this and save that and go there and you you've done it</u>
<u n="708" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> to a degree yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's obviously there's always more</u>

<u n="710" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="711" who="S0083">and that's the difference because a teenager would have said I'd like to do that but that's not going to happen</u>
<u n="712" who="S0084">well I lived in a safety net <trunc>do</trunc> you know  when you're  when you're living at home you know it's all very easy and very safe and you're parents look after you and as soon as you move out you're on your own and that first few years is a real test</u>
<u n="713" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> but that that's I think that's what made the difference  which is  which is I mean beyond anything obviously the education but I think that's what <trunc>mo</trunc>going to uni did for you</u>

<u n="715" who="S0083">it made you think you could do anything and you did</u>
<u n="716" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it does <pause dur="short"/> and and meeting other people because obviously growing up you see the same people day in day out <pause dur="short"/> I mean there's no-one new <pause dur="short"/> there's new thought really <pause dur="short"/> everyone's doing the same thing and</u>

<u n="800" who="S0084">maybe that's how I've always been I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I think  I think  that's something that comes with age and confidence I think <pause dur="short"/> like not necessarily being you know being open to other people's ideas but I think I am no that's not right <pause dur="short"/> this is what I think</u>
<u n="801" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="802" who="S0084">and I I'm aware of that <pause dur="short"/> I try not to be but I think if someone says something that I don't agree with I'd say what are you talking about? That's not the case <pause dur="short"/> it's like this and but then I think you know check yourself</u>
<u n="803" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> the more you mix with people and lots of different people with as you say different backgrounds different views erm <pause dur="short"/> <event desc="sound of sneezing"/></u>
<u n="804" who="S0084">bless you <pause dur="short"/> bless you</u>
<u n="805" who="S0083">oh dear <pause dur="short"/> right okay <pause dur="short"/> erm I thought there was another one coming <pause dur="short"/> erm You have  you have  to deal with the fact that there are lots of different views and opinions in the world and some are obviously just wrong</u>
<u n="806" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="807" who="S0083">but it also it helps you to crystallise your own ideas you know <trunc>wh</trunc> when when you hear different views you have to take those views on board and then you you kind of you you know so you you're constantly</u>
<u n="808" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah you compare them to what you believe and and question what you believe</u>
<u n="809" who="S0083" trans="overlap">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> and it therefore makes you think about what it is you believe and so it either er confirms it or it might challenge it and you think oh well I hadn't thought of things like that so</u>
<u n="810" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah challenges it <pause dur="short"/> absolutely yeah</u>
<u n="811" who="S0083">so the more you mix the more you talk <pause dur="short"/> it erm I think  I think  it's it's all a help because it will  it will  it helps your thinking about your own views</u>
<u n="812" who="S0084" trans="overlap">it's a good thing yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's just remembering to be open to those views</u>
<u n="813" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="814" who="S0084">not necessarily shoot them down</u>
<u n="815" who="S0083">but not <pause dur="short"/> yes just just as a  as a  knee jerk reaction but also you know not to just take on other people's views because it's somebody else and you think oh they're much cleverer than me you know</u>
<u n="816" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="817" who="S0083">I mean which is  which is  you know the other thing that can happen so</u>
<u n="818" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="819" who="S0083">but it  but it  helps <pause dur="short"/> in some ways it doesn't help when when you're all the same and you're all thinking and doing the same thing and that's not terribly healthy I think <pause dur="short"/> it's like  it's like  living in one community where you you know there's just one world view <pause dur="short"/> I mean that's where racism starts because you are with your own kind and anyone who's different is therefore seen as dangerous or erm or a difference is seen as a threat</u>

<u n="821" who="S0083">the more we mix with you know all the differences that you know of opinion of culture of background the better for all of us I think</u>
<u n="822" who="S0084">absolutely yeah</u>
<u n="823" who="S0083">but I think that's the problem <pause dur="short"/> I think people do <trunc>le</trunc> live in their little enclaves you know erm and they see different difference as frightening <pause dur="short"/> as a threat</u>
<u n="824" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> a bad thing <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="825" who="S0083">rather than welcoming it and and enjoying it <pause dur="short"/> appreciating it <pause dur="short"/> learning from it <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't mean that you have to give up your own identity <pause dur="short"/> this is  this is  what I you know they never</u>
<u n="826" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="827" who="S0083">you know that's not what's required <pause dur="short"/> and I think they're worried that <trunc>i</trunc> that it is</u>
<u n="828" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="829" who="S0083">anyway <pause dur="short"/> sorry to bang on <pause dur="short"/> but I think I think just generally it's healthy er for all of us to to challenge our own views</u>
<u n="830" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="831" who="S0083">because often it will confirm them as well</u>
<u n="832" who="S0084">yeah yeah yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="833" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I mean you know you realise that actually yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was  I was I was  on on track there because that's that's clearly the best way and the best way forward</u>
<u n="834" who="S0084" trans="overlap">I think that's right yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="835" who="S0083">but we do get very stuck in our ways of thinking</u>
<u n="836" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's it if you spend all of your time with one type of person <pause dur="short"/> one group of people then yeah you do</u>
<u n="837" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> or just in your own head all the time you know you're not challenging it <pause dur="short"/> you know you're not having else coming in</u>
<u n="838" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="839" who="S0083">erm no other views <pause dur="short"/> no other input from anywhere <pause dur="short"/> I mean that's why we read and we talk and we listen and we you know because that's it isn't it I mean</u>
<u n="840" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="841" who="S0083">the discussion of ideas the the the the free flow of ideas between people is is what has made us and and what will continue to make us a good society</u>
<u n="842" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> like The Enlightenment</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="843" who="S0083">well that was I mean that just reminds me of mum because it was it's like she decided this is what she believed and that was that and she wasn't interested in anything <pause dur="short"/> yep a lot of people are like that <pause dur="short"/> a lot of right wing are terribly this is their view of the world and you're not going to move them</u>
<u n="844" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah well it's it's putting up barriers to other thoughts <pause dur="short"/> it's it's some sort of patronising erm way of speaking to people</u>
<u n="845" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> it is</u>
<u n="846" who="S0084">erm no dear that's not what we think this is what we think <pause dur="short"/> parrot fashion</u>
<u n="847" who="S0083" trans="overlap">because it's it's it's their sense of superiority</u>
<u n="848" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="849" who="S0083">and it's it's a  it's a  putting down of erm you know other classes other cultures as as being inferior to theirs</u>
<u n="850" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="851" who="S0083">and and not allowing anything to challenge that because if you challenge that you will see weaknesses in that and you have to accept other things as being important or right</u>
<u n="852" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="853" who="S0083">and they you know it's it's it's not wanting to allow that to happen I think</u>
<u n="854" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="855" who="S0083">so you cling on to your view and you don't  you don't  allow any anything to challenge that <pause dur="short"/> and you're not like that <pause dur="short"/> you are you you just you have strong views in the same  in the same  way that a lot of us do about what's important <pause dur="short"/> about what's right</u>
<u n="856" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="857" who="S0083">I don't think you're closed <pause dur="short"/> I don't think you're</u>
<u n="858" who="S0084">I don't think I'm closed I think I'm</u>
<u n="859" who="S0083">I think you just I think you know at having got to the age that you have and done the things that you've done I think you realise certain things are important and and you you're not shy about saying that</u>
<u n="860" who="S0084">yeah I'm I'm aware of my own values and and my core values and what I think is important</u>
<u n="861" who="S0083" trans="overlap">well that's fine</u>
<u n="862" who="S0084">yeah but I try not to  I try not to  judge too quickly but I guess we're all a bit guilty of that</u>
<u n="863" who="S0083">well exactly we <trunc>ca</trunc> we can all do that</u>
<u n="864" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="865" who="S0083">oh you're beating yourself up a bit this morning <pause dur="short"/> don't do that</u>
<u n="866" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> no no no it's sort of just self reflection isn't it?</u>
<u n="867" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> well again that's an incredibly important thing to do <pause dur="short"/> it I mean we all can take it too far</u>
<u n="868" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="869" who="S0083">but it's a very important thing to <pause dur="short"/> people who don't that I think are people you just don't want to be with <pause dur="short"/> you don't want to be around them</u>
<u n="870" who="S0084">well I think people that don't have got something to hide from themselves haven't they because why don't they want to look inside</u>
<u n="871" who="S0083" trans="overlap">if people <pause dur="short"/> it's too dangerous <pause dur="short"/> it's too scary</u>
<u n="872" who="S0084">it's yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's something buried there</u>

<u n="875" who="S0083">it it allows doubt <pause dur="short"/> I mean that's the thing you know <pause dur="short"/> you can't allow <pause dur="short"/> if you've got very strict erm er very rigid views</u>
<u n="876" who="S0084">yeah</u>

<u n="878" who="S0084"><event desc="sound of yawning"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> like the right wingers</u>
<u n="879" who="S0083">I mean I I think that's a very  a very  good saying erm no let me get it right <pause dur="short"/> the most dangerous person in the world is is the person who knows that they're right</u>
<u n="880" who="S0084">oh that's interesting</u>
<u n="881" who="S0083">I think that's that's because if you know you're right if you have no doubt at all knowing you are right <pause dur="short"/> I mean that makes you dangerous because you are capable of doing anything because you know you are right</u>
<u n="882" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm mm</u>

<u n="893" who="S0083">that about which they know they are right</u>
<u n="894" who="S0084">I mean I don't want to you know compare Blair to Hitler but Blair thought Blair knew he was right</u>
<u n="895" who="S0083" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> absolutely and that made him very dangerous because he would do anything</u>

<u n="1257" who="S0084" trans="overlap">that's his isn't it?</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0083">anyway he turned it into a a you know a completely kind of sustainable house <pause dur="short"/> I mean even even things like cos I mean cos people were horrified at the time but it's it's really good way of doing it</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0084" trans="overlap">really?</u>
<u n="1260" who="S0083">erm the waste systems <pause dur="short"/> you know all the plumbing and the waste from the house erm rather than go into the the main sewerage system erm they they built a series of reed beds which filter and cleans water <pause dur="short"/> it's a completely natural way of</u>

<u n="1264" who="S0083">and I thought well that's really good <pause dur="short"/> I mean obviously you need the money to do it but</u>
<u n="1265" who="S0084">oh absolutely</u>
<u n="1266" who="S0083">but at least he's doing so fair enough</u>
<u n="1267" who="S0084">it's a good model for <unclear/></u>

<u n="1270" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1271" who="S0084">I think I remember reading in the paper that Blair at the time was quite would get frustrated with him because he would try and get involved in politics and it's all like that's a bit of  bit of  a no no in this day and age but to have someone take an interest in the monarchy is is important I think you know they are supposed to be the head of our  of our  country whether that's in name only which it essentially is</u>
<u n="1272" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> it is <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1273" who="S0084">but they should be <pause dur="short"/> they should know what's going on <pause dur="short"/> they should be involved in the policy making <pause dur="short"/> you know this is completely ridiculous if they've got to go and ask the Queen if they can form a government but actually she's go no say in what the laws are</u>
<u n="1274" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> well that's pretty much how it is</u>
<u n="1275" who="S0084">well absolutely and and there's reasons for that I mean look at our history but still if you're going to have a monarchy have them involved or don't have one</u>
<u n="1276" who="S0083" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1277" who="S0084">this whole pretence it's very very strange</u>

<u n="1279" who="S0084">this black rod knocking on the House of Commons and</u>
<u n="1280" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I know and that's why it gets frustrating because you think well what are we paying them to do? And it's it's billions</u>

<u n="1282" who="S0083">you know</u>

<u n="1284" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I think that's it <pause dur="short"/> I think people just like it</u>
<u n="1285" who="S0084">it's it's historic you know</u>
<u n="1286" who="S0083">I I don't know what it is <pause dur="short"/> erm because  was trying to work this out and and she just came to the conclusion that it's it's just something people like <pause dur="short"/> it's nice</u>
<u n="1287" who="S0084">it's nice</u>
<u n="1288" who="S0083">it has no no real value</u>

<u n="1290" who="S0083" trans="overlap">but but oh well that's what people say I mean I don't know</u>
<u n="1291" who="S0084">well look at the wedding last year <pause dur="short"/> look at the Jubilee <pause dur="short"/> people flood to the UK <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>m</trunc> particularly er you know countries in the Commonwealth</u>

<u n="1294" who="S0083" trans="overlap">it is weird isn't it?</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0084">I mean if you look at countries that are obsessed with British culture <pause dur="short"/> you know in Japan they've got erm they've got their own Globe built <pause dur="short"/> they've got their own mini Stratford-upon-Avon built <pause dur="short"/> you know they love <pause dur="short"/> they go <trunc>ma</trunc> mad for it and in terms of money that's it's very lucrative</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0083" trans="overlap">it's so strange isn't it</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0084">it's a big it's big money spinner for the UK</u>
<u n="1298" who="S0083">I suppose that's that's how</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0084">and that's part of the reason for having the Olympics here <pause dur="short"/> it's bringing people here <pause dur="short"/> it's making people aware of what's going on and it's providing jobs for people this year you know providing work for people</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0084">obviously by September they'll be out of work but at a time when there are few jobs then</u>

<u n="1303" who="S0084">I don't understand it <pause dur="short"/> I mean it is billions is it almost a billion pounds isn't it</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0083" trans="overlap">but it's I think more than that it's it's the money that's being poured into an area of London that that needed it but it's not the people who actually live there that will benefit from it</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>abso</trunc> well it's the rich people who will come in and buy all the houses and up the rent</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0083">yeah and that's what they're that's what's happening</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0084">it will drive people out into into the slums because that's the area that people could afford to live in</u>
