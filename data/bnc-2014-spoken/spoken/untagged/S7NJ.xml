<u n="139" who="S0589"><unclear/></u>
<u n="140" who="S0588"><unclear/> not too much I'm already learning I've got enough on my plate with geography lessons</u>
<u n="141" who="S0589" trans="overlap">oh let's shall I teach you how to play mancala?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0588">yeah okay oh that's probably ours did we give that away?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0589">no well <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> borrowed it and never brought it back</u>
<u n="144" who="S0588">is this a game that uses your brain?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0589">yeah but I've never quite worked out how</u>
<u n="146" who="S0588">is it it's er it's a bit boring otherwise if it doesn't <pause dur="short"/> er I want brain exercise</u>
<u n="147" who="S0589">okay so let me try and just think how you play it you pick up any one you like <pause dur="short"/> and then you put one <pause dur="short"/> in each thing <pause dur="short"/> and at the end of the game you see how many people how and it's over when you've freed up your whole thing and you've got nothing left I think that's right but here's a particular thing say you pick up this and you go one two and it's your last one and it goes opposite in an empty one you capture all of those</u>
<u n="148" who="S0588">and what's the object of the game?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0589">to have most things in here</u>
<u n="150" who="S0588">to have all these things in one of these holes?</u>
<u n="151" who="S0589" trans="overlap">yeah we'll just play it and then you'll pick it up</u>
<u n="152" who="S0588" trans="overlap">in there</u>
<u n="153" who="S0589">just help me put four in each again <pause dur="long"/> okay you may start</u>
<u n="154" who="S0588">do I have to start in any particular place?</u>
<u n="155" who="S0589">going <trunc>clockw</trunc>clockwise no start where you like oh hang on if you end like this if your last one goes in there you get another go</u>
<u n="156" who="S0588">can you work that out or is that</u>
<u n="157" who="S0589" trans="overlap">well yeah cos it's</u>
<u n="158" who="S0588" trans="overlap">is it more random than that?</u>
<u n="159" who="S0589" trans="overlap">it's easy now cos you know there's four and that's one two three four and you'd get another go later on when there's loads it's difficult to work out</u>
<u n="160" who="S0588">I'll do that then</u>
<u n="161" who="S0589">so one <trunc>ea</trunc> there's one on each step this is called Mancala really and it can be played on the beach with just stones with</u>
<u n="162" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it's pretty boring</u>
<u n="163" who="S0589">well how do you know? you've only gone once</u>
<u n="164" who="S0588" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="165" who="S0589">your go</u>
<u n="166" who="S0588">er where do I pick up from now?</u>
<u n="167" who="S0589">anywhere on your side of the board</u>
<u n="168" who="S0588">anywhere I want?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0589">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0588">it isn't going in order then?</u>
<u n="171" who="S0589">no you can do what you want <pause dur="long"/> sorry what's the object again?</u>
<u n="172" who="S0588">just to get as many stuck in here as you can <pause dur="short"/> just play and it'll make sense as you go along</u>
<u n="173" who="S0589" trans="overlap">and how do you how do you get them in there again?</u>
<u n="174" who="S0588">every time you go past it you drop one off in there <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0589">also I should point out when you're finished you get every all the ones that a other person has left that's important to remember all so I can do the same as you look <pause dur="short"/> one two three four I get another go <pause dur="short"/> four four <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="176" who="S0588">can I pick up one of these?</u>
<u n="177" who="S0589">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0588">do what you want</u>
<u n="179" who="S0589" trans="overlap">any of these?</u>
<u n="180" who="S0588">oh then I wouldn't go very far there either what was that opposite thing again?</u>
<u n="181" who="S0589">put it into one if I were to end up with one there I'd capture your one opposite</u>
<u n="182" who="S0588">can't I oh <pause dur="short"/> but you could oh no that's yours <vocal desc="laugh"/> right I don't there's strategy but I'm not knowing it</u>
<u n="183" who="S0589" trans="overlap">it won't become clear until you know how it works so we'll just rush through this first <pause dur="long"/> cos I've kind of forgotten too</u>
<u n="184" who="S0588">so far it's very boring</u>
<u n="185" who="S0589"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh no next stop right you could capture loads by doing a move <pause dur="short"/> so if the last one is a empty one you capture everything opposite so it so there's two moves you can make to effect that <pause dur="long"/> no three <pause dur="short"/> no you've <unclear/></u>
<u n="186" who="S0588">er? I've got those</u>
<u n="187" who="S0589">no but if you'd gone one you would have won all this</u>
<u n="188" who="S0588">I have <trunc>o</trunc> got one there</u>
<u n="189" who="S0589">no no the last one the last that you put down</u>
<u n="190" who="S0588">oh</u>
<u n="191" who="S0589">fills an empty one and you you capture</u>
<u n="192" who="S0588" trans="overlap">the last one you put there?</u>
<u n="193" who="S0589">you capture everything on this side</u>
<u n="194" who="S0588">oh</u>
<u n="195" who="S0589">too late <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="196" who="S0588">this is stupid</u>
