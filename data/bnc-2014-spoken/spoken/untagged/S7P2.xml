<u n="34" who="S0510">the the one about Room with a View?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0509" trans="overlap">it's like a thousand words yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0510">well what's the premise of the essay then?</u>
<u n="37" who="S0509">I've got to talk about the main character Lucy</u>
<u n="38" who="S0510">oh right okay</u>
<u n="39" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0510">didn't you do an essay on room with a view before?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0509">no</u>
<u n="42" who="S0510">what was the one you had to do in the holidays before you actually started the course?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0509" trans="overlap">oh yeah well that wasn't it was a little bit on the first chapter but it wasn't much of an essay</u>
<u n="44" who="S0510" trans="overlap">oh right just a little taster</u>
<u n="45" who="S0509">yeah</u>
<u n="46" who="S0510">yeah mm well you kind of enjoy all of that analysis stuff once you get into it don't you?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0510">I guess it's a</u>
<u n="49" who="S0509">it'll just be a bit of a long slog</u>
<u n="50" who="S0510">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="52" who="S0509">but erm what was I going to say? oh yeah I got my erm my drama grades back for my induction tasks so I got erm Bs and Cs which is fine and <unclear/> like I did this</u>
<u n="53" who="S0510" trans="overlap">great</u>
<u n="54" who="S0509">the the essay that I did I got a B in and she said that she had like she had no concerns about getting my written work up to an A and she said she thinks</u>
<u n="55" who="S0510" trans="overlap">terrific</u>
<u n="56" who="S0509">we can get my cos obviously my target grade is an A</u>
<u n="57" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0509">she said that she thinks she <trunc>ca</trunc> we can get my practical work up to an A as well but I will need to really work for that and I was like oh I'm willing to do that yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0510" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0509" trans="overlap">but erm yeah she was talking about a thing called to heightened naturalism which she thinks I'm suited to and which I think I'm suited to which is</u>
<u n="61" who="S0510"><foreign lang="spa">que</foreign>?</u>
<u n="62" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0509">it's a style of acting isn't worth explaining it</u>
<u n="64" who="S0510">alright so what? naturalistic but sort of a bit caricature?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0509">no</u>
<u n="66" who="S0510" trans="overlap"><trunc>heigh</trunc> the heightened bit or not?</u>
<u n="67" who="S0509">no not really cos caricature is the opposite of naturalism so</u>
<u n="68" who="S0510">well I guess so yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="71" who="S0509"><trunc>natura</trunc> heightened naturalism</u>
<u n="72" who="S0510" trans="overlap">that was a bit of a dichotomy there</u>
<u n="73" who="S0509">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0509">you know <trunc>nat</trunc>naturalism would just be like acting how you would naturally respond to a situation</u>
<u n="76" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm hm yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0509">heightened naturalism you kind of take <pause dur="short"/> erm certain eh naturalistic aspects of your character</u>
<u n="78" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0509">and you kind of instead of trying to portray a more a a character with loads of depth you take the kind of important bits of them and portray those naturalistically</u>
<u n="80" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="81" who="S0509">and like the Rebecca that we went to see that was kind of heightened naturalism</u>
<u n="82" who="S0510">ah okay</u>
<u n="83" who="S0509" trans="overlap">cos it it was kind of naturalistic in it in the way that it served the story and it was a naturalistic story and sort of it it wasn't always sort of oh pantomime or whatever obviously there were bits with like physical theatre and that which aren't naturalistic</u>
<u n="84" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0509">but their voice and that wasn't unnaturalistic</u>
<u n="86" who="S0510">mm hm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0509">but it wasn't really naturalism cos it didn't really like feel empathy for the characters that make sense?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="89" who="S0509">it's it's yeah <trunc>ob</trunc> I I get the feeling you maybe don't quite get it but</u>
<u n="90" who="S0510">no I'm just thinking further really and deeper I suppose just you know? thinking about most things that you see you know? be in in terms of a stage play or you know? a TV series or whatever aren't they all going for a naturalistic approach because they're trying to erm convey something naturally rather than you know <vocal desc="misc"/> any other way really so it it it it kind of</u>
<u n="91" who="S0509"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0510"><trunc>h</trunc> <trunc>h</trunc> I mean am I wrong or <trunc>wh</trunc> what?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0509">naturalism is the predominant style but you you probably in in TV it definitely is</u>
<u n="94" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah aha</u>
<u n="95" who="S0509">but then you've got melodrama and things which you have on TV and you have comedy things which aren't done naturalistically cos it's overplayed and eh archetypal</u>
<u n="96" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0509">and then lots of theatre is non-naturalistic and there's lots of theatre styles that you probably don't see very often but they do exist and might have been bigger in their time</u>
<u n="98" who="S0510">right okay</u>
<u n="99" who="S0509">but yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0510">in yeah I <trunc>sup</trunc> I guess what I'm saying is is that not like the baseline anyway? naturalistic okay I get what you're saying about different styles like comedy you know? where you're going to</u>
<u n="101" who="S0509" trans="overlap">no yeah no but do you remember me telling you about Berkoff?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0509">yeah and that's like <trunc>com</trunc> there's stuff like that that's just completely different from naturalism</u>
<u n="104" who="S0510">mm mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0509">it's just yeah cos it's all about the way you in which you choose to portray a message and at the moment naturalism is how they normally do it probably cos it's the easiest as well</u>
<u n="106" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah cos it's what you we all relate to it's it's our everyday isn't it?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah yeah but some of the other ones are more interesting erm yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="109" who="S0509">cos I had to write an essay comparing Stanislavsky who sort of erm created the most rigorous er acting system for naturalism and Berkoff who did total theatre which is all the very different one</u>
<u n="110" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0509">and I had to kind of cos Berkoff is trying to portray a message by just erm I can't explain it but by unseating you and and cos the thing with naturalism it's</u>
<u n="112" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0509">it is the stuff you see everyday</u>
<u n="114" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0509">whereas Berkoff is like so different from what you see <trunc>everyb</trunc> day</u>
<u n="116" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0509">but not necessarily then untrue</u>
<u n="118" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="119" who="S0509">it's not untrue it's just</u>
<u n="120" who="S0510" trans="overlap">right mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0509">it can be more representative of within yourself</u>
<u n="122" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="123" who="S0509">and how and like how</u>
<u n="124" who="S0510">hm yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0509">you can combine kind of the meaning of what you're saying</u>
<u n="126" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0509">not just through what you're saying but how you say it</u>
<u n="128" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0509">it like the tone and the pitch and all these other things</u>
<u n="130" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0509">and that because that's kind of unseating and is more within</u>
<u n="132" who="S0510">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0509">it it can portray a message even better sometimes</u>
<u n="134" who="S0510">sure yeah I guess that's the thing as well thinking about it with with naturalism you know? <trunc>ho</trunc> our everyday whatever we only put on the face that we want other people to see and what is sort of like the socially constructed sort of norms of the day and how you should behave and all the rest of it and we kind of almost put it through a filter if you like before it comes out of our head you know? whereas</u>
<u n="135" who="S0509" trans="overlap">aha</u>
<u n="136" who="S0510">it in I don't know whether Berkoff focuses on this or whether I'm completely off the mark but you know in order for me to be having this conversation with you in the in between bits I will have been thinking certain things</u>
<u n="137" who="S0509">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0510">that you may never hear but they may be completely crazy and off the wall and</u>
<u n="139" who="S0509">yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0510">or I might be suppressing stuff that you don't actually get to hear or or see</u>
<u n="141" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> berkoff isn't quite like that although there probably is a style like that</u>
<u n="142" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0509">cos there's other styles and there's another type of theatre I think it's Brecht</u>
<u n="144" who="S0510">oh yeah that name rings a bell yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0509" trans="overlap">oh really? erm and that is all about erm highlighting the <unclear>machinations</unclear> of the theatre and revealing to you you know? <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> the <trunc>dis</trunc>disillusioning you and just <trunc>y</trunc>you will see er props and erm costumes changes will take place onstage in your full view</u>
<u n="146" who="S0510">oh okay</u>
<u n="147" who="S0509">and er the lighting will just be harsh and brighten up into <trunc>distr</trunc> distraction and that all the way through</u>
<u n="148" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0509">scene changes will happen with like full lighting on</u>
<u n="150" who="S0510">so more revealing of the inner? yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah <trunc>o</trunc>of theatre and kind of disconnecting you then</u>
<u n="152" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0509">and sort of showing you that it's all an illusion which is another interesting one</u>
<u n="154" who="S0510">got you yeah yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0509" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0510">oh so that's Brecht is it?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0509">yeah Brecht</u>
<u n="158" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0509">I want to say that that's total theatre but it's not <pause dur="short"/> can't think what that's called</u>
<u n="160" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm mm anyway i've forgotten how we got here oh yes about your drama teacher saying that you're more suited erm</u>
<u n="161" who="S0509">to heightened naturalism</u>
<u n="162" who="S0510">right okay</u>
<u n="163" who="S0509">which is good <pause dur="short"/> so yeah and er they kind of they've moved a few people from class to class now to kind of get cos there's a couple of different A level classes</u>
<u n="164" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="165" who="S0509">to sort of get better group dynamics or whatever or make sure people who are going to be working in a certain way are all kind of together</u>
<u n="166" who="S0510">oh okay</u>
<u n="167" who="S0509" trans="overlap">so they're doing that a bit even though there's quite like there's quite a few people in our class who don't like doing naturalism</u>
<u n="168" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="169" who="S0509">like there's a few girls who like playing the comedy parts and like the men and that</u>
<u n="170" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="171" who="S0509">er yeah and do all that</u>
<u n="172" who="S0510"><vocal desc="laugh"/> what? so girls that like playing men sort of in the Shakespearian sort of mould</u>
<u n="173" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah cos like <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0510" trans="overlap">Victorian mould as well</u>
<u n="175" who="S0509">just just er in in a more comedy way they like to play characters that are completely removed from themselves</u>
<u n="176" who="S0510">oh okay yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0509" trans="overlap">sort of thing</u>
<u n="178" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="179" who="S0509">erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> used to be like that she'd be like I feel more comfortable playing a man</u>
<u n="180" who="S0510">right <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="181" who="S0509">cos it's just cos it's separate from yourself I guess</u>
<u n="182" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="183" who="S0509">you don't feel</u>
<u n="184" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="185" who="S0509">like you're putting yourself out there too much I don't mind I don't care</u>
<u n="186" who="S0510" trans="overlap">right yeah</u>
<u n="187" who="S0509">oh the other thing was erm there's they're going to have a poetry by heart competition at the college where you have to recite one or two poems</u>
<u n="188" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0509">erm in mid-November from this list I need to look it up and then they choose one winner to go on to perform at like a I don't know whether it's a regional or national competition then</u>
<u n="190" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="191" who="S0509">which is cool so I'm going to do that</u>
<u n="192" who="S0510">oh great</u>
<u n="193" who="S0509" trans="overlap">but I need to get in contact with my teacher but I just thought of that that's another performance thing <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="194" who="S0510">performance thing? sorry I must have missed</u>
<u n="195" who="S0509">reciting poetry</u>
