<u n="1" who="S0588">I've been reliving our previous conversations</u>
<u n="2" who="S0613">that must be very er surreal actually</u>
<u n="3" who="S0588">it's</u>
<u n="4" who="S0613">it's like this sounds familiar</u>
<u n="5" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it's it's interesting to see how I interact and</u>
<u n="6" who="S0613">yes cos you're analysing yourself</u>
<u n="7" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0613" trans="overlap">aren't you? <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0588">but I'm I seem to vary a lot sometimes I sound really confident and other times absolutely a bit of a social disaster</u>
<u n="10" who="S0613">but you erm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0588" trans="overlap">and</u>
<u n="12" who="S0613">you can't put tone of voice in can you? in the recordings can you?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0588" trans="overlap">no no <pause dur="short"/> no that it's just the words but</u>

<u n="18" who="S0613"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="19" who="S0588">but managed to do a few with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> as well when he was here</u>

<u n="22" who="S0613"><vocal desc="laugh"/> loads and loads of material</u>
<u n="23" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="long"/> but they've reached nine million words now er that have been transcribed</u>

<u n="153" who="S0588" trans="overlap">a happy person</u>
<u n="154" who="S0613">of being actively happy it's a case of just not letting the bad things that happen <trunc>sp</trunc>spoil spoil their life</u>
<u n="155" who="S0588" trans="overlap">no she no she doesn't because whereas <pause dur="short"/> she's she doesn't get sensitised she's not sensitised by everything that happens or everything happens and it just sort of brushes off her cos there's always negativity</u>
<u n="156" who="S0613">mm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0588" trans="overlap">around but it doesn't affect her</u>
<u n="158" who="S0613">but also cos there was a kind of acceptance cos she's saying to me we she was talking about how <trunc>sh</trunc> er her <pause dur="short"/> when her cancer first got diagnosed in Greece cos they missed it here</u>
<u n="159" who="S0588">yes</u>

<u n="163" who="S0588" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="164" who="S0613">and she said she was joking with the nurses cos she was saying well I should think er it's working <trunc>m</trunc> the way up my body she said I I've <vocal desc="laugh"/> had cervical cancer I've had ovarian cancer so now it's now it's <trunc>br</trunc> time for breast cancer and she <trunc>s</trunc> they they kind of the nurses couldn't believe that she was making a almost a joke out of it</u>
<u n="165" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0613">but then there was also kind of a sense of well if it's that's what's gonna happen that's what's gonna happen so</u>
<u n="167" who="S0588">and that's what</u>
<u n="168" who="S0613" trans="overlap">and there's no</u>

<u n="175" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0613">mm I suppose although she did take it very well when she told me how they'd completely missed it in the UK and she you know she was about to go on holiday and and the the doctor said oh erm <trunc>o</trunc> there was er the severity of the problem and he said oh don't worry I'll do the test when you get back which was in four months' time</u>
<u n="177" who="S0588">right</u>
<u n="178" who="S0613">and if they hadn't found it in Greece</u>

<u n="180" who="S0613">it could have really</u>
<u n="181" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="182" who="S0613">I mean it was pretty far gone</u>
<u n="183" who="S0588" trans="overlap">that would have been curtains</u>

<u n="185" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0613" trans="overlap">there's some incompetent doctor</u>

<u n="188" who="S0613">and you nearly die</u>
<u n="189" who="S0588" trans="overlap">on on the other hand the anger would is would not do the cancer any good</u>
<u n="190" who="S0613">no</u>

<u n="192" who="S0613">no</u>
<u n="193" who="S0588">even then</u>
<u n="194" who="S0613" trans="overlap">but I suppose</u>
<u n="195" who="S0588" trans="overlap">you need sort of somehow process it in a different way</u>

<u n="274" who="S0613">mm</u>
<u n="275" who="S0588" trans="overlap">and anything outside of that <pause dur="short"/> and it's like the way they don't they don't consider diet really odd they do with maybe diabetes but only just</u>

<u n="741" who="S0588" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="742" who="S0613">let's just have a look at it and we all went back there and we we cleared a lot of stuff actually</u>

<u n="745" who="S0588" trans="overlap"><unclear>it might</unclear> look sad</u>
<u n="746" who="S0613">erm we it had a lot of personal stuff in which</u>
<u n="747" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="748" who="S0613" trans="overlap">I think was putting people off so</u>

<u n="750" who="S0613" trans="overlap">we we got rid of a lot a lot and erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was gonna take a lot of stuff down to the charity shop and so we sorted a lot of stuff out and erm we decided we were gonna get the carpets cleaned cos some of them were a bit</u>
<u n="751" who="S0588">mm</u>
<u n="752" who="S0613" trans="overlap">looking a bit grubby and we weren't sure about the pictures cos they make it look very personal so maybe it's hardly for <trunc>somebo</trunc> to imagine themselves in there</u>
<u n="753" who="S0588" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="754" who="S0613">and we kept couldn't make up our minds whether it was better with or without the pictures but the latest thing we're thinking is take all the pictures down get the walls repaired so they haven't got empty hooks and just</u>
<u n="755" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="756" who="S0613" trans="overlap">give it a coat of paint just to</u>
<u n="757" who="S0588" trans="overlap">that really works wonders</u>
<u n="758" who="S0613" trans="overlap">so it's a bit of a neutral space not take all the furniture out</u>
<u n="759" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah it's</u>
<u n="760" who="S0613" trans="overlap">but just make it</u>
<u n="761" who="S0588" trans="overlap">so off-putting when something's got</u>
<u n="762" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="763" who="S0588">a kind of <trunc>ol</trunc> a personality that's</u>
<u n="764" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="765" who="S0588">a little bit sad as well that's really it's slightly spooky so it's off-putting</u>
<u n="766" who="S0613">yeah yes there was a lot of personal things I mean the and things just being left <trunc>ly</trunc> er <vocal desc="laugh"/> and one of the twins found</u>
<u n="767" who="S0588" trans="overlap">oh god</u>
<u n="768" who="S0613">biscuits mouldering in a biscuit tin you know the I mean there so it's</u>

<u n="771" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="772" who="S0613" trans="overlap">and we went through the wardrobe and erm sorted out the clothes ones that she might want at the care home and ones that definitely</u>
<u n="773" who="S0588" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="774" who="S0613">you know <trunc>f</trunc> kind of had had it erm and old underwear and stuff and it's kind of like no wonder if someone opens and wardrobe and they kind you know it's not</u>
<u n="775" who="S0588" trans="overlap">well it would have a reek of of sort of not a physical smell but it kind of would</u>
<u n="776" who="S0613" trans="overlap">you wouldn't help wondering has the person died who lived here</u>
<u n="777" who="S0588" trans="overlap">well it's a thick atmosphere</u>
<u n="778" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="779" who="S0588" trans="overlap">to walk through and</u>
<u n="780" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="781" who="S0588">yeah and <trunc>n</trunc> it probably just needs clearing and and like you obviously</u>
<u n="782" who="S0613">yeah but erm</u>
<u n="783" who="S0588" trans="overlap">erm but I mean a good whitewash yeah a neutral space just made and some flowers and made presentable and stuff</u>
<u n="784" who="S0613">yeah so so we've asked <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> if she can get a quote for getting the carpets cleaned and and for having the walls painted</u>
<u n="785" who="S0588">mm</u>
<u n="786" who="S0613">but erm it's a bit odd actually cos she offered to do that and I've I've I sort of emailed on behalf of everyone else and then I said oh I'll give you a call cos I thought I'd rather than just by email just give her a call and check that that's okay erm and I can't get through there's been no answer of on their home number so I hope everything's alright</u>
<u n="787" who="S0588">mm when did you call?</u>
<u n="788" who="S0613">er last night and I tried again today I've left messages on her voicemail I don't think I've got her mobile</u>
<u n="789" who="S0588">mm</u>
<u n="790" who="S0613">but erm and I've emailed so I can't really do much more but</u>
<u n="791" who="S0588">yeah that needs to be can't one of us <trunc>wh</trunc>whitewash the walls?</u>
<u n="792" who="S0613" trans="overlap">well I mean <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s <trunc>orig</trunc></u>
<u n="793" who="S0588" trans="overlap">I'm not a great painter but</u>
<u n="794" who="S0613" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s original suggestion was er oh would <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> like to do it? and and you know obviously it was to come out of the</u>
<u n="795" who="S0588" trans="overlap">well I mean <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and me could probably help with that as well</u>
<u n="796" who="S0613">oh god if you could it would be brilliant actually</u>
<u n="797" who="S0588">I'll ask <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and see what he thinks about it I can't speak for him but I will ask</u>
<u n="798" who="S0613" trans="overlap">I mean and if you don't actually want to do it just organise somebody <trunc>t</trunc> cos ideally it needs somebody there to check that it's done properly do you know what I mean</u>
<u n="799" who="S0588" trans="overlap">but we could do it ourselves couldn't we if it's just I mean I don't wanna say anything cos I'm probably crap at er DIY and stuff but if it's just painting</u>
<u n="800" who="S0613" trans="overlap">well it would be the the hooks the picture hooks will need</u>
<u n="801" who="S0588" trans="overlap">just need filling</u>
<u n="802" who="S0613">filling in</u>
<u n="803" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="804" who="S0613" trans="overlap">so the walls are made good</u>
<u n="805" who="S0588" trans="overlap">can do that</u>
<u n="806" who="S0613">and then</u>
<u n="807" who="S0588" trans="overlap">know how to do that</u>
<u n="808" who="S0613">we just thought a a coat of paint cos it'll look a bit you know then walls get a bit grubby when you take the pictures off</u>
<u n="809" who="S0588" trans="overlap">just whitewash paint cheap paint <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="810" who="S0613">and then get get carpet cleaners in to clean all the</u>
<u n="811" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="812" who="S0613">carpets erm</u>
<u n="813" who="S0588">well I I'll have a word with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> cos I don't mind doing my bit makes me feel a bit better if I do my bit so er if it's something practical like that then</u>
<u n="814" who="S0613">cos we were we were trying to work out</u>
<u n="815" who="S0588">we'd have to sleep in there probably</u>
<u n="816" who="S0613">well that's it you see it needs somebody who's got a few days free to go down there and do it all</u>
<u n="817" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah it would have to be organised wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="818" who="S0613">erm and <vocal desc="laugh"/> like</u>
<u n="819" who="S0588" trans="overlap">but if it's gonna help get the thing shifted cos</u>
<u n="820" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="821" who="S0588">it's a terrible thing to be hanging around</u>
<u n="822" who="S0613" trans="overlap">also we we were we were trying to work out how much money she's got left we reckon she's probably got about another year's worth of money left</u>
<u n="823" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="824" who="S0613" trans="overlap">before she's gonna run <trunc>abou</trunc> out of her money</u>
<u n="825" who="S0588">yeah well I don't know what happens when when that happens when she runs out of money</u>
<u n="826" who="S0613" trans="overlap">well evidently once you've used all your money up the council will pay a certain amount towards it but because that that place is so expensive</u>
<u n="827" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="828" who="S0613">what the council will pay will not cover it</u>
<u n="829" who="S0588">no of course not</u>
<u n="830" who="S0613" trans="overlap">so either someone has to make the shortfall up or she has to move to a cheaper place</u>
<u n="831" who="S0588">oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="832" who="S0613" trans="overlap">and a move would just be a er that would kill her</u>
<u n="833" who="S0588" trans="overlap">and also she's used to living like a queen it would absolutely kill her</u>
<u n="834" who="S0613">yeah so er</u>
<u n="835" who="S0588" trans="overlap">no and</u>
<u n="836" who="S0613" trans="overlap">and also she actually is very happy there now you can tell</u>

<u n="842" who="S0588" trans="overlap">no yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="843" who="S0613">apart from when she blew the candles out which anyone would cough if they did that <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="844" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="845" who="S0613">but you know all this kind of oh I've got this awful cough you know she's she just didn't</u>

<u n="875" who="S0588" trans="overlap">beforehand</u>
<u n="876" who="S0613" trans="overlap">what what what we've done is we took all the stuff that we we know is of value and that we wouldn't want to be lost and we put you know that that like coat cupboard?</u>
<u n="877" who="S0588">right</u>
<u n="878" who="S0613">yeah</u>

<u n="883" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="884" who="S0613">erm and then there was a whole load of stuff in the spare bedroom which was for the charity shop which <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said she'd shift</u>
<u n="885" who="S0588">okay</u>
<u n="886" who="S0613">erm and then we've left the the furniture in there at the moment cos we weren't we weren't sure whether it's better to take that out cos we could</u>
<u n="887" who="S0588">no a little bit of furniture</u>
<u n="888" who="S0613" trans="overlap">get rid of the furniture</u>
<u n="889" who="S0588">is good because even if it's not great furniture but actually no but you might be right the right sort of furniture is could be</u>
<u n="890" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah because then we discussed and thought well if we're gonna do the walls cos you know they've got those kind of like reproduction Victorian light fittings on the walls?</u>
<u n="891" who="S0588">I can't remember but anyway</u>
<u n="892" who="S0613" trans="overlap">oh but but they're really kind of like</u>

<u n="894" who="S0613">and I just wondered if er if we changed those for something slightly more contemporary erm</u>

<u n="896" who="S0613" trans="overlap">well exactly they might want it exactly so</u>
<u n="897" who="S0588" trans="overlap">is gonna be old for a start it could just be smartened up and spruced up</u>

<u n="899" who="S0588">couldn't it?</u>
<u n="900" who="S0613">or it could be just that the agents aren't doing a very good job of</u>

<u n="930" who="S0613">no <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="931" who="S0588">but if it's just someone coming over</u>
<u n="932" who="S0613">but but <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> because I mean the money could come out of ma's account so it's just a case of getting some quotes and finding out <trunc>some</trunc>somebody who's gonna do a good do a good job for the price and then <trunc>superv</trunc> you know making sure they're doing what you want them to do and</u>
<u n="933" who="S0588">mm</u>

<u n="939" who="S0588">no</u>
<u n="940" who="S0613" trans="overlap">so it's <vocal desc="laugh"/> <trunc>th</trunc>that's the problem because then you spend a lot of time you've got to travel down there and then you've got to stay down there and then</u>
<u n="941" who="S0588" trans="overlap">well you it probably takes about a week it think probably about a week's worth of</u>
<u n="942" who="S0613">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but erm it's cos</u>
<u n="943" who="S0588" trans="overlap">but that sounds very doable though all that</u>
<u n="944" who="S0613">well it should yeah</u>
<u n="945" who="S0588" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="946" who="S0613">erm in theory</u>
<u n="947" who="S0588">and erm just no clutter and clutter's the off-putting thing just er cos this place just had the odd table yeah the odd bit of furniture</u>
<u n="948" who="S0613">mm</u>
<u n="949" who="S0588" trans="overlap">and it was all whitewashed and it looked really good</u>
<u n="950" who="S0613">yeah</u>
<u n="951" who="S0588">but it was nothing special but it did look really good</u>
<u n="952" who="S0613" trans="overlap">but you can imagine what</u>
<u n="953" who="S0588" trans="overlap">cos it was neutralised</u>
<u n="954" who="S0613" trans="overlap">you might be able to do with it yeah</u>
<u n="955" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="956" who="S0613">yeah cos I remember when we went to see that flat and there was no furniture in it and it seemed quite spacious</u>
<u n="957" who="S0588">yeah?</u>
<u n="958" who="S0613" trans="overlap">I remember walking around it</u>
<u n="959" who="S0588" trans="overlap">well maybe</u>
<u n="960" who="S0613">and er</u>
<u n="961" who="S0588">maybe take the furniture out I just think the odd bit of furniture is good er a nice <trunc>ob</trunc> who's your customer? you have to think er about who the customer is</u>
<u n="962" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah I mean it's going <trunc>definit</trunc> obviously going to be retired</u>
<u n="963" who="S0588" trans="overlap">you can't do like <vocal desc="laugh"/> modernist <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="968" who="S0613" trans="overlap">oh we we can do it <vocal desc="laugh"/> we could go and live there <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="969" who="S0588"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I was thinking you could do a you could do a really <trunc>wro</trunc> get it really wrong <vocal desc="laugh"/> and do a sort of modern <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="970" who="S0613">yeah</u>
<u n="971" who="S0588">kind of</u>
<u n="972" who="S0613">well when they first moved in I kind of thought particularly cos where they've got the dining table and it all the crumbs were dropping on the carpet and everything</u>
<u n="973" who="S0588">mm</u>
<u n="974" who="S0613" trans="overlap">and I thought it would be really nice to put a parquet floor down</u>
<u n="975" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="976" who="S0613" trans="overlap">that but evidently you're not allowed to though cos of the noise it has to be</u>
<u n="977" who="S0588" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="978" who="S0613" trans="overlap">carpet but erm which is a shame but you could as erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you can put that erm what's it called sisal carpet? it's it's like a coconut matting kind of</u>
<u n="979" who="S0588">okay is that</u>
<u n="980" who="S0613" trans="overlap">so if your</u>
<u n="981" who="S0588" trans="overlap">like erm <pause dur="short"/> what's that called? it's like a almost like er something you'd wipe your feet on</u>
<u n="982" who="S0613">yes</u>
<u n="983" who="S0588">but there's it's nice I really like those</u>
<u n="984" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah it's <trunc>g</trunc> it's <trunc>g</trunc> yeah you you've got a sort of pattern it's like ridged</u>
<u n="985" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="986" who="S0613">but it's very neutral colours it's the <trunc>be</trunc> next best thing if you can't have floorboards</u>
<u n="987" who="S0588" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="988" who="S0613">it's kid of the next best thing</u>
<u n="989" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="990" who="S0613">cos then you could put rugs on top if you want but it's so</u>
<u n="991" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it's probably not it's just a matter of</u>
<u n="992" who="S0613" trans="overlap">but then that's us perhaps an old</u>
<u n="993" who="S0588" trans="overlap">neutralising thing</u>
<u n="994" who="S0613" trans="overlap">older person</u>
<u n="995" who="S0588">and some it would show off the paintings nicely or the pictures nicely if they had we could maybe change a few pictures and choose something</u>
<u n="996" who="S0613">yeah well I mean we were we we rethinking yeah just take all rather than have have any pictures up just take them all down</u>
<u n="997" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="998" who="S0613">and just have</u>
<u n="999" who="S0588" trans="overlap">mirrors are good</u>

<u n="1001" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0613" trans="overlap">and</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0588">I remember this place had a lot of mirrors in it er</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0613">so someone was quite skilful then <trunc>wi</trunc> <trunc>d</trunc> erm marketing this place</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0588">yeah definitely cos there was nothing to get offended by and in fact we could just move I straight away and not be offended really</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0613">right</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0588">there was nothing that needed changing</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0613">mm</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0588" trans="overlap">so we could still be</u>

<u n="1012" who="S0613"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="1017" who="S0588" trans="overlap">be livable in so <trunc>tha</trunc> I think that's the key if you <trunc>thi</trunc> if you think there's loads to change</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0613">mm</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0588">then <pause dur="short"/> yeah er leave that with me and I'll see it would be</u>

<u n="1021" who="S0588">I'd have to approach it like <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I'll have to talk to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> about it <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> and see if it's cos I I need a man there to do it with I couldn't</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0613">well you just need someone that to it's quite hard to yeah</u>

<u n="1042" who="S0589">I wonder could ditch the furniture</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0588">but I <trunc>th</trunc> I think cos there's holes in the wall where the paintings were and stuff like that so</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0613">I mean it might be your your your time's better spent supervising somebody else to do it</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0588">mm yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0613">because getting people around to do the quotes that could all be done from here</u>

<u n="1057" who="S0588" trans="overlap"><trunc>w</trunc>would you be okay doing that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>? just there to supervise things cos we could go round <anon type="place"/> as well while we're there</u>

<u n="1060" who="S0613" trans="overlap">cos that's that's that's that's one of the things that need doing you see which <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I think is offering to do but I don't know</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0588" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0613">but but someone needs to er get people in to give quotes</u>
