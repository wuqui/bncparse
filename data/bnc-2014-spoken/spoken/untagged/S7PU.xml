<u n="38" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="39" who="S0505">and I had a big sort of plant collection press them and I'd take them into the <unclear/> and identify them and erm when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I used to go out on his fieldwork cos he'd go along the streams looking for snails and taking samples of that and I'd help him a bit but then I'd walk on my own down the street and people would stop and talk to me quite a friendly way but then the erm Africans er the driver for instance and one of the lab assistants you know said oh madam don't don't go walking on your own now it's not safe</u>
<u n="40" who="S0428">mm so it changed it used to be safe</u>
<u n="41" who="S0505" trans="overlap">it changed and changed yes and when there was at the other side of one of the game parks was a hill that we called <trunc>th</trunc> it was the black hill it was an old volcano one of the latest volcanos to go off and it was still more or less ash and the plants were just beginning to climb up</u>
<u n="42" who="S0428" trans="overlap">oh wow</u>
<u n="43" who="S0505">and and there was sort of semi circular tracks up it and you could climb right to the top and one way you looked to Kilimanjaro it was lovely</u>
<u n="44" who="S0428" trans="overlap">oh wow</u>
<u n="45" who="S0505">and the other way you looked right across Kenya to mount <anon type="place"/> it was actually super I'm I always used to go up</u>

<u n="52" who="S0428">mm mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0505">so we went out of the game entrance and then we went and we said we were going to climb this and they said oh you must take a guard with you</u>
<u n="54" who="S0428">really?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0505" trans="overlap">and they gave us with a an African who didn't really want to come with an A K fourteen slung over his arm you know? to guard us</u>
<u n="56" who="S0428">cos it was that dangerous?</u>
<u n="57" who="S0505" trans="overlap">and er well they said that it was that dangerous because er</u>
<u n="58" who="S0428">I guess it's also like if something happened it would be on the news and they don't want any bad press</u>
<u n="59" who="S0505" trans="overlap">yeah no they didn't want that cos they were trying to build up the tourist trade as well</u>
<u n="60" who="S0428">and I guess now that's been totally</u>
<u n="61" who="S0505" trans="overlap">and it it was fairly dangerous cos it was one part where Somalia came almost down right down like that</u>
<u n="62" who="S0428">oh that's always been dangerous Somalia</u>
<u n="63" who="S0505" trans="overlap">and you could look eh where they've always been raiders and thieves really <pause dur="short"/> they're always raiding for cattle and goodness knows what</u>
<u n="64" who="S0428" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="65" who="S0505">and they were of course poaching the animals in the game parks it was done largely by the Somalis and so we had to have this chap and so he said you're not going to climb up to the top are you? you know? <vocal desc="laugh"/> he was only a sort of young boy so he said oh dear dear and he came up puffing up the hill</u>
<u n="66" who="S0428">ah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0505">up after us he didn't want to come at all but he managed to get there and er we gave him a drink of water and</u>
