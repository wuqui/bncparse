<u n="223" who="S0251">Toulouse</u>
<u n="224" who="S0369">Toulouse in France <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I should imagine I don't know but we'd have made the Rolls-Royce engines</u>
<u n="225" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="226" who="S0251">quite likely</u>
<u n="227" who="S0252">not all of them are Rolls-Royce some of them are General Electric</u>
<u n="228" who="S0369">some have?</u>
<u n="229" who="S0252">are General Electric</u>
<u n="230" who="S0369">oh are they?</u>

<u n="234" who="S0368">but what we that particular one? was that a Rolls-Royce?</u>
<u n="235" who="S0252">I would say for the Airbus Air three twenty the General Electric tends to be more popular</u>
<u n="236" who="S0369">mm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="237" who="S0252">because it has a lower fuel consumption than the Rolls-Royce</u>
<u n="238" who="S0368">oh right</u>
<u n="239" who="S0252">the Rolls-Royce tend to do best on the long range aircraft</u>
<u n="240" who="S0369">mm</u>

<u n="250" who="S0369">well it's funny you mention that because there has been <pause dur="short"/> er an enquiry going on and that of <pause dur="short"/> a pilot who passed out</u>
<u n="251" who="S0252">mm yes</u>
<u n="252" who="S0369">with the air being recirculated <pause dur="short"/> er and and it's sort of recirculated er through the engines</u>

<u n="254" who="S0369">well <pause dur="short"/> er along those lines say <pause dur="short"/> enough for him to pass out and the copilot had to take over</u>

<u n="263" who="S0369" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> but er <pause dur="short"/> in a way there's not enough er <pause dur="short"/> what I heard this morning on the news and on the telly was the er not enough places for a helicopter to land the rescuers and investigators who has gone down so far had gone down on ropes <pause dur="short"/> cos there's nowhere for the helicopter to land properly</u>
<u n="264" who="S0251" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> so they won't be able to take any equipment really or <pause dur="short"/> cutting equipment and?</u>

<u n="324" who="S0368" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="325" who="S0252">requires some very sort of clever organisation really you've got to make sure the margins are as wide as they can be so you can get as much material in</u>

<u n="331" who="S0369" trans="overlap">difficult yeah difficult to read</u>

<u n="334" who="S0368" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0252">I think fourteen is generally the recommended</u>

<u n="347" who="S0369" trans="overlap">well it does it's tricks of the trade really</u>
<u n="348" who="S0252">I have to sort of sort out text boxes and that type of thing</u>
<u n="349" who="S0368">mm</u>
<u n="350" who="S0252">and also you don't want it to look as though you have used a text box so you've got to move the</u>

<u n="352" who="S0252">the line</u>
<u n="353" who="S0368">oh yeah</u>
<u n="354" who="S0252">sometimes I do a little erm</u>

<u n="362" who="S0369">you've just got to hit on the <pause dur="short"/> correct formula really</u>

<u n="367" who="S0252">the covering letter would have to be more tailored to what you're applying for</u>
<u n="368" who="S0368" trans="overlap">yes I see</u>
<u n="369" who="S0252">so it's a bit hard to do that in advance</u>

<u n="377" who="S0252">you've a better chance if you get it in the couple of first few days it's open rather than the day before it closes</u>
