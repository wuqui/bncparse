<u n="1" who="S0208">quite a few years ago</u>
<u n="2" who="S0202">we can talk normal</u>
<u n="3" who="S0208">I know yeah quite a few years ago erm there was a girl called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who lived here</u>
<u n="4" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="5" who="S0208">not here obviously erm she lived in I can't remember the name of her village and erm she was <anon type="place"/> her whole family came out and moved here</u>
<u n="6" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0208">and erm on Christmas Eve it's really sad but her dad passed away</u>
<u n="8" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="9" who="S0208">heart attack died</u>
<u n="10" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0208">erm her and her mum found him in an armchair like dead Christmas Eve</u>
<u n="12" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0208">like really awful bless her erm but <trunc>the</trunc>they were renting that house</u>
<u n="14" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="15" who="S0208">and the house they rented my mum used to do the cleaning for</u>
<u n="16" who="S0202">right okay</u>
<u n="17" who="S0208">the blanket that they wrapped him up in my mum took to clean and it was in the erm laundry room outside</u>
<u n="18" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0208">for quite a while now I didn't I didn't know I didn't care whatever but that laundry room is exactly underneath my blue room</u>
<u n="20" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0208">my blue room is where I think all the stuff is coming from it's where I hear the stuff it's where the footsteps stop all of that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="22" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0208">so it might just be coincidence it might be my mind putting meaning to something that there doesn't need to be meaning to or anything</u>
<u n="24" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0208">basically all the stuff like me being scared of the room and all that it started as soon as my mum had that blanket like before I even knew about it</u>
<u n="26" who="S0202">really?</u>
<u n="27" who="S0208">yeah it's like it really really freaked me out because it was like someone did die in that</u>
<u n="28" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0208">and got wrapped up in it so I don't know it's weird it might be coincidence but it really freaked me out and me and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> cos this is when he was living here</u>
<u n="30" who="S0202">yeah where did he stay when he moved here?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0208">in the the little blue room that you stayed in the beginning</u>
<u n="32" who="S0202">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0208">he slept in there erm like we did a test like I told him about it and he is the same like he doesn't really believe like he would never ever pay attention when I would tell him and I'd be scared and stuff and try and get reassurances and he just didn't really care at all</u>
<u n="34" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0208">he'd tell me I was stupid so he was like right we'll go do a test <unclear/> we got a plain piece of paper and like a lid from like a <trunc>s</trunc> a spray sort of thing like an aerosol</u>
<u n="36" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0208">it's like a little circle lid put it on the paper drew a circle around it then we'd know if something happened if it was to be moved or anything we'd see that it would moved from around the circle we forgot about it and a few days later we went back and we we couldn't find the lid and there was the paper with the circle <unclear/> around it but I couldn't for the life of me find the lid and I haven't found it since it's just literally just disappeared and I've always thought that it was him playing a trick trying to scare me</u>
<u n="38" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="39" who="S0208">but when I really got it out of him of him I was like was that you? you have to tell me I was getting really really scared and he swears that it wasn't him</u>
<u n="40" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0208">but I don't know might have been him trying to freak me out</u>
<u n="42" who="S0202">I don't think he'd do that to you</u>
<u n="43" who="S0208">but still</u>
<u n="44" who="S0202">personally I don't think</u>
<u n="45" who="S0208"><unclear/> cos anything bad that I've heard or felt or anything has it come from that room</u>
<u n="46" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0208">it's like when me and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> heard the footsteps and he heard them as well you could hear them in that room and they would stop like you could judge where distance is they would just stop in that doorway never in my bedroom just that room</u>
<u n="48" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0208">I just don't like it</u>
<u n="50" who="S0202">maybe someone's died in there before</u>
<u n="51" who="S0208">well I don't know because this was a family home and like the amount of generations that people have lived and died here but I don't</u>
<u n="52" who="S0202" trans="overlap">cos <trunc>wh</trunc> didn't didn't you convert it when you moved here weren't it just a shell? like there were nothing in it?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0208">mm mm there was loads of stuff in it it my dad just demolished walls and put them up in different places</u>
<u n="54" who="S0202">right okay</u>
<u n="55" who="S0208">so it didn't look anything like it does now</u>
<u n="56" who="S0202">right</u>
<u n="57" who="S0208">but erm just <unclear/> but my mum when I've talked to her about this stuff she said that she chose this place on purpose because there were no spirits here like she didn't feel anything so she chose it on purpose cos she wanted a neutral place cos her house in <anon type="place"/> apparently was very haunted</u>
<u n="58" who="S0202">right</u>
<u n="59" who="S0208">and she said that <unclear/> she used to feel it all the time and apparently like I don't I remember one instance but I don't remember at all any of the stories that she used to tell me</u>
<u n="60" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0208">when I'd apparently like talk to people like see people or feel them and stuff</u>
<u n="62" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0208">but she said that there used to be people there all the time like she'd feel them and I don't remember exactly having spoken to her about it like since but there was something apparently that like a white lady used to live in <anon type="place"/> at our place it used to be her place</u>
<u n="64" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0208">called her the white lady because she always used to be dressed in white and stuff</u>
<u n="66" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0208">like she wasn't evil</u>
<u n="68" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="69" who="S0208">it wasn't anything nasty my mum would just sense her sometimes and she used to do spiritual <trunc>trai</trunc> like healing healer training ritual something</u>
<u n="70" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0208">like all about spirits and like healing and all that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="72" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0208">as the name implies</u>
<u n="74" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="75" who="S0208">and erm I had a friend in the village can't remember her name I know it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s mum my sister's friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and erm she used to do it <unclear/> I remember one day they were in the living room talking and I came in and my mum's friend just randomly asked they must have been talking about it and she just said go over to that corner over there in the room do you feel anything? so I did and whatever and I was like yeah it's a bit cold it's a bit weird she's like yeah but do but do you feel anything? and apparently I told her I was like yeah there's someone standing next to me cos like apparently she could sense it and she wanted to see if I could or something like weird</u>
<u n="76" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0208">but it's happened before where I've seen something like not particularly someone but something</u>
<u n="78" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0208">in my bedroom when I was really young but I used to have these really really horrible nightmares about it wasn't a person it was like black smoke in chains</u>
<u n="80" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0208">and it would always come into my bedroom and I'd hear the chains outside my bedroom and all that kind of stuff and I never brought up my mum cos I was always too scared</u>
<u n="82" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0208">but I just used to put it down to being like bad dreams but there's been some points like in my bedroom <trunc>whe</trunc>when I still lived in England like you said I wasn't sure if it was a dream or real</u>
<u n="84" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0208">it just used to freak me out</u>
<u n="86" who="S0202">I can remember once when we were kids I'd say more teenagers about like <trunc>fou</trunc> thirteen fourteen this field we'd always used to go to meeting lads on a Sunday we'd erm we'd meet up in the morning at ten o'clock we'd all play football like play football till twelve and then everyone would go home and have their dinner at home like Sunday dinner and all that and erm we'd come back after and then we'd like get pissed so <trunc>wou</trunc> everyone would bring some wine or whatever they could nick from their parents just the fact that whatever they could someone to buy them and erm this once <unclear/> we weren't getting pissed we <unclear/> we were drinking but we weren't really getting pissed like and we were sat at the top of the field and so we were facing this way and on your right-hand side is a school like a primary school that I used to go to everyone in the village went to and then on your left is erm a separate field with a fence so you're in this field there's trees at the top and then there's a fence and then there's a golf course behind you in the <trunc>for</trunc> in a wood</u>
<u n="87" who="S0208">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0202">and then there's a fence and a pub and just like some empty ground sort of a field and erm at the bottom of the field there's an old fence that you have to jump over to get on to this field cos it's meant to be the primary school's field like they own it and erm we were just sat at the top of the field and we were all just sat chilling out I sat with my boyfriend and everyone else was just sat with whoever and we were all just sat chatting and we saw these white light like it was shaped like a human like a not a woman or a man just like a human it was not like really big like five foot nine or something like that in height and it sped from one side of the field to the other and it <trunc>tu</trunc> and behind the pub on the left were a big mansion and it opened up onto the golf course and the wood as well and it turned out that this old woman who there was a story like this old woman that had died erm she's died and then her son came back off holiday a few days later and erm he was he'd had a chat to her like how you blah blah blah and then <unclear/> brother found out she <trunc>wo</trunc> she'd died a few days later he was like oh I was only talking to her the other day and they're like hang on she died while you were on holiday like while you were abroad she died when you weren't here it's like well that's impossible cos I were talking to her like two days ago it's like no she died when you weren't here this is the first time I've been able to get to see you cos of whatever and like turns out that he was talking to a ghost that's the story anyway don't know how true it is</u>
<u n="89" who="S0208" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0202">but we saw that three or four times in the whole time that we went there like we saw this this thing just shoot from one field to the next like a shooting star just like there's one second gone the next like so fast like it weren't a human it weren't a torch cos if it were a torch <unclear/> car like</u>
<u n="91" who="S0208">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0202">spinning round the corner and that's why it went so fast but there were no road</u>
<u n="93" who="S0208" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's weird</u>
<u n="94" who="S0202">like and we were all freaked out we all legged it like to the bottom of the field and like fucking freaked out <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="95" who="S0208">that's really weird</u>
<u n="96" who="S0202">but yeah that thing with my mum all eh her and her friends did a Ouija board and erm they all like left the game so like they all got freaked out and just stopped playing they didn't like ask permission to leave from the spirits or anything like that and whether it's a coincidence or not a few days later one of her friends a black girl erm that she were friends with erm died she were crossing the road and a car were coming one way</u>
<u n="97" who="S0208" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0202">and a car going that way and she got hit by both like she got sandwiched between them both and got chucked up in the air and she were dead like instantly and then a few days after or a few weeks another girl died <pause dur="short"/> I don't know how she died though can't remember I think she <trunc>k</trunc>killed herself or someone murdered her like it was pretty bad</u>
<u n="99" who="S0208">it's awful</u>
<u n="100" who="S0202">but my mum I can remember being saying I'm going to a sleepover is it okay? blah blah blah and she was just like oh what are you going to do? like I told her she freaked the fuck out like my mum doesn't freak out about anything smoking drugs sex anything <trunc>if</trunc>if I told her that I were doing something she'd be like right okay and she'd give me some advice about it she would never freak out she would never go fucking mental even if I told her I were high off my tits on heroin like she probably would go mad but she wouldn't freak out like she did and she went fucking mental like proper freaked out she was like you don't ever fucking do that if you ever do that you're never coming back into my house and all this <unclear/> and she were like if I ever find out you've done that I will kick you out and I will never speak to you again and all this stuff and <unclear/> woah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0208" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="long"/> erm do you remember <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0202"><unclear/> happen like <pause dur="short"/> proper freaky it's like I can feel <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>s grandad all the time not all the time but like at odd instances I can feel him and I've told you a million times</u>
<u n="103" who="S0208">yeah but that thing that I just told you about the black cloud I knew it was a woman but the black cloud and the chains</u>
<u n="104" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0208">I literally I don't think I've even thought about that since it's happened</u>
<u n="106" who="S0202">that would freak me the fuck out</u>
<u n="107" who="S0208" trans="overlap">it's just a thought that's just come to me I've never brought it up with my mum like I've literally I feel like I've not you know when something happens and sometimes you replay memories</u>
<u n="108" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0208">and think about it I don't genuinely think I've ever thought about that since I was a child until now</u>
<u n="110" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0208">like it's just sort of hit me so it just reminds me that tomorrow I'll talk to my dad or I'll erm talk to my mum about it and just see if it fits anything she ever felt or</u>
<u n="112" who="S0202" trans="overlap">but maybe that <pause dur="short"/> but maybe that <trunc>we</trunc> that weird dream because of like maybe you felt something as in like <pause dur="short"/> you you wanted to be free but you didn't feel free stuff like that you know just like smoky chains</u>
<u n="113" who="S0208" trans="overlap">maybe it just it it just feels like something that's too graphic and too grown up like too metaphorical for someone of that age</u>
<u n="114" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0208">cos when I lived in that house in <anon type="place"/> I mean I moved here when I'd just turned ten</u>
<u n="116" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0208">like that just seems like something that I wouldn't really be aware about</u>
