<u n="156" who="S0041">porridge <pause dur="short"/> porridge</u>
<u n="157" who="S0084">yeah it's good <pause dur="short"/> I need to get that early <pause dur="short"/> um one of the questions was is Iran a great threat? And uh half the people were saying yes and half the people were saying no obviously <pause dur="short"/> um and he was saying what they need to do right is like go over into all the countries and like round up all the bad people and just shoot them and I was like right you see</u>
<u n="158" who="S0041">uh</u>
<u n="159" who="S0084">the thing is</u>
<u n="160" who="S0041">pretty strong</u>
<u n="161" who="S0084">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was like</u>
<u n="162" who="S0041">I mean I'm well I'm actually agreeing with him however</u>
<u n="163" who="S0084" trans="overlap">you are going to join the navy so essentially that is going to be a part of your re thought <pause dur="short"/> um but the <trunc>thin</trunc> over day we have intelligence agencies <pause dur="short"/> we have the CIA <pause dur="short"/> we have The Secret Service that is sort of their job</u>
<u n="164" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0084">um</u>
<u n="166" who="S0041">they shouldn't get to the point where they're bad people in actual fact</u>
<u n="167" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="168" who="S0041">if they were doing their job properly <pause dur="short"/> they shouldn't</u>

<u n="170" who="S0041">need to be shot because they should never be able to get to where they are</u>
<u n="171" who="S0084">yeah but basically that's their <trunc>ide</trunc> that's their job is to like round up as much information about these people as possible to stop any actions being taken against the country you know or externally <pause dur="short"/> that's their job <pause dur="short"/> he said yeah but they need to like go out of the country like kill them but then they can't kill them I said well I can't sign off on that cos I'm a pacifist I don't believe in the that no matter how bad a person is I don't they don't deserve to be killed for it <pause dur="short"/> he's like you know like if I was going to kill if I was going to walk down on the street with a gun and like killing kill ten people what would you do? And I was like fucking run away <vocal desc="laugh"/> you maniac <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="172" who="S0041">fucking cut you right out</u>

He said what if  what if  you had a gun what would you do? I was like I'm not fucking Rambo I'm not what going to tackle you to the ground bloody hell <pause dur="short"/> and I was like I'll call the police and he was like there's no police <pause dur="short"/> I was like right so we're living in some sort of guerrilla state where there's no police or authority? He said yeah what are you gonna do? I said oh well I'll probably still run away I mean even if I had a gun because if we're talking about me as I am now I couldn't do it but I did qualify the statement with the uh if I did do with the idea that I did it I've never had anyone close to me hurt <pause dur="short"/> I've never</u>
<u n="174" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0084">you know I mean my sister hasn't been</u>

<u n="181" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I don't</u>

<u n="186" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="187" who="S0084">you can't make that call really <pause dur="short"/> I mean ideologically I would say I don't agree with anybody being killed it's not our right to take away someone's life no matter how heinous the crime but I've never experienced something that bad</u>
<u n="188" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="189" who="S0084">so um maybe I would think differently <pause dur="short"/> oh smells delicious <unclear/></u>

<u n="305" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="306" who="S0041">but if they really wanted us to have a healthy work life balance given that we'll come in on stupid days for events or or stay longer or and nobody else does that <pause dur="short"/> cos they just</u>

<u n="439" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="440" who="S0041">I think it was probably a bit of half and half</u>
<u n="441" who="S0084">hmm <pause dur="short"/> hmm <pause dur="short"/> by the way it was a really really sweet thing to do</u>
<u n="442" who="S0041">hmm</u>

<u n="460" who="S0041">Jesus</u>
<u n="461" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="462" who="S0041">so maybe he has got teeth and they're just fucked but I couldn't see back far enough to see if they have got holes <pause dur="short"/> I mean I couldn't say anything cos I've got a hole cos I didn't have any adult teeth</u>
<u n="463" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="464" who="S0041">and my teeth didn't fall out till I was my baby teeth didn't fall out until I was nineteen</u>
<u n="465" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="466" who="S0041">hmm <pause dur="short"/> I've got a massive gap right just there</u>
<u n="467" who="S0084">hmm?</u>
<u n="468" who="S0041">you see?</u>
<u n="469" who="S0084">you'd never notice</u>
<u n="470" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's not as big as a tooth like you couldn't get a tooth in it</u>
<u n="471" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="472" who="S0041">Cos as I've grown it's kinda pushed together a bit <pause dur="short"/> look</u>
<u n="473" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="474" who="S0041">had there was it was a big enough for a tooth in it when it started</u>
<u n="475" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="476" who="S0041">but I have one one tooth two less</u>
<u n="477" who="S0084">hmm</u>

<u n="479" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="480" who="S0041">I don't know why</u>
<u n="481" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="482" who="S0041">so I can't really you know prey on poor old toothless <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> but uh he I don't even how can you uh</u>
<u n="483" who="S0084">doesn't he?</u>
<u n="484" who="S0041">hmm  I've noticed that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s teeth are quite bad</u>
<u n="485" who="S0084">are they?</u>
<u n="486" who="S0041">hmm <pause dur="short"/> like quite black <pause dur="short"/> not not black as in all of them black but I'm sure like behind</u>

<u n="488" who="S0041">that bit</u>
<u n="489" who="S0084">that's fillings isn't it? Like if you don't have a white <trunc>fi</trunc> like it's more expensive to have a white filling</u>
<u n="490" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="491" who="S0084">Cos it's for cosmetic reasons <pause dur="short"/> so usually if you've just got a mercury filling like the one they did for mine at the back which actually is starting to be a bit painful sometimes when I <unclear/> back hmm if you can't see it they just do a mercury filling which is cheaper</u>
<u n="492" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="493" who="S0084"><trunc>S</trunc> so if he'd had a hole on the front of his teeth like for example</u>
<u n="494" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="495" who="S0084">they would have done a white cap on it <pause dur="short"/> they would have fixed it</u>
<u n="496" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="497" who="S0084">with a white filling but because it's the back he would have made that decision where you can't really see or just have a mercury filling probably</u>
<u n="498" who="S0041">ooh</u>
<u n="499" who="S0084">but the thing is you can obviously notice</u>
<u n="500" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know I just pay for mine white</u>
<u n="501" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="502" who="S0041">but plus I've got quite a few fillings <pause dur="short"/> I think I've got about seven</u>
<u n="503" who="S0084">I think you've just got to make the call about where it is like even if it was at the back of my front teeth I would have white</u>
<u n="504" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="505" who="S0084">because you</u>
<u n="506" who="S0041">at the front teeth</u>
<u n="507" who="S0084">know yeah</u>
<u n="508" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="509" who="S0084">but like this one was the second from the back and so I just thought</u>
<u n="510" who="S0041">oh God</u>
<u n="511" who="S0084">no it's everybody like a dentist that's it <pause dur="short"/> even if you do like a little  tennis</u>
<u n="512" who="S0041">uh hmm</u>
<u n="513" who="S0084">it's not if they were looking down there</u>
<u n="514" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well before I went abroad  before I went abroad  cos I didn't think I was going to come back <pause dur="short"/> I went to the dentist and said just look at if there's anything that needs doing do it now</u>
<u n="515" who="S0084">uh hmm</u>
<u n="516" who="S0041">um cos I didn't know when the the next time I would go to a dentist would be</u>
<u n="517" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="518" who="S0041">uh and he gave me seven fillings in one go</u>
<u n="519" who="S0084">shit</u>
<u n="520" who="S0041">yeah and at the time I thought that's like that's extreme he said no it's nothing they're just little ones <pause dur="short"/> but still</u>
<u n="521" who="S0084">I don't know if you can actually do that <pause dur="short"/> can you legally?</u>
<u n="522" who="S0041" trans="overlap">I don't know  I don't know  um</u>
<u n="523" who="S0084">wow</u>
<u n="524" who="S0041">but since the other dentist I went to after that was like holy fuck why have you got all these fillings?</u>
<u n="525" who="S0084">really?</u>
<u n="526" who="S0041">yeah and <trunc>par</trunc> most of them I didn't need</u>

<u n="530" who="S0041">yeah and they were like five at the time</u>
<u n="531" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="532" who="S0041">I didn't pay for it but</u>
<u n="533" who="S0084">such <unclear/> isn't it? I mean we had um like those pre emptive fillings when we were kids <pause dur="short"/> we had um in the back two teeth and the bottom back two teeth and the top we had white fillers but not fillings but they're fillers to stop you getting cavities in the back and now</u>
<u n="534" who="S0041">wow</u>
<u n="535" who="S0084">they're white and they did it to all of our teeth <pause dur="short"/> so it was me and my brother and my sister and then my sister she was a little bit older</u>
<u n="536" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="537" who="S0084">I was probably about seven or eight and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would have been five</u>
<u n="538" who="S0041">I didn't even have my adult teeth by then <pause dur="short"/> no adult teeth</u>
<u n="539" who="S0084">really?</u>
<u n="540" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> I didn't start getting adult teeth till I was about I probably started getting them at about seven or eight</u>
<u n="541" who="S0084">I think I'm remembering it wrong then cos that sounds young doesn't it?</u>
<u n="542" who="S0041">hmm <pause dur="short"/> maybe</u>
<u n="543" who="S0084">maybe it was when I was at secondary school but I just remember feeling very young</u>
<u n="544" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="545" who="S0084">isn't it? I can't remember I thought it was when I was in primary school</u>
<u n="546" who="S0041">Cos I remember in year six mum was gonna pay for me to have all my teeth painted like coated</u>
<u n="547" who="S0084">oh yeah</u>
<u n="548" who="S0041">which might be the same type of thing</u>
<u n="549" who="S0084">hmm <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="550" who="S0041">all of them and he said we can't do it until you've got your adult teeth <pause dur="short"/> so I know I didn't have them by then</u>
<u n="551" who="S0084">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah maybe I was a bit older? hmm <pause dur="short"/> I can't even remember <pause dur="short"/> it was  it was  it seemed like a good idea I suppose to my parents because</u>
<u n="552" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="553" who="S0084">sort of pre empting I think</u>
<u n="554" who="S0041">protecting</u>
<u n="555" who="S0084">yeah they had you know they didn't have you know a good dental care when they were kids and I suppose they got <trunc>h</trunc> had a lot of work later in life which must have been painful and expensive so</u>
<u n="556" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0084">I guess they were really into us like brush your teeth you know twice a day um look after your teeth cos once they're gone it's you're fucked</u>
<u n="558" who="S0041">hmm <pause dur="short"/> that was awesome</u>
<u n="559" who="S0084">yeah</u>

<u n="565" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> good</u>
<u n="566" who="S0041">hmm hmm</u>
<u n="567" who="S0084">they probably sat in the uh oven for a while longer</u>
<u n="568" who="S0041">ah <pause dur="short"/> I really need to</u>
<u n="569" who="S0084"><unclear/></u>

<u n="571" who="S0084">Good for you</u>
<u n="572" who="S0041">I was going to say I really need to learn how to cook them</u>
<u n="573" who="S0084">it's dangerous</u>
<u n="574" who="S0041">then I thought no I don't <pause dur="short"/> I'll just live on them</u>
<u n="575" who="S0084">when I'm at my mum's <trunc>s</trunc> she's got a <unclear/> garden so I'll go and pick rosemary and then put rosemary and thyme and put rosemary  put rosemary  and thyme and garlic</u>
<u n="576" who="S0041">hmm</u>

<u n="580" who="S0041">awesome <pause dur="short"/> that wasn't too bad for you was it?</u>
<u n="581" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> I think Dan's regime is going to be high protein if that's what it's going to be about <pause dur="short"/> which is fine</u>
<u n="582" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="583" who="S0084">like he tried to make me a protein shake earlier and I was like I don't really like drinking <unclear/></u>
<u n="584" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="585" who="S0084">just bare that in mind when you're creating this diet plan for me and he said no we'll sit down and you can tell me your favourite food and I was like it consists of any sandwiches <vocal desc="laugh"/> If you can make me a diet out of fish fingers and sandwiches</u>
<u n="586" who="S0041">fish fingers and sandwiches</u>
<u n="587" who="S0084" trans="overlap">that would be fab I'm not feeling very confident</u>
<u n="588" who="S0041">hmm <pause dur="short"/> I think I'm going to start my protein shakes again <pause dur="short"/> I've still got loads of them <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="589" who="S0084">I suppose and they are really good to have before the gym aren't they? Cos they do give you that energy boost and then you just</u>
<u n="590" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="591" who="S0084">you just hammer it</u>

<u n="600" who="S0041">yeah I know I do <pause dur="short"/> I do it until I'm going to be sick but I think that's probably cos my threshold isn't very good like I'll run until I'm gonna I feel like I'm gonna vomit and then</u>
<u n="601" who="S0084"><unclear/></u>
<u n="602" who="S0041">when I go on the weights like the one that you push this way</u>

<u n="614" who="S0041">but if you have a look</u>
<u n="615" who="S0084" trans="overlap">like bench presses</u>

<u n="629" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="630" who="S0041">jaws of life <pause dur="short"/> you know he wouldn't ordinarily go out with him</u>

<u n="636" who="S0041">he's not I thought he was I thought  I thought  he was really really thick <pause dur="short"/> he's not that thick <pause dur="short"/> um he definitely definitely says things that are a little bit say in front of a boy but he doesn't say it in front of me</u>
<u n="637" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="638" who="S0041">which is never never wonderful <pause dur="short"/> but</u>

<u n="640" who="S0041" trans="overlap">he used to be in the cadets</u>
<u n="641" who="S0084">right</u>

<u n="649" who="S0084">uh hmm</u>
<u n="650" who="S0041">in the army or in the RAF but he's not bright enough to get in as an officer</u>

<u n="653" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="654" who="S0041">um he was saying there's this thing right? Cos obviously he he's quite built I don't know how cos he looks so  and I thought <vocal desc="laugh"/> but um the thing on the gym have you got this with the <trunc>par</trunc> like the wires that come off and the handles and you get it and you're supposed to do this or something or?</u>
<u n="655" who="S0084">oh yeah you can add we've got loads of attachments yeah</u>
<u n="656" who="S0041">yeah what is? So I just thought well I'm not going anywhere near that <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what the hell it does</u>
<u n="657" who="S0084">hmm</u>

<u n="659" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="660" who="S0041">but apparently if you do that it's supposed to work every single core muscle</u>

<u n="673" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="674" who="S0041">and I think he said that apparently <pause dur="short"/> they were told when he was training for the marines to do that cos it uses all your core muscles <pause dur="short"/> so you've got to keep yourself stood up</u>
<u n="675" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="676" who="S0041">keep yourself in the same position and then move the muscles that the thing is supposed to work</u>

<u n="698" who="S0041">I don't think it's as bad as the cardio <pause dur="short"/> it just makes your head spin a bit <pause dur="short"/> makes my head spin</u>
<u n="699" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="700" who="S0041">a bit sometimes <pause dur="short"/> but you sat down so</u>
<u n="701" who="S0084">I think I don't push myself the same way I do with the cardio <pause dur="short"/> if I'm running and I get you know I get umm out of breath or whatever I push myself a bit more than I would if I do weights hmm I'd feel a pain in my arms</u>
<u n="702" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="703" who="S0084">I'd stop that</u>
<u n="704" who="S0041">I only push myself till I'm set when I've when I first start on a thing <pause dur="short"/> I'll pick it up and see how much I can comfortably do this with</u>
<u n="705" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="706" who="S0041">or whatever it is</u>
<u n="707" who="S0084">hmm</u>

<u n="712" who="S0041">it should be really hard</u>
<u n="713" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="714" who="S0041">and that means by the time I'm in the third lap by the time I get to five I think I can't do anymore</u>
<u n="715" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="716" who="S0041">so it's not  it's not  too much of a push but I think that it's different with the weights isn't it? Cos you can't push yourself <trunc>fa</trunc> so far your arms just can't do it <pause dur="short"/> they're just</u>
<u n="717" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly yeah</u>
<u n="718" who="S0041" trans="overlap">your body physically can't make it <pause dur="short"/> whereas on cardio I think no matter how hard I push myself if you're if there's a gun to my head I could push a bit more</u>

<u n="720" who="S0041">do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="721" who="S0084">yeah</u>

<u n="723" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="724" who="S0041">whereas if you can't push with your arm you can't just</u>

<u n="735" who="S0084">yeah</u>

<u n="742" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="743" who="S0084">besides you'd be stuck in traffic jam <pause dur="short"/> you know you could just</u>
<u n="744" who="S0041">no I just go down to the bottom of the street turn left turn right and park</u>
<u n="745" who="S0084">oh I see <pause dur="short"/> well you might  you might  as well just walk back <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean? You might as well walk down to the river and run up and down and then walk back</u>
<u n="746" who="S0041">walk back</u>
<u n="747" who="S0084">Cos that's <trunc>y</trunc> your warming up and your cooling down</u>
<u n="748" who="S0041">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="749" who="S0084">and then</u>
<u n="750" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's true</u>
<u n="751" who="S0084">and then you'd be able to tell how much more you can run with each one you do if you run a bigger distance</u>
<u n="752" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="753" who="S0084">um if you're planning to do</u>

<u n="784" who="S0041">because on a Sunday we used to I don't know where I got it from <pause dur="short"/> I don't know who I saw do it but I've done it here you know put a pot pile of salt and dip the whole potatoes in the salt</u>
<u n="785" who="S0084">yeah it's pretty nice <pause dur="short"/> it's a good tip actually <pause dur="short"/> if you're doing the potatoes in the microwave cos you do you can't actually spend two hours <unclear/> the potatoes you can cook them in the microwave or have the oven on til it gets hot so you can cook for ten minutes wrap them in um <trunc>pape</trunc> in a paper towel with olive oil and then um add salt and it crisps it up and you just wrap it in the oven for five minutes and then just makes it a little bit harder rather than having a soft skin <pause dur="short"/> it's a good tip</u>
<u n="786" who="S0041">so you'd cut it up like this?</u>
<u n="787" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no you just cook the jacket potato as normal in the microwave however long it takes to cook in the inside then when it's cooked wrap it in um kitchen towel</u>
<u n="788" who="S0041">still whole?</u>
<u n="789" who="S0084" trans="overlap">still whole and then sprinkle <trunc>ol</trunc> um salt and olive oil over it and then wrap it in the oven for five or ten minutes <pause dur="short"/> it just crisps it up</u>
<u n="790" who="S0041">with the paper towel under it?</u>
<u n="791" who="S0084">hmm well that's just to keep the olive oil from running everywhere</u>
<u n="792" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="793" who="S0084">Good tip</u>
<u n="794" who="S0041">rub it on</u>

<u n="810" who="S0041">so it seems strange that they're the things that you'd be like oh</u>

<u n="824" who="S0041">so I just maybe scoop just the middle chunk of potato out and then my <unclear/> can go in there</u>
<u n="825" who="S0084">oh okay</u>
<u n="826" who="S0041">so I still leave like maybe a centimetre of potato around the edge</u>
<u n="827" who="S0084">hmm</u>

<u n="839" who="S0084">uh hmm</u>
<u n="840" who="S0041">and they'd clear the lot</u>
<u n="841" who="S0084">I know it is good <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's expensive it's three fifty</u>
<u n="842" who="S0041">hmm</u>

<u n="844" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="845" who="S0084">but it was nice <pause dur="short"/> when I worked at <anon type="place"/> it could get a cold cos I worked there from October to March and uh in the winter it was cold at the shop and we'd have to keep the door open cos the <unclear/> was a fucking bitch <pause dur="short"/> cos obviously she's paying for heating and she's the one that it's it's she doesn't care about it escaping she just wants the customers to come in <pause dur="short"/> um so even though <trunc>whe</trunc> I mean when it snowed she relented finally um <vocal desc="cough"/> she made us put a sign on the door that says you know come in we're still open we're just keeping warm <pause dur="short"/> um which <trunc>s</trunc> she copied from Ted Baker cos that's what they did <pause dur="short"/> they put the same sign on the door <pause dur="short"/> um <vocal desc="cough"/> yeah so I used to go and get it and I think I discovered the chicken curry and cheese thing when I went um when I ordered tuna and cheese and they were like tuna oh well loads of the students get chicken curry and cheese <pause dur="short"/> so the cheese goes in first and I like cheese <pause dur="short"/> the cheese goes in so the butter goes in the cheese goes in so cheese melts and the potatoes really hot and then the chicken curry goes on the top <pause dur="short"/> so you've got a nice chicken like nondescript sort of chicken curry which is quite mild but with a bit of a kick to it</u>
<u n="846" who="S0041">yeah a bit like the curry sauce you get from the chips shop <unclear/> yeah</u>

<u n="1223" who="S0084">the Big Question?</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0041">the Big Question which is a killer really</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it is</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0041">Cos you like that don't you?</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0041">you like that bit of a niceness</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0084">it's pretty low I mean it's quite nice there was no sort of uh well pff it's nine AM probably time for you to get your knickers on</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0041">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1231" who="S0084">and get out <pause dur="short"/> um there was none of it not until like the afternoon he said I've got to go do this thing with the <unclear/> boys yeah I've got a  I've got a  do a few things <pause dur="short"/> I was supposed to go to see my friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> today and have dinner and <unclear/></u>
<u n="1232" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0084">but she's got a stinking cold so</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0041">nice</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0084">so in my head it's more like right well I've got to leave by lunch time probably and then she text me and said oh no I've I'm too poorly so then I was like well I haven't really got any plans because but you know I've got to get out so right two o'clock afterwards we stayed out of the rain together</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0041">yes</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0084">and the day before I was like okay it's a bit weird now maybe we should not be doing the couple thing <pause dur="short"/> um just got my stuff and left <pause dur="short"/> but it is I mean <trunc>i</trunc> it's really hard cos even though in your head you're like no you don't want a boyfriend and you sort of fall into that rhythm naturally <pause dur="short"/> I mean I <trunc>lit</trunc> unless you literally do the hotel shag and leave again</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1239" who="S0084">the more time you spend with someone the more you get to know them the more you care for them like</u>
<u n="1240" who="S0041">yeah even just in a conversation with someone</u>
<u n="1241" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1242" who="S0041">even if you just spend more time in a conversation with someone you automatically</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0041">without wanting to <pause dur="short"/> you know more about them</u>
<u n="1245" who="S0084">it's quite an attachment</u>
<u n="1246" who="S0041">and you see which bits who touched who</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0084">uh hmm</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's so hard</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0084">it is hard and I think cos even the first time I met him when I was noticing that he was quite skinny and he was saying things that alarmed me <pause dur="short"/> he was saying when he started to train obviously he bulks up and then then he can eat whatever he likes but hmm mostly um he was quite careful with what he eats and he was saying like he lost a bit of weight on his tummy and it was just generally all over cos he's sort of cut back on the food and he really liked how he looked <pause dur="short"/> so he just kept not eating properly and just really cut another food and really enjoyed getting skinner and skinner and I was like you know this is what people with eating disorders say</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0084">you know <trunc>t</trunc> they like the fact that they're disappearing before their very eyes and it motivates them to not eat any food because that's</u>
<u n="1252" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1253" who="S0084">what spurs them on and he said yeah I know  I know  it does sound a bit wrong and yeah I am trying you know and I think he really took it to heart which I didn't realise at the time like you say these things and you just think people don't hear your comments</u>
<u n="1254" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1255" who="S0084">and it's more because you don't him describing it that way worried me cos I thought it sounds like you might be verging on having a problem and he said well I do know because I'm aware that I'm aware of it you know because it's not like I don't see it <pause dur="short"/> um so yeah when you do start to care for people and</u>
<u n="1256" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1257" who="S0084">he was talking about his kids and he was like you know I can't have them here and would it be nice to sort of meet and whatever <pause dur="short"/> cos obviously I'm not ready to meet his kids thank God</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> winner</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0084">um so yeah I do it feels good to know him <pause dur="short"/> I mean we have a really nice time together <pause dur="short"/> but that's all I want to keep it as <pause dur="short"/> but at the same time you're like a part of you does want to be the booty call and part of you doesn't <pause dur="short"/> it's hard isn't it? You know you think well why don't you want to ask me on a date? And then when he does you're like <unclear/> we're not doing that we're not doing the date thing <pause dur="short"/> so I think you know I sort of feel for him <pause dur="short"/> he just can't really win</u>
<u n="1260" who="S0041">hmm <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="1261" who="S0084">but we'll see</u>
<u n="1262" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean uh I suppose you won't the more time you spend with him</u>
<u n="1263" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1264" who="S0041">then the more secure you'll be in your decision as to whether you want to pursue this as a date situation</u>
<u n="1265" who="S0084">possibly it could be</u>
<u n="1266" who="S0041">or whether you want to keep it as a friends with benefits situation</u>
<u n="1267" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1268" who="S0041">but right now I don't think there's any any disadvantage to keeping him at arm's length on it</u>
<u n="1269" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> absolutely</u>
<u n="1270" who="S0041">until you're sure before you take the <trunc>l</trunc> the leap</u>
<u n="1271" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1272" who="S0041">do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="1273" who="S0084">I mean because really this is what always happens like when I was with <unclear/> for a few months and it wasn't just similar to this you know although we never had the initial conversation that I'm not looking for love it was more let's got a few dates and let's time together and when then I started to realised it wasn't quite what I wanted <pause dur="short"/> whereas in this instance</u>
<u n="1274" who="S0041">should I get my fleece</u>
<u n="1275" who="S0084" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="1276" who="S0041">I'm freezing <pause dur="short"/> sorry dear go on <pause dur="short"/> whereas in this instance?</u>
<u n="1277" who="S0084">um yeah from the off we both said no we're not looking for anything and so he does really nice things <trunc>c</trunc> he ask me round to dinner he cooks me dinner and I when the night he's not going to kick me out in the morning and you know we we watch movies together <pause dur="short"/> we have nice chats <trunc>w</trunc> none of which I'm reading anything into</u>
<u n="1278" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1279" who="S0084">but you inevitably you are spending a lot of time with one person that</u>
<u n="1280" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1281" who="S0084">or you know you just  you just  don't wanna I don't wanna really sit in a position where I let myself start thinking oh maybe he is interested and then I tell him and be like <unclear/></u>
<u n="1282" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1283" who="S0084">a girlfriend?</u>
<u n="1284" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1285" who="S0084">so um I guess it's just a case of taking it at face value <pause dur="short"/> trying not to be the crazy one</u>
<u n="1286" who="S0041">yup</u>
<u n="1287" who="S0084">it's always a bit of a challenge</u>
<u n="1288" who="S0041">which do you know what I think? In each relationship there's always one crazy one</u>
<u n="1289" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1290" who="S0041">do you know what I think? There's always one crazy one</u>
<u n="1291" who="S0084">yeah and invariably it's me <pause dur="short"/> um I think</u>
<u n="1292" who="S0041">well no it's <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="1293" who="S0084">I mean I have met a few crazy blokes in my time let's be honest Doctor Phil</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0041">I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had been more crazy than you from what you said</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0084">yeah <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> that was pretty crazy <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0041">I think he probably had more craziness in him</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1298" who="S0041">and I think the crazy person shifts as well</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0041">like initially with with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I was the crazy one</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1302" who="S0041">Cos I was like really like him</u>
<u n="1303" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0041">which in hindsight was very intense and actually really unlike me but maybe that is because I'd just finished things with <anon type="name" nameType="n"/></u>
<u n="1305" who="S0084">possibly but then he was giving you the signs for you to do that</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0084">like you would have never had done that had he not encouraged it</u>
<u n="1308" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> and then he was the crazy one</u>
<u n="1309" who="S0084">he was saying all the stuff that you know I want you to be my girlfriend <pause dur="short"/> I want you to commit to me and blah blah blah</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0084">and then he went mental</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Actual mental</u>
<u n="1313" who="S0084">and then you realised that he was the mental one all along</u>
<u n="1314" who="S0041">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's the killer and the mental ones  but um</u>
<u n="1315" who="S0084">and you just get on with him so well</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0041">hmm <pause dur="short"/> okay so this message I wrote just said</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0041">say hi hope you had fun the other night um I know lads will be lads but please don't mention details to anyone</u>

<u n="1573" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1574" who="S0041">Cos I can't really gauge what he's going to be like now <pause dur="short"/> but um</u>

<u n="1586" who="S0041">and it's still going to be a irregular</u>
<u n="1587" who="S0084">exactly <pause dur="short"/> it's just a lot of effort <pause dur="short"/> you might be working weekends you know and I think that's what puts him off <pause dur="short"/> like the <unclear/> the money is so good but it means work and he doesn't want to work weekends</u>
<u n="1588" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1589" who="S0084">unless it's an emergency but any kind of job where you're self employed <pause dur="short"/> it's not going to be stable is it?</u>

<u n="1617" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1618" who="S0041">and lived in each other's pockets <pause dur="short"/> it was very intense <pause dur="short"/> it was very full on and we both knew exactly what we were doing you know I met his family then they came up and I cooked them like apple pie something really English and</u>
<u n="1619" who="S0084">uh hmm</u>
<u n="1620" who="S0041">you know he would always invite me to go down and stay <pause dur="short"/> we both knew that as intense as it was it was temporary</u>

<u n="1622" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1623" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1624" who="S0041">we both signed up for that <pause dur="short"/> but before him nah I didn't keep on anyone <pause dur="short"/> it was very much a not a hotel room <trunc>situ</trunc></u>
<u n="1625" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1626" who="S0041">but cos he was <trunc>friend</trunc> with people that I was friends with</u>
<u n="1627" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1628" who="S0041">that I mean <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <trunc>w</trunc> we did that the whole kind of friends with benefits thing on and off since we were sixteen</u>
<u n="1629" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1630" who="S0041">till being twenty-two</u>
<u n="1631" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1632" who="S0041">which is quite a long time for a friends with benefits situation</u>
<u n="1633" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so <trunc>f</trunc> for not for both of you not to have entered into a relationship at that time</u>
<u n="1634" who="S0041">well he did but he was cheap</u>
<u n="1635" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="1636" who="S0041">and I never slept with him while he was with her but they were on and off a bit like this Jeremy Kyle thing <pause dur="short"/> she was a child and I don't know what the hell he was doing with him cos he's not he's lovely</u>
<u n="1637" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1638" who="S0041">full of himself</u>
<u n="1639" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="1640" who="S0041">but in the way that I knew  I knew  him and it wasn't actually true</u>
<u n="1641" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="1642" who="S0041">and if he tried to pull it I'd just knock him down a pick or two</u>
<u n="1643" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1644" who="S0041">cos we've known each other since we were about thirteen <pause dur="short"/> he was actually my first boyfriend that my mum met</u>
<u n="1645" who="S0084">aaw that's quite cute</u>
<u n="1646" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> obviously she didn't know that he wasn't my real boyfriend but we didn't care</u>
<u n="1647" who="S0084">not a problem</u>
<u n="1648" who="S0041">not a problem at all <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> uh <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah so now after <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> obviously now he's gone a bit crazy but</u>
<u n="1649" who="S0084">crazy knob</u>
<u n="1650" who="S0041">hmm <pause dur="short"/> I did I just really thought that most people</u>
<u n="1651" who="S0084">uh huh</u>
<u n="1652" who="S0041">most boys the majority were pretty standard as the boys that I've known that I've grown up with cos all my friends have always been boys</u>
<u n="1653" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1654" who="S0041">apart from a small group of girls like literally now <pause dur="short"/> apart from you and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> my friends of girls consist of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> literally my entire life seven girls</u>
<u n="1655" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1656" who="S0041">um so I'd I kinda just thought that lads are much easier to read than girls <pause dur="short"/> they were very much there's less of a deviation in craziness</u>
<u n="1657" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1658" who="S0041">with boys and in girls you get this Jeze gonna have a baby</u>
<u n="1659" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1660" who="S0041">craziness</u>
<u n="1661" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> love you hate you</u>
<u n="1662" who="S0041">to kind of <trunc>alt</trunc> normalness</u>
<u n="1663" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1664" who="S0041">and uh that's quite a massive difference but with boys I always kinda thought it was a a smaller</u>
<u n="1665" who="S0084">A smaller variation</u>
<u n="1666" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1667" who="S0084">uh hmm</u>
<u n="1668" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> no <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1669" who="S0084">see I don't know if it's them getting older or what it is but I think you know as soon as someone been <trunc>h</trunc> had their heart broken I think girls you sort of get over it <trunc>a</trunc> you know but keep it with you always cos it shapes who you are</u>
<u n="1670" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1671" who="S0084">I think you</u>
<u n="1672" who="S0041">come more to a logical plane</u>
<u n="1673" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah and I think <trunc>y</trunc> inevitably even if you have been really hurt you do go out there looking for it again not to get hurt but</u>
<u n="1674" who="S0041">uh hmm</u>
<u n="1675" who="S0084">the possibility of finding somebody and then blokes see it as carte blanche well I can shag whoever I like now because I'm single and I can do it if I like</u>
<u n="1676" who="S0041">uh hmm</u>
<u n="1677" who="S0084">I think that's an element of not really giving a fuck and I think that's the problem</u>
<u n="1678" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1679" who="S0084">and then they  then they  can say whatever they like</u>
<u n="1680" who="S0041">and do whatever they want</u>
<u n="1681" who="S0084">and so for a moment they will be like yeah of course I really like you then they'll be you know distant again so</u>
<u n="1682" who="S0041">uh hmm</u>
<u n="1683" who="S0084">I think I've just had such a long run starting with the Norwegian in Cuba after a very quick breaking up with Will <pause dur="short"/> so I came back from Cuba so that was <trunc>Ju</trunc> May two thousand and eight <pause dur="short"/> this is four years ago and so I've broken up with Will in February <pause dur="short"/> I've gone travelling for three months come back I'm sort of seeing this Norwegian guy all quite casual <pause dur="short"/> he came up to Cambridge like five times <pause dur="short"/> I went to Norway and then when I came back he disappeared off the face of the planet <pause dur="short"/> so that was a start of the where men are crazy</u>
<u n="1684" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1685" who="S0084">he was the one who was referring to me as a girlfriend when I was I went up to Norway to break up with him and then realised actually I quite liked him <pause dur="short"/> which is really when he disappeared</u>
<u n="1686" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1687" who="S0084">umm</u>
<u n="1688" who="S0041">choice timing</u>
<u n="1689" who="S0084">yes that's when I realised that karma was a bitch like <vocal desc="laugh"/> what the hell? I went off to uni and then met blokes along the way and sort of fell fell for this guy who was married and all that ridiculous behaviour <pause dur="short"/> I mean that was quite intense and then <trunc>m</trunc> back again just sort of odds of sods and nothing really of note <pause dur="short"/> my friend <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he was the one who shattered your navy dreams temporarily</u>
<u n="1690" who="S0041">yep but I saw right since then</u>
<u n="1691" who="S0084">exactly</u>
<u n="1692" who="S0041">I've done a lot of digging round of talk and he was actually wrong <pause dur="short"/> so I'm quite</u>
<u n="1693" who="S0084">he is</u>
<u n="1694" who="S0041">in fact</u>
<u n="1695" who="S0084">you've got to remember <trunc>h</trunc> he you know he hasn't been in the army for twenty years and he just talks a lot of bollocks <pause dur="short"/> you've just gotta shout him down <pause dur="short"/> so he and I had a bit of a thing for a while off and on but nothing there's never really been anything of note but all of these blokes who came into my life and I realise that men are just mental like they just don't know</u>
<u n="1696" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1697" who="S0084">how to</u>
<u n="1698" who="S0041">have you read <trunc>m</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus?</u>
<u n="1699" who="S0084" trans="overlap">no I just thought it was a bit cheesy</u>
<u n="1700" who="S0041">read it <pause dur="short"/> in fact I might have a copy of it</u>
<u n="1701" who="S0084">is it really cheesy?</u>
<u n="1702" who="S0041">it's quite cheesy but it's really really truthful</u>
<u n="1703" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="1704" who="S0041">like it's not written as a I thought it would be quite written like a fictional novel would be</u>
<u n="1705" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="1706" who="S0041">it's not at all it more written like a handbook</u>
<u n="1707" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1708" who="S0041">um</u>
<u n="1709" who="S0084">well it's a self help book isn't it essentially?</u>
<u n="1710" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1711" who="S0084">that's how they market it <pause dur="short"/> like a bit pops like which is what puts me off really <pause dur="short"/> the idea that women cos it's the sort of at book aimed at women</u>
<u n="1712" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1713" who="S0084">you can't get away from that</u>
<u n="1714" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1715" who="S0084">though I doubt that many men will read it</u>
<u n="1716" who="S0041">I made Jordan read it</u>
<u n="1717" who="S0084">through choice</u>
<u n="1718" who="S0041">I made him read it cos we were just getting on each other's wicks so much at one point</u>
<u n="1719" who="S0084">hmm <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="1720" who="S0041">I was like do you know what? Fuck this <trunc>re</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> we should read this</u>
<u n="1721" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1722" who="S0041">if this is what we actually want to do</u>
<u n="1723" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1724" who="S0041">and it helped on a lot <pause dur="short"/> it helped a lot</u>
<u n="1725" who="S0084">well that's good <pause dur="short"/> but I don't imagine there are many men who would sit on a bookcase and think do you know what I should probably read it that it's a bit illuminating</u>
<u n="1726" who="S0041">hmm <pause dur="short"/> even Jordan didn't get on board enough</u>
<u n="1727" who="S0084">no I don't think that they are I think that's probably what annoys me is that these books talk about women things like He's Just Not That Into You <pause dur="short"/> that film came from a book <pause dur="short"/> there's a self help book <pause dur="short"/> it's a pop psych</u>
<u n="1728" who="S0041">oh did it?</u>
<u n="1729" who="S0084">book <pause dur="short"/> it's that sort of idea understanding men</u>
<u n="1730" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1731" who="S0084">um and knowing how to read them and I think it's you probably useful in a it's probably interesting to work out how to read what other people think generally</u>
<u n="1732" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1733" who="S0084">but this idea that it's targeted women who want to find a husband</u>
<u n="1734" who="S0041">oh no <pause dur="short"/> this this is more like it gave your ideas like if you if you're thinking if you say this that is what he's hearing from it</u>
<u n="1735" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="1736" who="S0041">so it was quite nice cos I was quite shocked by some of it like <trunc>i</trunc> it says like men are like elastic bands basically they'll stretch and stretch and stretch and you'll think you'll never see them again and then bam they're there</u>
<u n="1737" who="S0084">oh really?</u>
<u n="1738" who="S0041">all the time <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1739" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="1740" who="S0041">and also like if women have a problem it's annoying the way it's written cos it like on Venus women are like this and you think cut the crap</u>
<u n="1741" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1742" who="S0041">you know <pause dur="short"/> what it's saying though is little things like if you  if you  have a shit day and you come home and you run it by your partner you're like do you know what? This happened and this happened and I don't really understand why the fuck why she said this or he said that or blah blah blah and really women come home and say it to get feedback you know the other person's opinion on it</u>
<u n="1743" who="S0084">hmm <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="1744" who="S0041">and to kind of reinforce that yeah that was crazy and but you were right though and do you want a drink and you know and that's it <pause dur="short"/> that's all they want <pause dur="short"/> they want the discussion about the topic</u>
<u n="1745" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1746" who="S0041">whereas if you go home you say that to your other half he's going to give you solutions well you should have done this</u>
<u n="1747" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1748" who="S0041">and I used to get so angry with Jordan</u>
<u n="1749" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1750" who="S0041">well why don't you do this? Well no cos that wouldn't work because this <pause dur="short"/> did you not hear</u>
<u n="1751" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1752" who="S0041">that she was emotionally this this this <pause dur="short"/> well okay we'll do this <pause dur="short"/> he <trunc>think</trunc> he thinks he's doing the best thing in the world for me</u>
<u n="1753" who="S0084">hmm <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="1754" who="S0041">Cos I'm Mars <pause dur="short"/> if you're presented with a problem it doesn't matter how that problem's delivered you're you think that what's required is a solution bam</u>
<u n="1755" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1756" who="S0041">done <pause dur="short"/> here you go <pause dur="short"/> that's what you want this don't ya?</u>
<u n="1757" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1758" who="S0041">whereas that's not what the woman wanted at all</u>
<u n="1759" who="S0084">yeah just emotional support</u>
<u n="1760" who="S0041">from that conversation</u>
<u n="1761" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1762" who="S0041">yeah and it says that they're like if if a guy has a problem it's not that he won't talk about it because he doesn't want to but a man's brain in order to find the solution won't bounce ideas <pause dur="short"/> they don't want to do that</u>
<u n="1763" who="S0084">hmm?</u>
<u n="1764" who="S0041">their brain is programmed not to bounce ideas and they their their brain is basically made to self consult</u>
<u n="1765" who="S0084">oh okay</u>
<u n="1766" who="S0041">so the guy will be really quiet and go into his cave</u>
<u n="1767" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="1768" who="S0041">which is what they say <pause dur="short"/> will go into his cave</u>
<u n="1769" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1770" who="S0041">and will do you want me move to this table a little bit?</u>
<u n="1771" who="S0084">that's alright I'm just gonna lean against the radiator a little bit <pause dur="short"/> just so that I don't get too cold <pause dur="short"/> are you warm enough in here?</u>
<u n="1772" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1773" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="1774" who="S0041">um yeah basically they self consult until they can find the solution <pause dur="short"/> cos again</u>
<u n="1775" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1776" who="S0041">faced with a problem they <trunc>h</trunc> they want the solution really kind of hands on</u>
<u n="1777" who="S0084">it's quite logical isn't it?</u>
<u n="1778" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1779" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1780" who="S0041">but if you try and talk to her him</u>
<u n="1781" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1782" who="S0041">while he's in that that process then he will want you to fuck off</u>

<u n="1787" who="S0084">oh really?</u>
<u n="1788" who="S0041">because the fact that he the fact that you would ask that implants that</u>
<u n="1789" who="S0084">you don't</u>
<u n="1790" who="S0041">you think he requires help</u>
<u n="1791" who="S0084">he's incapable of it <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="1795" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1796" who="S0041">Cos he's a man that's what he should be able to do</u>
<u n="1797" who="S0084">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1798" who="S0041">so basically he'll just  himself up until he gets to that solution</u>
<u n="1799" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="1800" who="S0041">which is</u>
<u n="1801" who="S0084">but what did you say I mean like men put it this on a bookcase for example like if you tried to offer any help <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said</u>
<u n="1802" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1803" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>

<u n="1807" who="S0084">I know where I'm going <pause dur="short"/> we <trunc>don</trunc> you clearly don't because this is the third time we've seen that post box <pause dur="short"/> but fine okay</u>
<u n="1808" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1809" who="S0084">we'll just go round again shall we?</u>
<u n="1810" who="S0041">like extreme version of it and uh</u>
<u n="1811" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1812" who="S0041"><anon type="name" nameType="n"/> I realised actually a lot of things we were coming to blows to because a lot of the things that we were struggling with were because of the things that were going on with my family</u>
<u n="1813" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1814" who="S0041">was we were just reading each other really differently and then it gives you like a list of you say he hears he says you hear idea</u>
<u n="1815" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1816" who="S0041">um and a lot  a lot  of our arguments were resolved because instead of thinking that's not what I meant</u>
<u n="1817" who="S0084">uh hmm</u>
<u n="1818" who="S0041">we started more along the lines of thinking that's not how I intended you to receive it</u>
<u n="1819" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1820" who="S0041">so it was more about it doesn't matter whether you meant it or not or whether you meant it to come across like that <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't matter the way somebody receives that information</u>
<u n="1821" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1822" who="S0041">is more valid</u>
<u n="1823" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1824" who="S0041">than how you intended to say it</u>
<u n="1825" who="S0084">absolutely</u>
<u n="1826" who="S0041">and so</u>
<u n="1827" who="S0084">but that's quite an interesting point isn't it? It's like when <trunc>bl</trunc> blokes get annoyed with you for being over sensitive about receiving a comment you know like with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> today for example but it's happened to me before in the past people be like when blokes have said to me you know <trunc>y</trunc> that's not what I meant or something you're just reading it wrong</u>
<u n="1828" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1829" who="S0084">or you're being over sensitive and you think well but that's how I feel like why can't you understand</u>
<u n="1830" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1831" who="S0084">that that's how I feel? Like you saying those words makes me feel this big</u>
<u n="1832" who="S0041">there's a whole part there there's a whole chapter in the book</u>
<u n="1833" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1834" who="S0041">about don't invalidate her feelings</u>
<u n="1835" who="S0084">ah</u>
<u n="1836" who="S0041">Cos men men do this they've had this exact conversation</u>
<u n="1837" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1838" who="S0041">except when we hear them say and I didn't mean it like that or don't be daft you know</u>
<u n="1839" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1840" who="S0041">I'm thinking I'm not stupid</u>
<u n="1841" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1842" who="S0041">because they don't realise that actually what they're making you feel is that you're because you're feeling that way it's not a valid</u>
<u n="1843" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1844" who="S0041">it's not valid and it makes you feel like this this big</u>
<u n="1845" who="S0084">yeah and you're in the wrong</u>
<u n="1846" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1847" who="S0084">and that's not okay</u>
<u n="1848" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> but it's really it was really helpful like</u>
<u n="1849" who="S0084">well that's interesting</u>
<u n="1850" who="S0041">I think everybody should be made to read it</u>
<u n="1851" who="S0084">that is really interesting cos I completely dismissed it out of hand</u>
<u n="1852" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1853" who="S0084">always <pause dur="short"/> always have but I mean that's cos I'm quite a book snob when it comes to things like that <pause dur="short"/> I mean I would never read any pop psych but that's not to say that I don't think that it helps people</u>
<u n="1854" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1855" who="S0084">I just I never thought that it could help me <pause dur="short"/> but <trunc>may</trunc> maybe it does</u>
<u n="1856" who="S0041">and it has even got</u>
<u n="1857" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah so I'll do that</u>
<u n="1858" who="S0041">not a relationship wise because they've described <trunc>me</trunc> on the page on the same chapter that men are like elastic bands women are like waves so every woman in a relationship or not the way their emotions are run</u>
<u n="1859" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1860" who="S0041">is is like a sea</u>
<u n="1861" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1862" who="S0041">so they'll be a calm and instead of a lull before the storm which is not quite accurate this guy was saying and I think that you'll have kind of a really good period in your life</u>
<u n="1863" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1864" who="S0041">and then that kind of peak drops so it kind of gets a bit better and then you know you're really have a great time you're feeling really good very confident and then something will some trigger and obviously everybody's triggers are different will happen and it won't even just be oh that's a bit bad <pause dur="short"/> you'll just</u>
<u n="1865" who="S0084">you'll just plummet</u>
<u n="1866" who="S0041">smash like a wave crashing and once you crash like that you have to kind of learn to get your head round the fact you <trunc>w</trunc> that you won't peak again until you've evened out a bit and then it will gradually build up again</u>
<u n="1867" who="S0084">oh God</u>
<u n="1868" who="S0041">which is really it isn't a really strange thing to think of?</u>
<u n="1869" who="S0084">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="1870" who="S0041">but it's also nice and in the comfort that those days when you're like holy crap</u>
<u n="1871" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1872" who="S0041">you know the world's ending</u>
<u n="1873" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1874" who="S0041">and you smash to the bottom and what you do is you automatically sort friends and opinions and talk through things</u>
<u n="1875" who="S0084">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1876" who="S0041">that it was quite comforting especially with what I was going through at the time to know actually everybody does that</u>
<u n="1877" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1878" who="S0041"><trunc>T</trunc> that is the way women work</u>
<u n="1879" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1880" who="S0041">and I think you also compare it to being at the bottom of a  of a  well</u>
<u n="1881" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1882" who="S0041">if you're  if you're  in the well <pause dur="short"/> just learn to accept the fact that you're in it</u>
<u n="1883" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1884" who="S0041">it's not  it's not  it's inevitable that the wave's going to come back up again</u>
<u n="1885" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1886" who="S0041">but women <trunc>don</trunc> just seem to go there and forget that whereas men would never crash and burn</u>
<u n="1887" who="S0084">uh hmm</u>
<u n="1888" who="S0041">they're always quite <unclear/> toe whether they're interactive or not is the thing that changes</u>
<u n="1889" who="S0084">hmm <pause dur="short"/> that's interesting isn't it?</u>
<u n="1890" who="S0041" trans="overlap">whereas a woman will always be very interactive</u>
<u n="1891" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1892" who="S0041">but whether she's on a real positive or a real negative is quite severe</u>
<u n="1893" who="S0084">wow</u>
<u n="1894" who="S0041">how weird is that?</u>
<u n="1895" who="S0084">yeah I mean it doesn't <unclear/> come to think well it's reciprocal you know it's it's gonna happen and if you're going to keep going and so no matter how bad it feels any time it's going to get better <pause dur="short"/> you have to believe that it's going to get better</u>
<u n="1896" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1897" who="S0084">and so you know you are going to pick yourself up and you are gonna the situation is going to improve itself</u>
<u n="1898" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1899" who="S0084">you know you things are going to get better</u>
<u n="1900" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1901" who="S0084">you know it's quite an encouraging thought</u>
<u n="1902" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1903" who="S0084">that other women and other people have been in a similar situation and</u>
<u n="1904" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1905" who="S0084">it gets better <pause dur="short"/> it gets easier you know whatever it is that you're dealing with</u>
<u n="1906" who="S0041">that's quite</u>
<u n="1907" who="S0084">I guess when you feel quite alone like a lot of the times and sort of reading it</u>
<u n="1908" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1909" who="S0084">from another perspective like being able to understand the person that you're with a lot more</u>
<u n="1910" who="S0041">especially like if you're in a relationship and you know that really there's so much that goes on behind closed doors that you can't run by someone else</u>
<u n="1911" who="S0084">uh hmm</u>
<u n="1912" who="S0041">even if you wanted to</u>
<u n="1913" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well it's very personal isn't it?</u>
<u n="1914" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1915" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1916" who="S0041">which I think was quite a which is where Samarra and I came into the if you ever want to get married then I'm going to come and live with you for three months</u>
<u n="1917" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1918" who="S0041">because she saw everything one first hand <pause dur="short"/> all their arguments <pause dur="short"/> everything</u>
<u n="1919" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1920" who="S0041">which was quite difficult for her at some  at some  point</u>
<u n="1921" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1922" who="S0041">cos obviously she lived with us and you can't like get like distance</u>
<u n="1923" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1924" who="S0041">if we needed distance but Samarra and I are close enough that if that was the case we'd just go</u>
<u n="1925" who="S0084">you just know</u>
<u n="1926" who="S0041">to your room</u>
<u n="1927" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1928" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but and she saw some things that I never told her she said I <trunc>c</trunc> I didn't imagine how child like he was with things and how picky and I was like well there you go</u>
<u n="1929" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1930" who="S0041">I mean she's very much like she's we're like the same person cos I think when you start to mature</u>
<u n="1931" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1932" who="S0041">we we were maturing at the same time in the same surroundings living in each others pockets so inevitably you both kind of get bits of each other <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="1933" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> absolutely</u>
<u n="1934" who="S0041">but yeah <pause dur="short"/> but the thing was I made Jordan read it and he still  he still  carried on repeating this same type of behaviour that was causing arguments</u>
<u n="1935" who="S0084"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1936" who="S0041">and sometimes I'd have to say which makes <trunc>m</trunc> which sounds awful cos you don't want to do this hear this from the person that you love say <pause dur="short"/> did you not read the book? You know the reason why we're arguing is this</u>
<u n="1937" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1938" who="S0041">and he's like oh yeah when it it feels a bit not very comfortable that you'd have to bring that up</u>
<u n="1939" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1940" who="S0041">when you really I'm thinking you've got a brain how did you not get to that yourself?</u>
<u n="1941" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1942" who="S0041">not that this book is like the be all and end all but in some situations they were kind of really stark stark comparisons</u>
<u n="1943" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="1944" who="S0041">and he <trunc>did</trunc> he didn't get it <pause dur="short"/> hmm <pause dur="short"/> it was a bit weird but it's definitely worth a punt <pause dur="short"/> I mean I wouldn't take you know everything it's saying it's all</u>
<u n="1945" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1946" who="S0041">you know everything's gospel</u>
<u n="1947" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1948" who="S0041">but</u>
<u n="1949" who="S0084">maybe I will <pause dur="short"/> it might be quite illuminating</u>
<u n="1950" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="1951" who="S0084"></u>
<u n="1952" who="S0041">I used to read it and would just go to Samarra cos she was living with us at the time <pause dur="short"/> you're never going to believe this <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1953" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="1954" who="S0041">you know if you say this to a boy this happens and this happens you know they're actually thinking this? And Jordan would sit there and go yeah</u>

<u n="2017" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="2018" who="S0041">Jordan did GCSEs college incorporating foundation degree H and D one year and topped it up to a degree</u>
<u n="2019" who="S0084">oh right <pause dur="short"/> why did he do that then?</u>
<u n="2020" who="S0041">so usually if you do ah I don't know? Where did he I I I think the idea the split is if you do something that's more vocational or art based</u>
<u n="2021" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="2022" who="S0041">like illustration or graphic design or health care that instead of doing A Levels people tend to do an MBQ</u>
<u n="2023" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="2024" who="S0041">which is I think MBQ Three is the same pitch as A Level</u>
<u n="2025" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="2026" who="S0041">which although I was a snob and didn't believe it currently apparently that's true <pause dur="short"/> whatever <pause dur="short"/> um and then after that you'd go straight to uni there you would do a <trunc>found</trunc> either a foundation year if they needed to top up</u>
<u n="2027" who="S0084">like an MD and then HND</u>
<u n="2028" who="S0041" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> that's it</u>
<u n="2029" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="2030" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so whereas if you go to uni and you don't finish your third year</u>
<u n="2031" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="2032" who="S0041">you walk away with a diploma</u>
<u n="2033" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="2034" who="S0041">you can actually which I think is like a failure I know it sounds awful but you never  you never  go to uni intending to walk away with a diploma do ya?</u>
<u n="2035" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="2036" who="S0041">you don't</u>
<u n="2037" who="S0084">well no</u>
<u n="2038" who="S0041">but</u>
<u n="2039" who="S0084">like when you do a post graduate degree like if you do all of the modules without the dissertation you can get a diploma so you can get a post graduate diploma but you don't get a master's qualification</u>
<u n="2040" who="S0041">hmm <pause dur="short"/> is that it?</u>
<u n="2041" who="S0084">social yeah</u>
<u n="2042" who="S0041">I never knew what that was</u>
<u n="2043" who="S0084">it's a PG Dip so you get a post graduate diploma which just means that you've done all the course work and all the classes up until like main or whatever</u>
<u n="2044" who="S0041">that's what my friend <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> got but he went for PGC so</u>
<u n="2045" who="S0084">oh <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="2046" who="S0041">he didn't really want a masters</u>
<u n="2047" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> fine</u>
<u n="2048" who="S0041">and he just got it that's fine</u>
<u n="2049" who="S0084">so yeah if you're teaching that's all you need</u>
<u n="2050" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="2051" who="S0084">so you wouldn't you don't spend the extra like six months doing it</u>
<u n="2052" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="2053" who="S0084">unless you've felt like if as a sense of you're doing it for yourself</u>
<u n="2054" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="2055" who="S0084">rather than it's what the need to have a vocation qualification which I think really my masters was a bit of both <pause dur="short"/> I wanted to be able to prove that even though I got a <unclear/> used to be like I got at Desmond at um undergrad I got a two two um because I basically got every grade across the board</u>
<u n="2056" who="S0041">me too</u>
<u n="2057" who="S0084">so I've got my transcripts cos this is when when I applied for my um MA and there's marks in the eighties and there's fails</u>
<u n="2058" who="S0041">me too yeah</u>
<u n="2059" who="S0084">across the board and my tutor Mister <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> would literally be tearing his hair out <pause dur="short"/> he said what it like he said you are obviously competent you can obviously do it <pause dur="short"/> so why aren't you doing it? And I said like well I've</u>
<u n="2060" who="S0041">aren't interested</u>
<u n="2061" who="S0084">like really struggling <vocal desc="laugh"/> having a difficult time emotionally and he said really? No <pause dur="short"/> I just got really pissed <vocal desc="laugh"/> <trunc>s</trunc> sorry about that <pause dur="short"/> he <trunc>l</trunc> I think for them it is frustrating because you're clearly there just to have a good time and learn a bit along the way</u>
<u n="2062" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="2063" who="S0084">and I think that's why I wouldn't go to university <pause dur="short"/> I had to go now</u>
<u n="2064" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="2065" who="S0084">because to come up with fifty grand worth of debt just isn't viable for a degree that it's very nice but means nothing to me</u>
<u n="2066" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="2067" who="S0084">so when I went back I suppose it was a chance for me to prove that I could get a good degree and prove to others even though you don't need to</u>
<u n="2068" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="2069" who="S0084">just thought you should <pause dur="short"/> so it was partly to go back to prove that I can apply myself because I wanted a vocational qualification to publishing to actually get a job a career at the end of it</u>
<u n="2070" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="2071" who="S0084">rather than to get a degree for the sake of it <pause dur="short"/> but also to sort of better yourself and to  and to  learn</u>
<u n="2072" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="2073" who="S0084">to engage your brain again having worked in a shop for three years and it was great and I just I've just really really enjoyed it and been busy all the time and uh I spoke to my mum and I got up doing this and doing that we went to this and you know we're doing that and I'm going to the theatre tonight and you know cos my friend Al worked there so I stayed there all the time and could meet all the people backstage and it sounds very exciting it was a really exciting life and I guess when I moved to Cambridge it all stopped <pause dur="short"/> just like it is whenever you finish uni you just think</u>
<u n="2074" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="2075" who="S0084">is this it now?</u>
<u n="2076" who="S0041">is this what I was training for all this time?</u>
<u n="2077" who="S0084">hmm <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="2078" who="S0041">is this what I'm given?</u>
<u n="2079" who="S0084">so I've come out with like eight grand worth of debt <pause dur="short"/> so like my career development language the loan I took out to pay for my masters cos I went travelling and it wasn't until I got back in like the June I said maybe I should do something with my life oh my God let's do a masters well I can start in September <pause dur="short"/> brilliant I haven't got any money took out a loan and I took out  took out  eight grand I think took out ten took out enough money five grand for my tuition fees and three grand for living living cost and then I worked so that I could afford to eat</u>
<u n="2080" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="2081" who="S0084">um but it's a five year repayment plan from a hundred and fifty pounds a month</u>
<u n="2082" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="2083" who="S0084">so I've only done two and a half years <pause dur="short"/> I still have two and a half to go</u>
<u n="2084" who="S0041">I think it's manageable is it? <trunc>It</trunc> it's manageable but</u>
<u n="2085" who="S0084">it's not a ridiculous amount but when you think you've got rent</u>
<u n="2086" who="S0041">I know</u>
<u n="2087" who="S0084">you've got student loan and food and</u>
<u n="2088" who="S0041">I'm paying <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s mum a hundred and twenty-five a month</u>

<u n="2090" who="S0041">yup</u>
<u n="2091" who="S0084">for how much longer?</u>
<u n="2092" who="S0041">I don't really know <pause dur="short"/> I loaned three grand</u>
<u n="2093" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="2094" who="S0041">I've been paying it back cos I bought the car October November December January February March <pause dur="short"/> so basically a year and a half</u>
<u n="2095" who="S0084">wow</u>
<u n="2096" who="S0041">I've been paying about what's that?</u>
<u n="2097" who="S0084">over a hundred and twenty-five pounds a month? You must be nearly there</u>
<u n="2098" who="S0041">for twelve months <pause dur="short"/> say say fifteen months cos I've I don't think we started paying it did I start paying it back till Christmas?</u>
<u n="2099" who="S0084">if you think a hundred pounds a month</u>
<u n="2100" who="S0041">and she let me missed one you know</u>
<u n="2101" who="S0084">hmm <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="2102" who="S0041">back at Christmas I didn't pay her on Christmas and she was like no that's fine <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> tell <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> she doesn't have to pay over Christmas</u>
<u n="2103" who="S0084">nice</u>
<u n="2104" who="S0041">she wouldn't let me pay <pause dur="short"/> it must be hard</u>
<u n="2105" who="S0084">if it was a hundred</u>
<u n="2106" who="S0041">so</u>

<u n="2110" who="S0041">so it's probably going to be two years</u>
<u n="2111" who="S0084">it's going to be two</u>
<u n="2112" who="S0041">and I'll probably pay it back in a year</u>
<u n="2113" who="S0084">two years <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="2114" who="S0041">I'll probably be doing this for another year which is fine <pause dur="short"/> I mean to be honest I've if if I'm going to start navy then I'll just bulk pay half</u>
<u n="2115" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="2116" who="S0041">uh um but also I owe my friend <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> about four hundred pounds or five hundred pounds which I thought I had paid off <pause dur="short"/> he's just kept to himself all this time cos basically when I moved down here I had a grand savings</u>

<u n="2469" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> definitely <pause dur="short"/> maybe they'll do you a special deal <pause dur="short"/> probably cos actually they in fact I know they do because like my friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> her brother's just joined the navy navy officially had his passing out in December and he gets a specialty with Volvo specialty with Hewitt Packard <pause dur="short"/> what else does he get a special deal with? Lots of big manufacturers do deals with the navy <pause dur="short"/> uh well armed forces in general</u>
<u n="2470" who="S0041">you probably need to ask him how difficult that training was?</u>
<u n="2471" who="S0084">very difficult <pause dur="short"/> but he left it <pause dur="short"/> did he get he didn't get gangrene <pause dur="short"/> he got something really bad like foot wart like really really bad when he was doing his training <pause dur="short"/> he got some sort of leg injury and he's a bit of a psycho <pause dur="short"/> he <trunc>l</trunc> kept pushing himself and they were like no your leg might fall off you probably shouldn't do the thing now <pause dur="short"/> I think he</u>
<u n="2472" who="S0041">oh God</u>
<u n="2473" who="S0084">cos he went in but not in as an <trunc>of</trunc> in as an officer and he loves it and it <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s now dating his one of his mates from the navy <pause dur="short"/> but Will her brother didn't know for ages like it's quite funny</u>

<u n="2478" who="S0041" trans="overlap">how much <unclear/> cos I mean if we're anything above an eight I'm really quite scared</u>
<u n="2479" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's good to go into these things with your eyes open I suppose? I don't know whether they <unclear/> the <anon type="place"/> assessment <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who I love <pause dur="short"/> he's just also just joined the navy but the year before so his passing out was the Christmas before so he's been in the navy for a <trunc>y</trunc> just over a year but he went to university to train to be a pilot <pause dur="short"/> so he's got a pilot's degree</u>
<u n="2480" who="S0041">oh</u>

<u n="2482" who="S0041">shit</u>
<u n="2483" who="S0084">because he was doing that when we worked at <anon type="place"/> assessment <pause dur="short"/> he had one more year to go and I just thought that's a fuck load of money and he's like it's okay because when you graduate that first year out of uh uni you'll be earning a hundred grand and I thought okay so what do they like guarantee you work? And he was like there's always work <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> there were no there were no jobs</u>
<u n="2484" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> when he came out</u>

<u n="2486" who="S0041">hmm</u>
<u n="2487" who="S0084">and sort of got one ahead of everybody else</u>

<u n="2491" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="2492" who="S0041">and how difficult he found the English bit and I was like no I found that bit the easiest it was the mechanical engineering bit that I found hard</u>
<u n="2493" who="S0084">hmm</u>
<u n="2494" who="S0041">and he was like oh yeah I have got an engineering degree though <pause dur="short"/> so I was like uh a bit of a head start there mate</u>

<u n="2498" who="S0041">it's unfair <pause dur="short"/> it's an unfair advantage</u>
<u n="2499" who="S0084">it's a massive <trunc>ad</trunc> disadvantage for you</u>
<u n="2500" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so I thought actually the other day when I was at the pub I need to think of the answer to the question why do you want to join the navy? Cos I have no answer</u>

<u n="2507" who="S0084">all these people that I actually know weirdly <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="2508" who="S0041">say why did you join the navy? And we're going to steal one of their perfect answers <pause dur="short"/> cos I mean they've already been indoctrinated with this now are they?</u>

<u n="2515" who="S0084">okay <pause dur="short"/> well that sounds fine</u>
<u n="2516" who="S0041">Cos there's no real reason <pause dur="short"/> it's just going to be hard <pause dur="short"/> it's just sounds like an adventure and it's hard and the money's great and</u>
<u n="2517" who="S0084">hmm</u>
