<u n="1605" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="1606" who="S0008">so he he started doing that and er stuck em in his steamer mm didn't seem to work very well so he he bought a new yet another wallpaper <trunc>d</trunc> steamer thing</u>
<u n="1607" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1608" who="S0008">to provide more steam you got these immaculate sort of like long box what he's made lined with you know insulation and stuff like that and</u>
<u n="1609" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1610" who="S0008">which the steam goes in the wood all and er so he improved that so he got more hot hotter and er that didn't work and then he chucked all his wood in his pond so it got you know</u>
<u n="1611" who="S0012">wet yeah</u>
<u n="1612" who="S0008">wet</u>
<u n="1613" who="S0013">mm</u>

<u n="1623" who="S0008">and er he's tried a couple of times</u>
<u n="1624" who="S0012" trans="overlap">cor I'd've loved to have been in there and heard the blue air</u>
<u n="1625" who="S0008">he tried that a couple of times and er he just can't get this wood to bend</u>
<u n="1626" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="1627" who="S0008">and er <vocal desc="cough"/> then he was couldn't work out why why it wasn't working you know and this is the thing you know I mean it should work</u>
<u n="1628" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah it should yeah</u>
<u n="1629" who="S0008">and so why isn't it working? and after much searching and on the internet</u>
<u n="1630" who="S0012">it was cutting the wrong grain I suppose</u>

<u n="1643" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1644" who="S0008">then once it's kiln dried you know the moisture isn't gonna affect it at all because it's</u>
<u n="1645" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="1646" who="S0008">chemically set</u>
