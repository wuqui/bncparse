<u n="386" who="S0324" trans="overlap">deal</u>
<u n="387" who="S0325">it's probably just because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is so annoyed at Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> for not letting her come on sailing</u>
<u n="388" who="S0324" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="389" who="S0325" trans="overlap">that she really just wants to</u>
