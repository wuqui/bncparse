<u n="10" who="S0654">mm hm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0653">she says you find it you know you haven't quite decided the best way to work things out so you're always a little bit concerned but she said that'll be fine you'll come on no problems at all and that she loved how much you liked studying George Stevenson</u>
<u n="12" who="S0654"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="13" who="S0653">whatever his name is <pause dur="short"/> so I'm both very I'm very proud of you both absolutely fantastic</u>

<u n="28" who="S0655">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I find times tables and division very difficult</u>
<u n="29" who="S0653">I know but if you practice them you'll get a bit better</u>
<u n="30" who="S0655">after all the way home <pause dur="short"/> all the way home <unclear/> forty-four questions in five minutes</u>

<u n="41" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0654">it's like dividing</u>
<u n="43" who="S0653">mm <pause dur="short"/> I find that hard too</u>
