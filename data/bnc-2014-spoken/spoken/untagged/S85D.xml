<u n="1777" who="S0344">he's on another level like he's always always having to do</u>
<u n="1778" who="S0336" trans="overlap">I feel like even even though you like having company that it's not always like oh we have to be doing stuff</u>

<u n="1804" who="S0345">he should be saving it</u>
<u n="1805" who="S0336" trans="overlap">and so what's happening is he's kind of he is he's spending it he's like oh I've got the money so I'll do this and I'll do that and I'll do if he was in a situation where he was a little bit more constricted that's when you start making the decisions oh well I won't go out as often cos I can't actually afford to do that</u>
