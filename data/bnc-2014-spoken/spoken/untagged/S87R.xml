<u n="136" who="S0432">yeah yeah do that</u>
<u n="137" who="S0503">and I'll have to get myself out of bed and it's hard to get him up when <unclear>he's not</unclear> if he's asleep honestly</u>
<u n="138" who="S0432">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="139" who="S0503"><unclear>got</unclear> to be earlier than him</u>
<u n="140" who="S0432">you've got to let mummy sleep through the night</u>
<u n="141" who="S0503">I'm scared he won't sleep through tonight cos he's only he's gonna have to have a feed cos he's had this at half four unless he has another one at like half six and half eight so he has sort of then that's only two hours between feeds</u>
<u n="142" who="S0432">so when does he usually have them like throughout the day?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0503">he has one say he has one at like five</u>
<u n="144" who="S0432">in the morning?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0503">yeah then like nine twelve three six and then like eight say on average</u>
<u n="146" who="S0432">like nine and twelve three six and eight</u>
<u n="147" who="S0503">but when he was waking up at about say two three o'clock he'd still have sometimes he'd have seven bottles other times he'd have a longer stretch between so he wouldn't have like three-hour gaps so</u>
<u n="148" who="S0432">mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0503">he was still getting sort of six to seven bottles</u>
<u n="150" who="S0432">yeah so before he was having one between like eight and five <pause dur="short"/> at night?</u>
<u n="151" who="S0503" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no so he has his last one like originally his times were like for sleeping through on the night say he goes to bed at say eight he'd wake up at like sort of two-ish and then it started going to three and then this past week he's started going until five</u>
<u n="152" who="S0432">oh okay so he</u>
<u n="153" who="S0503" trans="overlap">but then last night he slept through until seven so he's not had that night feed so he's not had as many feeds today</u>
<u n="154" who="S0432">oh yeah I see yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0503">like but sometimes when he's slept like if he woke up say at about three so he had one at three in the morning <pause dur="short"/> five <pause dur="short"/> then like sort of nine twelve <pause dur="short"/> four <pause dur="short"/> maybe <trunc>s</trunc> well yeah he'd usually have sort of like oh I can't work it out cos I'm too tired</u>
<u n="156" who="S0432" trans="overlap">I can't even <vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm sorry did I scare did you see him?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0503">no</u>
<u n="158" who="S0432">he just went</u>
<u n="159" who="S0503">oh he was startled</u>
<u n="160" who="S0432">sorry was that too loud?</u>
<u n="161" who="S0503">yeah but he'd usually have sort of seven to six bottles but recently it's been six because he's going that little bit longer at night without one</u>
<u n="162" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0503">because he went from seven last night today it's been seven ten and one sort of four so maybe like seven seven and that's only five bottles and that's an earlier bottle as well so unless I can try and squeeze another one in between now and sort of eight so he has sort of two-hour gaps between them</u>
<u n="164" who="S0432" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0503">rather than three</u>
<u n="166" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0503">cos otherwise I'm not I don't know if he'll sleep through because he's had like there's seven ounces less than usual</u>
<u n="168" who="S0432" trans="overlap">so he's had four so far today?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0503">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0432">but by this time he would have had five or six?</u>
<u n="171" who="S0503" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0432">no five</u>
<u n="173" who="S0503">yeah</u>
<u n="174" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="175" who="S0503">so I'm not</u>
<u n="176" who="S0432" trans="overlap">so he's only got one more to fit in?</u>
<u n="177" who="S0503">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0432">technically</u>
<u n="179" who="S0503">really but then say he starts getting hungry about like half six cos he hasn't seemed to have been lasting three hours today for some reason erm <pause dur="short"/> so he might still want the same amount of he might think I've slept through but I still want the same amount that I would have had</u>
<u n="180" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah mm</u>
<u n="181" who="S0503">so the gaps are getting shorter sort of thing cos I gave him eight ounces this morning which he like drank all of but then the ten o'clock one I did another eight but he only had six</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="182" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="183" who="S0503">so then it averages out at seven ounces anyway so then I've just made</u>
<u n="184" who="S0432" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="185" who="S0503">seven-ounce ones at one and four</u>
<u n="186" who="S0432">but he had six is that what you're saying?</u>
<u n="187" who="S0503">no he usually has seven</u>
<u n="188" who="S0432" trans="overlap">I'm slightly lost oh okay</u>
<u n="189" who="S0503">he has seven all day apart from eight before bed but like because he'd gone so long last night I gave him eight this morning <unclear/> but then the next morning he only had six so it still averages out at seven</u>
<u n="190" who="S0432">oh okay I see yeah</u>
<u n="191" who="S0503">so it's not because I was gonna try and give him an extra ounce in every feed so that he's not technically missing a bottle and gave him</u>
<u n="192" who="S0432" trans="overlap">but he just wasn't drinking?</u>
<u n="193" who="S0503">yeah <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="194" who="S0432">you know what she's doing</u>
<u n="195" who="S0503" trans="overlap">so I may try and fit another feed in</u>
<u n="196" who="S0432" trans="overlap">you're just gonna wake him up at two in the morning? <pause dur="short"/> mm?</u>
<u n="197" who="S0503">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that is the thing like if he wakes in the night now I'm not gonna know whether like I said whether it's cos we've been at <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <pause dur="short"/> like he's not gonna have like a bottle feed like I don't know <trunc>whe</trunc>where he's gonna sleep</u>
<u n="198" who="S0432">yeah you don't know if it's like disruption of</u>
<u n="199" who="S0503" trans="overlap">and like he's gonna be in the lounge as well</u>
<u n="200" who="S0432">routine</u>
<u n="201" who="S0503" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="202" who="S0432">going to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> or the fact that he slept so well last night and missed a bottle</u>
<u n="203" who="S0503">yeah</u>
<u n="204" who="S0432">what do you think? <pause dur="short"/> what do you think?</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="205" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="206" who="S0503">because like as I said I don't know what's happened with like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <unclear/> this morning they slept through and she said she was like I'm so jealous she was like erm she was like I'm starting to think am I doing something wrong? I said to be honest I don't think we've done anything differently like he has a lot of milk and they do say that when they get to certain weights they like drop a feed so it might be that he's dropping the night feed</u>
<u n="207" who="S0432">yeah so he might be alright anyway</u>
<u n="208" who="S0503">yeah but then also I said it could just be a phase like I don't expect I still expect him to get up at like two o'clock so anything later is a bonus really</u>
<u n="209" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="210" who="S0503">because otherwise I'd be really like gutted if he started waking up at like three again</u>
<u n="211" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="212" who="S0503">erm</u>
<u n="213" who="S0432">he's just got the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> gene and likes sleeping all the time don't you?</u>
<u n="214" who="S0503" trans="overlap">but erm</u>
<u n="215" who="S0432">just like your aunties and your grandparents</u>
<u n="216" who="S0503">yeah then she was saying like oh I've got him into such a routine and she was like I don't know if it's just routine for him waking up and I'm like it's probably the problem</u>
<u n="217" who="S0432">what? does she wake him up?</u>
<u n="218" who="S0503">no but like <pause dur="short"/> because like his routine in the day is like is the same every single day with nap times and food times every single day is exactly the same</u>
<u n="219" who="S0432" trans="overlap">oh is it?</u>
<u n="220" who="S0503">times and stuff so it's like well then his it probably is a routine for him whereas his nap times in the day if he's awake and happy I'll leave him awake when I know he starts getting tired I'll try and get him to sleep if he's hungry like less than three hours I don't like to give him too much but if he's really screaming I'd be like well sod it you're gonna have to have it then</u>
<u n="221" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="222" who="S0503" trans="overlap">or if he goes a little bit longer between a feed I'll let him go a bit longer</u>
<u n="223" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="224" who="S0503">so it's not like</u>
<u n="225" who="S0432">yeah like he's like dictating it to you</u>
<u n="226" who="S0503">yeah like I think with</u>
<u n="227" who="S0432" trans="overlap">which is not a bad thing I don't think</u>
<u n="228" who="S0503" trans="overlap">no I mean I know eventually we'll have we'll have to start trying again into some sort of routine but</u>
<u n="229" who="S0432" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> yeah but right now I think</u>
<u n="230" who="S0503" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="231" who="S0432">you seem to be doing it well</u>
<u n="232" who="S0503">I'm just sort of listening to him at the minute and</u>
<u n="233" who="S0432" trans="overlap">he's happy</u>
<u n="234" who="S0503">he's like been like like like I said I don't think we've done anything differently for him to sleep through he's just started going a little bit longer cos every morning we'll wake up and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will be like what time have you fed him? and I'll be like I haven't yet</u>
<u n="235" who="S0432">really?</u>

<u n="244" who="S0503">he doesn't sometimes</u>
<u n="245" who="S0432">oh God <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="246" who="S0503">most of the time he does but <trunc>becau</trunc> he used to when I used to make it all like fresh and stuff but I've stopped doing that now</u>
