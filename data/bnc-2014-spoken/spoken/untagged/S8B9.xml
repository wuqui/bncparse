<u n="46" who="S0453" trans="overlap">I know yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0454">after yesterday I'm upset but maybe that was a good thing for writing the list</u>
<u n="48" who="S0453">yeah I think that</u>
<u n="49" who="S0454">it was er I haven't held back</u>
<u n="50" who="S0453">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well that's good well I I'm gonna take a slightly different approach but I'll explain it to you cos er it might not surprise you to <vocal desc="cough"/> discover that I had another <pause dur="short"/> shift of direction from the list <pause dur="short"/> when I was thinking about it last night erm you you are eating okay and like everything's okay?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0454">just get on with it</u>
<u n="52" who="S0453">okay okay well basically erm <trunc>w</trunc>when I was putting it together I I thought <trunc>w</trunc>why am I doing this? you know why am I? this it's a bit it's a bit like a character assassination</u>
<u n="53" who="S0454">yeah it is</u>
<u n="54" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I wondered what you were up to</u>
<u n="56" who="S0453">yeah so I would rather not do that</u>
<u n="57" who="S0454">okay good</u>
<u n="58" who="S0453">okay but but it was <trunc>helpf</trunc></u>
<u n="59" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you've already done it now though</u>
<u n="60" who="S0453">yeah I know I've done it for myself but so I'm I'm not going to go through the items but I <trunc>wha</trunc>what I'll I <trunc>thi</trunc> what matters is the <trunc>ma</trunc> the end result really and what it cos what it's</u>
<u n="61" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it sounds like you just want an excuse</u>
<u n="62" who="S0453">no I don't want</u>
<u n="63" who="S0454" trans="overlap">to end things</u>
<u n="64" who="S0453">no I don't want an excuse to end things can I just finish?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0454" trans="overlap">in which case</u>
<u n="66" who="S0453">let me finish one second</u>
<u n="67" who="S0454">this is pointless</u>
<u n="68" who="S0453">no hang on one second I where it is helpful is in organising my own thoughts and just getting to the bottom of how I feel which is obviously a problem for me erm because on Saturday I was <pause dur="short"/> you know blowing one way and then yesterday I blew another way but it it's true I've I'm not you know I've not erm been really in touch with how I felt and I've been poor at articulating it erm but what this what this leads me to the you know the items there what I found I was doing is I was kind of you know I found that was prioritising stuff that involved us doing things apart and things that and you said it yourself when you moved here that you felt like you were in a relationship with someone who <pause dur="short"/> who wants to continue living their single life</u>
<u n="69" who="S0454">exactly</u>
<u n="70" who="S0453">you know and and doesn't doesn't want to compromise and</u>
<u n="71" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0453" trans="overlap">there's probably and there's <trunc>probab</trunc></u>
<u n="73" who="S0454" trans="overlap">like that first week I was here that was really obvious when I wasn't at work</u>
<u n="74" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0454">and you didn't want to move your schedule even for one week</u>
<u n="76" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0454" trans="overlap">with your gym and football and this and that</u>
<u n="78" who="S0453" trans="overlap">or compromise yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you know it was really kind of like obvious you didn't really want me as part of your life you just wanted to</u>
<u n="80" who="S0453">do my thing</u>
<u n="81" who="S0454">do your thing in which case why did I move here? we could have just</u>
<u n="82" who="S0453" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0454" trans="overlap">carried on what we were doing before or just ended it</u>
<u n="84" who="S0453">yeah well I so what this has led me to conclude <pause dur="short"/> now I'm telling you the two options because I genuinely don't know which one of them applies is either I've been <trunc>alo</trunc>alone so long</u>
<u n="85" who="S0454">mm this is part of the problem</u>
<u n="86" who="S0453"><trunc>y</trunc><trunc>yo</trunc></u>
<u n="87" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that unfortunately you get stuck in your ways</u>
<u n="88" who="S0453">yeah I've been alone so long and I've been not involved in a relationship for so long erm that I can't really do it and I all I know is and and it's made me selfish in a way</u>
<u n="89" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0453">because it's made me less</u>
<u n="91" who="S0454">I put that</u>
<u n="92" who="S0453">yeah cognisant of other people's wants and desires</u>
<u n="93" who="S0454">I put that too</u>
<u n="94" who="S0453">erm but by the way you know no matter what you think and no matter not withstanding that conversation yesterday I do love and I do care about you and the reason this is difficult for me as well as you is because of the upset that I'm causing you and the reason that I felt like shit for two weeks this is what I wanted to make clear was because I've made you you feel like shit and I knew it and my enduring memory was just seeing you <trunc>ups</trunc> really upset that was the last time I saw you that was the <trunc>la</trunc> until <trunc>th</trunc> until Saturday evening</u>
<u n="95" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0453">so that's <trunc>th</trunc>that and so the reason I felt buoyed at the start of yesterday when I <trunc>we</trunc> when I went to work and I had lots of energy was because I was <trunc>re</trunc> this is what I think was going on in my head is I was reassured that you're okay and I thought thank god she seems alright that's what</u>
<u n="97" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0453" trans="overlap">that's the what I think the <trunc>la</trunc> a big part of the relief was</u>
<u n="99" who="S0454">I'm always alright</u>
<u n="100" who="S0453">I know you're resilient I know you're resilient but I also know that you're very you know er more than you'd like to admit you have got feelings and emotions and</u>
<u n="101" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm but I'm much stronger than other people I've realised a lot stronger</u>
<u n="102" who="S0453">oh without doubt you're <trunc>b</trunc> probably much stronger than me so</u>
<u n="103" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I am</u>
<u n="104" who="S0453">yeah well anyway that <trunc>le</trunc> going back to the options one option is that I've been alone so long that I've been I'm just I just can't hack living with someone and can't hack compromise and basically find that <trunc>pre</trunc></u>
<u n="105" who="S0454" trans="overlap">not that you can't hack it it's you're not prepared to try it's this black or white there's nothing in between for you like it's gotta be like your ideal little world</u>
<u n="106" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="107" who="S0454" trans="overlap">perfect relationship which of course doesn't exist for anybody anywhere beyond a couple of days</u>
<u n="108" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="109" who="S0454">or there's nothing there's no in between stage and also that you can't see that things are temporal that you can go through really really good times with someone</u>
<u n="110" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0454">and then you can go downhill because something's happened</u>
<u n="112" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0454">maybe not even outside maybe just complacency making people lazy and then it can pick up again and that's</u>
<u n="114" who="S0453" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0454">normal in a relationship it's not like a straight line a relationship</u>
<u n="116" who="S0453">I know that</u>
<u n="117" who="S0454">it's not even just you start really high and then you go downhill and then you plateau it's not like that if you drew a graph of it it's much more variable</u>
<u n="118" who="S0453">mm <pause dur="short"/> I know well that brings me then to the second item which is when I was putting together the list I wondered whether because I'm prioritising stuff that really involves time apart</u>
<u n="119" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0453">in one way or another in this list whether it might be specific to me to to me and you an incompatibility between us underneath that we've both really glossed over on the way because of the way we are</u>
<u n="121" who="S0454">so you're prioritising you need to spend more time alone</u>
<u n="122" who="S0453">well the one of it's alone one of it's some of it's with friends some of it's you know meeting new people and doing stuff</u>
<u n="123" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but this I've already told you so many times</u>
<u n="124" who="S0453" trans="overlap">yeah I know</u>
<u n="125" who="S0454">like cos I can see you're not making any effort</u>
<u n="126" who="S0453">I know</u>
<u n="127" who="S0454">you haven't made any effort to make new friends in this whole year</u>
<u n="128" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0454">you've met no one</u>
<u n="130" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0454">and you haven't tried</u>
<u n="132" who="S0453">that's true</u>
<u n="133" who="S0454">and I've asked you over and over again so many times <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> make sure you put aside a day a week at least to see friends and make friends but you don't you put aside time to go to the gym alone</u>
<u n="134" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0454" trans="overlap">for several hours you put aside time to go to football that's not a social event that's a sporting event that involves no talking essentially other than pass the ball oh you dickhead</u>
<u n="136" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0454">that's a that's not a social activity so that's three nights a week gone</u>
<u n="138" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0454">and then</u>
<u n="140" who="S0453" trans="overlap">I know but that's</u>
<u n="141" who="S0454" trans="overlap">we spend an evening or two together</u>
<u n="142" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and then usually we see one of your friends you know which have sometimes become mutual friends now <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and whatever</u>
<u n="144" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0454"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> six but that that other night</u>
<u n="146" who="S0453">yeah I know</u>
<u n="147" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you you didn't make an effort any effort in a year I can't believe it and you say you're really sociable</u>
<u n="148" who="S0453" trans="overlap">you're right</u>
<u n="149" who="S0454">but yet you've even when I've asked you you need to do this</u>
<u n="150" who="S0453">yeah I know</u>
<u n="151" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and it's abnormal you don't know very many people here</u>
<u n="152" who="S0453">I think the reason is probably deep down that I don't really feel a connection with <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="153" who="S0454">but this is a</u>
<u n="154" who="S0453">I know</u>
<u n="155" who="S0454" trans="overlap">counterproductive thing</u>
<u n="156" who="S0453" trans="overlap">it's exactly</u>
<u n="157" who="S0454" trans="overlap">because you don't make</u>
<u n="158" who="S0453" trans="overlap">it's it's <trunc>k</trunc> chicken and egg exactly</u>
<u n="159" who="S0454" trans="overlap">friends and you don't they don't invite you places</u>
<u n="160" who="S0453" trans="overlap">people I don't feel happier</u>
<u n="161" who="S0454">and then you don't</u>
<u n="162" who="S0453" trans="overlap">absolutely</u>
<u n="163" who="S0454" trans="overlap">have new experiences</u>
<u n="164" who="S0453" trans="overlap">you're absolutely right</u>
<u n="165" who="S0454" trans="overlap">then it just becomes like work</u>
<u n="166" who="S0453">a vicious cycle</u>
<u n="167" who="S0454" trans="overlap">gym</u>
<u n="168" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="169" who="S0454">home</u>
<u n="170" who="S0453">and also part of it</u>
<u n="171" who="S0454" trans="overlap">maybe see <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> sometimes but it's just boring it's just</u>
<u n="172" who="S0453">yeah and it's</u>
<u n="173" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you're not doing anything new</u>
<u n="174" who="S0453">no</u>
<u n="175" who="S0454" trans="overlap">even though they're nice people it's not that</u>
<u n="176" who="S0453">no</u>
<u n="177" who="S0454" trans="overlap">they're lovely it's just</u>
<u n="178" who="S0453" trans="overlap">it's meeting new people it's making the connections</u>
<u n="179" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you know them and</u>

<u n="184" who="S0453" trans="overlap"><unclear>down the</unclear></u>
<u n="185" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and you can't see them every week</u>
<u n="186" who="S0453">yeah no I can't well the other thing is erm <pause dur="short"/> the other thing is I think it's maybe with half an eye on moving back home</u>
<u n="187" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0453" trans="overlap">and seeing this place as a temporary thing</u>
<u n="189" who="S0454">yeah I think I felt that too here</u>
<u n="190" who="S0453">I <trunc>kn</trunc> mm</u>
<u n="191" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that I haven't made a made a lot of effort in <anon type="place"/> to make friends cos it was really exciting and it was new and there were all these places I wanted to go and see and it wasn't the kind of thing you can do on your own like going to mountains or camping you just can't do those things on your own so I made a lot of effort and of course I met people who you know eventually were similarly minded to me</u>
<u n="192" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="193" who="S0454">so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> likes travelling in the Gulf and</u>
<u n="194" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="195" who="S0454" trans="overlap">in the Middle East that was great that he likes the <unclear>high end</unclear> stuff then I had people like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who you know liked slumming it a bit and</u>
<u n="196" who="S0453" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="197" who="S0454" trans="overlap"><trunc>wou</trunc> but was really up for an adventure just getting in a car and literally going left or right until we hit the end left or right until</u>
<u n="198" who="S0453" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0454">we'd found somewhere completely new and off the beaten track but it was because I made the effort to meet enough people</u>
<u n="200" who="S0453">to have that</u>
<u n="201" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that I ran into people who</u>
<u n="202" who="S0453">you liked</u>

<u n="250" who="S0453" trans="overlap">yeah that's how I started the day now I can explain all of that the sleep I did sleep better and er like is said it was because I was reassured that you were okay that that was the big reason why I felt like shit because I knew that the impact that I had on your emotions not not not mm mm you know not out of spite but because of what I'd <trunc>dec</trunc>decided was was in our in in both of our interests even though you know obviously it was unilateral and in <trunc>f</trunc> in your view we didn't discuss it we you</u>

<u n="257" who="S0454">well that wasn't really a conversation that was you informing me</u>
<u n="258" who="S0453">well and I informed you and then you er you said <trunc>s</trunc> you said something the next day on this on er not the next day on Saturday morning when we were you know <trunc>y</trunc>you you talked</u>
<u n="259" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it was already announced</u>

<u n="262" who="S0453" trans="overlap">I know but I know er</u>
<u n="263" who="S0454" trans="overlap">we broke up and then there was fallout</u>
<u n="264" who="S0453">I know</u>
<u n="265" who="S0454" trans="overlap">there was no discussion</u>
<u n="266" who="S0453">let</u>
<u n="267" who="S0454" trans="overlap">at any point</u>
<u n="268" who="S0453">let me just explain the good night's sleep was because when I saw you on Saturday evening <pause dur="short"/> that helped remove a lot of guilt from me because it made me realise that you were alright and</u>
<u n="269" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="270" who="S0453" trans="overlap">your life was going on</u>
<u n="271" who="S0454">yeah of course</u>
<u n="272" who="S0453">yeah so that that is where that came from and honestly I think that's the the big part of the reason why I felt like shit the the other thing when I said I might bring my was a combination of factors A because earlier in the day I was buoyed and that clouded my judgement about the the fact that my guilt had gone that was the real reason that I felt better it was because I felt less guilty but it wasn't because <pause dur="short"/> you know I was desperate to get back in here <pause dur="short"/> which is what the reason should be that's the reason I should be that's the reason I should</u>
<u n="273" who="S0454">desperate no why would you</u>
<u n="274" who="S0453" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="275" who="S0454">feel desperate?</u>

<u n="277" who="S0454" trans="overlap">this is an odd word</u>
<u n="278" who="S0453" trans="overlap">no not desperate not not desperate but because</u>
<u n="279" who="S0454">you shouldn't feel desperate</u>
<u n="280" who="S0453" trans="overlap">mm not desperate but I should feel that I miss being here with you right? that's how I should <trunc>fee</trunc></u>
<u n="281" who="S0454" trans="overlap">don't you think it's going to if we move back in together it would be difficult for a while and it's natural that we all feel apprehensive when we knowingly walk into a difficult situation and set ourselves up for that? whereas avoiding stuff</u>
<u n="282" who="S0453">I know</u>
<u n="283" who="S0454" trans="overlap">like you're doing</u>
<u n="284" who="S0453">yeah I I</u>
<u n="285" who="S0454" trans="overlap">is obviously easier even though we feel guilty about it so maybe in the long run the effect is the same you can't get away from these negative feelings if you have any kind of conscience</u>
<u n="286" who="S0453">I I agreed <trunc>ye</trunc> and I agree</u>
<u n="287" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so it's not so much that you should feel desperate</u>
<u n="288" who="S0453">no</u>
<u n="289" who="S0454" trans="overlap">to get back here or even excited as you said on the phone <pause dur="short"/> no why would you feel excited about</u>

<u n="1521" who="S0453">but but in but in either case in either case whether it's me or us erm no one is to blame here you're not to blame the language I've heard from you recently and and the language I'm still hearing from you is is almost as if to assuage your guilt about about feeling that you might not have done enough nobody's no one's done anything wrong here well you know there may be differences of opinion about that with you but you've not done anything wrong I don't want you to feel like <trunc>somethi</trunc> you I don't want you to beat yourself up about things and think if only I'd done that and if only I'd done that that's not that's not that's I don't want you to think like that I don't want you to beat yourself up about things because no one's to blame here this is just this is just how our characters have have interacted for two years and and this is the end product it's not this is not you did things wrong and you did that that's what I really don't want you to think like that because then you're gonna be eaten up by guilt in the same way that I was I've been I've been being eaten up by guilt by <trunc>brea</trunc> for breaking up with you so you <trunc>migh</trunc> you can't think like that and if you do want to move on then you're gonna have to abandon that kind of thinking that's one</u>

<u n="1638" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1639" who="S0453" trans="overlap">that's what I'm learning from this whole experience</u>

<u n="1660" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I'd actually respect you more</u>
<u n="1661" who="S0453">but if I felt differently then I would be fighting for it but you you what you need to recognise is this is indicative of how I feel</u>

<u n="1673" who="S0453" trans="overlap">no the reason okay what that means is I find I mean you know I find myself I found myself looking forward as a as a taking the Columbian thing <trunc>lo</trunc><trunc>lo</trunc> enjoy you know looking forward more to these events and or you know spending time around these complete strangers than spending time with you</u>
<u n="1674" who="S0454">but that's because we spent too much time together</u>
<u n="1675" who="S0453">possibly er possibly I don't know that's</u>

<u n="1677" who="S0453">all I know is my judgement about things <vocal desc="sigh"/> feels clouded <pause dur="short"/> and the reason why I that's not normal for me I'm normally quite a decisive guy I'm normally someone who doesn't beat about the bush I'm not someone who goes in twenty-four hours from blowing one way to blowing another I'm normally really decisive I never have problems with making decisions right? but the reason I did is obviously because something fucking complex is going on in there and that complex thing is toying with things and on the one hand dealing with the guilt of having ended it with you and hurt you clearly and on the other hand you know trying to trying to <vocal desc="sigh"/> get on with life but also give you know give you the reasons why I feel the relationship er er needs to end so</u>
<u n="1678" who="S0454">none of those were very powerful reasons</u>

<u n="1682" who="S0454">they are all things that could have been sorted out and they were all things nearly all of them were things I'd already suggested and asked you repeatedly to do</u>

<u n="1723" who="S0453" trans="overlap">well because</u>
<u n="1724" who="S0454" trans="overlap">articulate some things that aren't right I agree with you</u>

<u n="1731" who="S0453" trans="overlap">can be well hang on can be worked on to an extent but can't be resolved that's how I feel</u>
