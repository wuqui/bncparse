<u n="535" who="S0517"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="536" who="S0558"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="537" who="S0517">was it your suggestion then?</u>
<u n="538" who="S0558"><vocal desc="cough"/> well I said to him why don't you try <anon type="place"/>? because <pause dur="short"/> I knew the manager that was that was there</u>
<u n="539" who="S0517">oh okay</u>
<u n="540" who="S0558">he used to be a neighbour of ours in <anon type="place"/> but he retired last year</u>

<u n="544" who="S0558">so he gave me the contact details of who we need to speak to erm and he's had an email back saying it's been sent his request has been sent on to the director and they'll get back to him with a decision</u>
<u n="545" who="S0517">oh right</u>
<u n="546" who="S0558">so maybe <anon type="place"/> but I thought it's it's gonna be like shuffling bits of wood around and different things and a bit of sweeping but it's a heavily male environment</u>
<u n="547" who="S0517" trans="overlap">it is yeah yeah</u>
<u n="548" who="S0558">so he'll have the banter and just</u>
<u n="549" who="S0517">mm</u>
<u n="550" who="S0558" trans="overlap">drop him in it and let him cope</u>
<u n="551" who="S0517">oh that's a good idea <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="552" who="S0558">yeah he that's what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> needs isn't it?</u>

<u n="557" who="S0517">oh</u>
<u n="558" who="S0558">which would be a lot more of a probably more suitable to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="559" who="S0517">mm be much quieter wouldn't it? and much more</u>
<u n="560" who="S0558" trans="overlap">yeah probably be more suitable to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s but I think <anon type="place"/> would be good</u>
<u n="561" who="S0517">be good for him yes</u>
<u n="562" who="S0558" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="563" who="S0517">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh you're quite harsh you <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you're a little bit devious aren't you?</u>

<u n="582" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="583" who="S0517" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would like to send him to because of the manager in place is the one at the <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> which is not a holiday park it's only a residential</u>
<u n="584" who="S0558" trans="overlap">residential isn't it?</u>
<u n="585" who="S0517">and even when when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> goes up there he has to he stays in a B and B there's nowhere er I think there are staff caravans but there's no nowhere to stay as such</u>
<u n="586" who="S0558">oh is that the manager who was there when we</u>

<u n="597" who="S0517" trans="overlap">well I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s spoken to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> but I think pretty much in effect <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would end up putting <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> up for the week</u>
<u n="598" who="S0558">mm</u>
<u n="599" who="S0517">which <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would be okay with</u>
