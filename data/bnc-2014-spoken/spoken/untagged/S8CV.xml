<u n="31" who="S0688">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0689">and erm apparently like it said it died on impact but he said that he had it said that like the bloke had to put his foot over it to stop like flapping about and making him</u>
<u n="33" who="S0688" trans="overlap">well what dead?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0687">the</u>
<u n="35" who="S0689" trans="overlap">the seagull</u>
<u n="36" who="S0688">yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0689">and he and it said like he he stuck his foot on its head basically to stop it flying around but so it said the die the bird died on impact but if it <trunc>st</trunc> if he stuck his er you know his foot on it then it doesn't really make sense does it?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0688">no</u>
<u n="39" who="S0687">where was that?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0689">in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0687">didn't know there were many <trunc>helico</trunc></u>
<u n="42" who="S0689" trans="overlap">well it might it might have been in the <anon type="place"/> evening news</u>
<u n="43" who="S0687" trans="overlap">didn't know there were many people with helicopters around <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="44" who="S0689">it might have been in the <anon type="place"/> evening news I can't remember I read both of them</u>
<u n="45" who="S0688">that could be dangerous a <trunc>heli</trunc> er if it got stuck in your in your propeller</u>
<u n="46" who="S0689">no I don't think it would make a big difference</u>
<u n="47" who="S0687">do you know it would?</u>
<u n="48" who="S0688" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0687">that's why they have airports <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> like when they were first doing when they first kind of starting to fly they had loads of problems with birds getting sucked into propellers and it causes the the propeller to explode and it crashes</u>
<u n="50" who="S0689">really? no but</u>
<u n="51" who="S0687" trans="overlap">yeah that's why at airports they have cars that drive around with like loud whizzers on them to drive away birds</u>
<u n="52" who="S0689">oh right</u>
<u n="53" who="S0687">the runways</u>
<u n="54" who="S0689">see I thought yeah but if a propeller it it goes so fast it'd just chop it up do you not think?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0687" trans="overlap">well you would think so but it it <trunc>d</trunc> I'm right aren't I dad? there's been cases where the</u>
<u n="56" who="S0690" trans="overlap">there have been cases yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0687">the birds have got into propellers and the plane's crashed</u>
<u n="58" who="S0690">but they can actually destroy jet engines believe it or not cos there's hundreds of fans in the middle er on the inside of a jet propulsion engine spinning around incredibly fast</u>
<u n="59" who="S0689">it must be a lot of force to get a like thousand is it? or normally tonnes it's probably a couple of <unclear/> plus all the</u>
<u n="60" who="S0690" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0689">baggage and all the people <pause dur="long"/></u>
