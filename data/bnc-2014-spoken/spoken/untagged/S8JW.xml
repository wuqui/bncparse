<u n="1290" who="S0040">yeah so I was looking at I was thinking well in theory the the cutting face bit <pause dur="short"/> doesn't really matter whether it's small or portable or a massive <pause dur="short"/> workshop one</u>
<u n="1291" who="S0095">mm</u>
<u n="1292" who="S0040">as long as it's got enough power to <pause dur="short"/> it's only that bit that interacts with whatever you're putting it into isn't it so?</u>
<u n="1293" who="S0095">yeah</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0040">but I was just wondering it's sort of like quite a lot of friction and stuff but like it's quite tight bends to get it into a hand-built unit</u>

<u n="1310" who="S0040">they've made a cordless one of those as well by the looks of it</u>

<u n="1313" who="S0095">yeah so</u>
<u n="1314" who="S0040">in fact I would say it's probably almost as useful as the drill</u>
<u n="1315" who="S0095">wow <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0040">just in terms of it's the thing that you most likely in my head it's the thing you're most likely to cut through the cable of</u>

<u n="1327" who="S0095">circular saws they're just a bit of a nightmare in a way</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0040">yeah so yeah it really can't cope with it the depth of cut on it er and if it if it even if <unclear>you're going</unclear> straight and true depth of cut is worse than the jigsaw in a way because you're trying to force a massive chunk through</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0095">mm <pause dur="short"/> then you're twisting</u>
