<u n="168" who="S0654">was that before the First World War?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0653">yeah cos that was about a hundred years ago wasn't it?</u>
<u n="170" who="S0655">no the Second World War was a hundred years ago</u>
<u n="171" who="S0653">no the First World War was a hundred years ago</u>
<u n="172" who="S0655">and how long ago was the Second World War?</u>
<u n="173" who="S0653">okay well the Second World War was in the <trunc>n</trunc>nineteen forties</u>
<u n="174" who="S0654">so not long?</u>
<u n="175" who="S0653">and it's two thousand and sixteen now so when it's two thousand and forty-two oh gosh I can't even well thirty-<trunc>n</trunc> nineteen thirty-nine is when it started so I can't do maths to work out how you're going to be when it's a hundred years er but yes anyway we're in we're in the time frame so the First World War ended nineteen eighteen so we've got two more years of remembering the First World War there are still people alive today who fought in the First World War you know?</u>
<u n="176" who="S0654" trans="overlap">wow they must be very old</u>
<u n="177" who="S0653">they are very old but they were some of them were very young when they</u>
<u n="178" who="S0655" whoConfidence="low">oh</u>
<u n="179" who="S0653">signed up to fight they lied and said that they were older so some of them were very very young indeed</u>
<u n="180" who="S0654" trans="overlap">so like thirteen?</u>
<u n="181" who="S0653">yeah and then they saw some awful awful things</u>
<u n="182" who="S0654">so they thought it would be a good were they bad people?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0653">no they were brave they wanted to fight for their country</u>
<u n="184" who="S0654">but then they were scared</u>
<u n="185" who="S0655">no they weren't</u>
<u n="186" who="S0653" trans="overlap">but then it was well war is a terrible thing but this particular war was horrific and it really did damage a lot of people</u>
<u n="187" who="S0654">yeah and do you know what?</u>
<u n="188" who="S0653">mm?</u>
<u n="189" who="S0654">I think that most of them they might be quite young so that if they did it</u>
<u n="190" who="S0653">mm?</u>
<u n="191" who="S0654" trans="overlap">then they'd be terrified they would be so shocked they might get a heart they might get erm</u>
<u n="192" who="S0655">a heart attack?</u>
<u n="193" who="S0654">heart attack</u>
<u n="194" who="S0653">well do you know what? I think it's amazing that so many of them are still alive and I think that it's almost like they lived through such a <trunc>horror</trunc>horrible thing that they wanted to kind of make the best of it and have managed to have a kind of a happy fulfilled life afterwards but lots of people who were in the First World War never spoke about what the things they terrible things they saw cos they couldn't really deal with it and they people didn't really understand how to <pause dur="short"/> help them or work out what was wrong with them and <pause dur="short"/> cos they it's <trunc>c</trunc> something called post-traumatic stress when you finish being in a war and then all the awful things you see you kind of your brain needs to process them and work them out they didn't really recognise that so lots of them ended up in hospitals but they weren't really treated properly it was very sad</u>
<u n="195" who="S0654">mm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0655">oi mum I don't really get what's going on in this Lego <unclear>ware</unclear></u>
