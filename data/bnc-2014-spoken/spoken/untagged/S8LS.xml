<u n="19" who="S0086">yeah it's a joke isn't it?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0171">it was</u>
<u n="21" who="S0060">I was like hang on we're going to pictures we're not buying the film</u>
<u n="22" who="S0171" trans="overlap">but it was  it was  a Saturday that we went <pause dur="short"/> it was a Saturday that we went so</u>
<u n="23" who="S0086" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="24" who="S0060">yeah I know but you know so</u>
<u n="25" who="S0086">and 3D is more expensive</u>
<u n="26" who="S0060">I can I mean I can remember back in the day when I used to go to the cinema a lot it was three pound or something</u>
<u n="27" who="S0086">I know <pause dur="short"/> gone are those days</u>
<u n="28" who="S0060">yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0171">or bargain Tuesday for seven pound fifty that's what I remember</u>
<u n="30" who="S0086">Tuesday's are still cheap <pause dur="short"/> cineworld is still cheaper on Tuesday <pause dur="short"/> and obviously Orange Wednesdays as well</u>
<u n="31" who="S0060" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> can't believe it was a tenner</u>
<u n="32" who="S0171"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> do you want a pint <trunc>gla</trunc> pint glass or a normal glass?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0086" trans="overlap">ooh that would be <pause dur="short"/> yeah a pint would be lovely my love</u>

<u n="35" who="S0086">was it?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0060">it wasn't  It wasn't</u>
<u n="37" who="S0171" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I didn't I wasn't all that keen on it actually</u>
<u n="38" who="S0060">but I don't know whether it's from a book but if it is I imagine the actual the story in the book would be a lot lot better <pause dur="short"/> the they didn't really <pause dur="short"/> they could have you know <pause dur="short"/> you could tell there was probably a lot more toe the story in different bits and they just sort of moved on cos the <pause dur="short"/> the story they're telling there wasn't a great deal to it</u>
<u n="39" who="S0086">really? It just sort of relied on the on how it looked</u>
<u n="40" who="S0060">yeah but no</u>
<u n="41" who="S0086">but Avatar was like that though <pause dur="short"/> they spent so much money on the effects that they just sort of forgot the story line <pause dur="short"/> I mean unobtainium</u>
<u n="42" who="S0060">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="43" who="S0086">how long did it take them to think that up? Two seconds <pause dur="short"/> it was essentially just Fern Gulley wasn't it? The twenty first century <pause dur="short"/> I mean I like Fern Gulley but you know I don't think it's ground breaking particularly but quite entertaining <pause dur="short"/> I think John Carter didn't it looked a lot like Star Wars? That sort of desert scene</u>
<u n="44" who="S0060">they've they've tried to sell to on saying it's the the Star Wars for the next generation <pause dur="short"/> but it's definitely not that</u>
<u n="45" who="S0086">it's not</u>
<u n="46" who="S0060">it's not <pause dur="short"/> it hasn't got the big sort of galaxies scope <pause dur="short"/> it's it's basically well they kind of <pause dur="short"/> there's there's a lot of in the first one is obviously where it sort of it if nothing else it's sort of setting a scene for a bigger story to come sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> em but even then it's not going to be anything <pause dur="short"/> yeah no</u>
<u n="47" who="S0086">anything on the same scale</u>
<u n="48" who="S0060">no</u>
<u n="49" who="S0086">well I meant to go and see the first Star Wars in 3D but I didn't get around to it <pause dur="short"/> it would have been really good on the big screen</u>
<u n="50" who="S0060">I went when eh <pause dur="short"/> when they brought out what was it? The second one</u>
<u n="51" who="S0086">the second new one</u>
<u n="52" who="S0060">yeah there was a <pause dur="short"/> you could go and watch the five back to back through the night kind of thing</u>
<u n="53" who="S0086">oh god</u>
<u n="54" who="S0060">it was  it was  when I was at college I think <pause dur="short"/> so we went and watched that through the night and it was like oh</u>
<u n="55" who="S0086">yeah I think they did that just recently with Harry Potter</u>
<u n="56" who="S0060">did they? Oh my god</u>
<u n="57" who="S0086">they did yeah <pause dur="short"/> my friend went to watch all five <pause dur="short"/> and one Saturday night they did like one to three and then they did four to six</u>
<u n="58" who="S0060">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0086">and then seven's in two bits isn't it so <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that was a bit epic cos they just get longer and longer</u>
<u n="60" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos I remember going to see the the eh Exorcist at midnight cos it when it had come back after having been banned</u>
<u n="61" who="S0086">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0060">it was I think that was my first year at eh at uni we all trooped off down to the cinema at whatever in the morning or or yeah it was the last showing sort of thing to watch the Exorcist <pause dur="short"/> and it was like comic <pause dur="short"/> it really was</u>
<u n="63" who="S0086">it hasn't aged well has it</u>
<u n="64" who="S0060">no no <pause dur="short"/> I mean it was that you know this film has been banned it had to come back <pause dur="short"/> we all trooped down there to watch it <pause dur="short"/> I don't  I don't  think I'd ever seen it before <pause dur="short"/> but I mean literally we were just in stitches laughing throughout the thing it was</u>
<u n="65" who="S0086">yeah it's not scary</u>
<u n="66" who="S0060">no</u>
<u n="67" who="S0086">it's funny that these things get banned <pause dur="short"/> but then I think <pause dur="short"/> I don't know whether it's because I hate masks but Texas Chainsaw Massacre <unclear/> but I think it's still really scary</u>
<u n="68" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you're right <pause dur="short"/> there's a new one coming out which is very much that sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> smiley <pause dur="short"/> it's called</u>

<u n="70" who="S0060">yeah</u>
<u n="71" who="S0086">is it mask <unclear/></u>
<u n="72" who="S0060">yeah its em <pause dur="short"/> very much of the sort of Scream Texas Chainsaw Massacre kind of thing <pause dur="short"/> it's all about <pause dur="short"/> and a bit like em I suppose IT and those kind of ones <pause dur="short"/> but it's of a his face is like</u>
<u n="73" who="S0171" trans="overlap">I'm going to start on the hard stuff</u>
<u n="74" who="S0086">oh nice</u>
<u n="75" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> as though he he's got no face and his eyes and his mouth are like cut into it with a knife or something so it's sort of a a sort of bloody cut on his face but it's just no face <pause dur="short"/> he's got the shape of a face but no features apart from these knife cuts to make his eyes and his mouth</u>
<u n="76" who="S0086">Jesus</u>
<u n="77" who="S0060">and it looks one of your films that does Smiley</u>
<u n="78" who="S0086">yeah you like a gruesome horror don't you?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0171">I do <pause dur="short"/> but I've never heard of Smiley</u>
<u n="80" who="S0060">yeah well it's a new one I've seen it advertised <pause dur="short"/> but eh <pause dur="short"/> that's a perfect <pause dur="short"/> I mean eh one of the little computer games we play Minecraft there's loads of YouTube videos of people playing it cos they build loads of stuff and it's you know all sort of creative stuff <pause dur="short"/> and because you do that the load cos they've got loads of subscribers and they've got loads of videos up <pause dur="short"/> they're part of YouTube so they get paid for it because they put adverts <pause dur="short"/> so there's always this you know you get five seconds before you can get to the video you want <pause dur="short"/> and so often it's an advert for a film and you ooh start and then you start looking at that and eh</u>
<u n="81" who="S0086">oh that's clever</u>
<u n="82" who="S0060">but eh but yeah that was one of the ones <pause dur="short"/> but there's some good ones</u>
<u n="83" who="S0086">Smiley</u>

<u n="85" who="S0171">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0060">that looks like that's going to be really good</u>
<u n="87" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0060">Ridley Scott <pause dur="short"/> em <pause dur="short"/> very Alien <pause dur="short"/> I think although I I don't know for definite but it looks like it's asked around the alien space craft or the aliens that have the spacecraft where they find the alien first of all</u>
<u n="89" who="S0086">oh okay</u>
<u n="90" who="S0060">do you remember the one that is kind of looks like an elephant? Kind of you probably can't remember</u>
<u n="91" who="S0086">oh right no</u>
<u n="92" who="S0060">they find the massive there's a huge big alien in the spaceship where they find the alien eggs in the very first film</u>

<u n="97" who="S0060">yeah where he eh on the breakfast table isn't it? Yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0086">that's <pause dur="short"/> my mum watched that when she was eight and a half months pregnant with me <pause dur="short"/> I was her first born <pause dur="short"/> she watched that and she was like holy cow <pause dur="short"/> oh my god  Oh my god  I've got a life coming out of me in a matter of weeks</u>
<u n="99" who="S0060">well it looks <pause dur="short"/> it's gone back to that sort of dark sort of thing with that <pause dur="short"/> so it's really cool <pause dur="short"/> that should be good</u>
<u n="100" who="S0086">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's interesting <pause dur="short"/> he's made yeah <pause dur="short"/> sort of hit and miss films for me <pause dur="short"/> some of them are really good and some been just a bit cheesy</u>
<u n="101" who="S0060">he's made his name of the back of that hasn't he?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0086">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I like Gladiator</u>

<u n="105" who="S0060">no no no no <pause dur="short"/> there was talk of Gladiator Two effectively <pause dur="short"/> but I never saw anything more of it <pause dur="short"/> cos it you know any film that's really successful like that they're going to make a sequel aren't they <pause dur="short"/> like <pause dur="short"/> well no I don't know cos it wasn't a successful film <pause dur="short"/> like Wrath of the Titans after Clash of the Titans</u>
<u n="106" who="S0171">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0060">Cos you want to go and see that don't you?</u>

<u n="112" who="S0060">well actually it's all sold on him being a good looking guy</u>
<u n="113" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0171">the other one it's em obviously come out very well is eh is it Taylor Lautner <pause dur="short"/> from the Twilight series</u>
<u n="115" who="S0086">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> he's done a lot of films on the back of that though hasn't he?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0060" trans="overlap">yeah it</u>
<u n="117" who="S0171">mm <pause dur="short"/> loads</u>

<u n="124" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0060">yeah you're thinking of the other one</u>
<u n="126" who="S0171">oh yeah I'm thinking yeah I'm thinking <pause dur="short"/> yeah was thinking <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> wasn't I? Rather than <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="127" who="S0060">loads of stuff <pause dur="short"/> but I don't <pause dur="short"/> I don't think the stuff at the cinema or the films that have come out in the last sort of while have been all that good</u>
<u n="128" who="S0086">no <pause dur="short"/> I haven't been to see any blockbusters for a while <pause dur="short"/> had a very cultural evening with my mum on Thursday we went to the ballet</u>
<u n="129" who="S0060">oh</u>
<u n="130" who="S0171">mm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0086">madame <pause dur="short"/> yeah well she said I want to go to the ballet therefore you have to get me tickets and you must come <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="132" who="S0171">you have no choice</u>
<u n="133" who="S0086">and birthday girl prerogative you just have to do it <pause dur="short"/> but actually it was really good <pause dur="short"/> it was you know the Arts Picture House they televise you know plays or ballet and the show it to you <pause dur="short"/> so rather than spend forty quid one the ballet which you probably won't enjoy you spend ten pounds and you get to drink during it so that's fine</u>
<u n="134" who="S0060">oh that's good</u>
<u n="135" who="S0086">so we did that but actually I was really surprised I really enjoyed it <pause dur="short"/> I don't know whether it's just because it was Romeo and Juliet so I knew the story <pause dur="short"/> I didn't have to try and work out what the hell was going on</u>
<u n="136" who="S0060">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0171">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0086">em so you know and it was very it was really beautiful <pause dur="short"/> by the end everyone was like mm <pause dur="short"/> and they finished dancing and then the curtain came down and the two leads came out and they were clinging on to each other cos it had been such an emotional experience <pause dur="short"/> and it is really definitely you <pause dur="short"/> but I haven't done any cultural things for ages so it was nice actually</u>
<u n="139" who="S0060">oh right <pause dur="short"/> I can always remember when I was doing the doing my GCSEs and that doing English literature and we used to go down to the eh to the theatre and to opera supposedly to broaden our eh</u>
<u n="140" who="S0086">expand your mind</u>
<u n="141" who="S0060">horizons <pause dur="short"/> it was very much like that with opera <pause dur="short"/> mostly Italian opera as well where you had if you didn't know what the blooming thing was about in the first place you didn't know what was going on</u>
<u n="142" who="S0086">yeah you're screwed and it lasts for four hours</u>
<u n="143" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> I can remember going <pause dur="short"/> we went all the way over the Stratford to the  to the  theatre there and what was it we watched? It was Taming of the Shrew or something like that <pause dur="short"/> but the blooming <pause dur="short"/> to get all the way over there for the  for the  showing and blooming the drive back it blooming it was blooming evening <pause dur="short"/> it was so late by the time we got back I was like bloody hell we're not going to do this regularly</u>
<u n="144" who="S0086">did you enjoy it?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0060">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it was very good <pause dur="short"/> but he</u>
<u n="146" who="S0086">yeah there's something about seeing live theatre actually isn't there?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos that was <pause dur="short"/> ah who was doing it?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0086">RSC maybe? If it was Stratford?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0060">no I'm trying to think who was in it <pause dur="short"/> I think it was em what's her name? Did the Darling Buds of May</u>
<u n="150" who="S0171">I haven't got a clue</u>
<u n="151" who="S0060">what's her name? Was in Entrapment</u>
<u n="152" who="S0171">oh Catherine Zeta-Jones</u>
<u n="153" who="S0060">Catherine Zeta-Jones <pause dur="short"/> I think it was her <pause dur="short"/> I think she was the shrew I think</u>
<u n="154" who="S0086">mm that's interesting <pause dur="short"/> I would never think of her as a stage actress</u>
<u n="155" who="S0060">I'm pretty sure it was her</u>
<u n="156" who="S0171">I suppose you've got to start somewhere</u>
<u n="157" who="S0060">it was a long time ago though so my memory may have totally failed me</u>
<u n="158" who="S0171">it must have been before <pause dur="short"/> it must have been before her acting career then</u>
<u n="159" who="S0060">no</u>
<u n="160" who="S0086">the thing is I think it takes a lot more to do stage doesn't it? Cos you've only got one chance to do it <pause dur="short"/> whereas if you're used to doing a lot of TV then eh</u>
<u n="161" who="S0060">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> everything that's on the telly and you know cinema and that it's all about you know <pause dur="short"/> it's all perfect lighting perfect sound edited dubbed <pause dur="short"/> you know tweaked to be perfect</u>
<u n="162" who="S0086">yeah you can do as many takes as you need to</u>

<u n="329" who="S0171"><anon type="place"/> yeah</u>
<u n="330" who="S0060">but <anon type="place"/> I suppose really</u>
<u n="331" who="S0171">but every time we go down there we always end up driving past it and have to come turn around and come back again</u>

<u n="345" who="S0086">it sounds nice <pause dur="short"/> I've been thinking about moving out of the city just cos it's so expensive <pause dur="short"/> you know even just to rent cos I can't afford to buy</u>
<u n="346" who="S0060">well I mean here renting</u>
<u n="347" who="S0171">we got a deal on this place</u>

<u n="351" who="S0171">no it was not their stupid they were nice</u>
<u n="352" who="S0060">we we gained  we gained  from it <pause dur="short"/> this place is less than we were paying for a two bedroom flat in town</u>
<u n="353" who="S0086">and you've got a three bedroom house</u>
<u n="354" who="S0060">yeah</u>
<u n="355" who="S0086">nice</u>

<u n="357" who="S0086">A hundred quid less a month</u>
<u n="358" who="S0060">yeah</u>
<u n="359" who="S0086">Jesus</u>
<u n="360" who="S0171">yeah it was</u>
<u n="361" who="S0086">but you can't cycle from here can you? Into town</u>
<u n="362" who="S0060">you've tried it haven't you?</u>
<u n="363" who="S0171">not oh god no</u>
<u n="364" who="S0086">you nearly died</u>
<u n="365" who="S0171">that's hilarious <pause dur="short"/> that's fucking hilarious <pause dur="short"/> no when we <pause dur="short"/> I cos we'd left the bike at the flat my bike at the flat <pause dur="short"/> and I said to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> oh no it'll be alright I'll just cycle it that's fine <pause dur="short"/> I'll cycle it <pause dur="short"/> and yeah it took me about three hours</u>
<u n="366" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="367" who="S0171">and I'd gone up through <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> and come out that way</u>
<u n="368" who="S0060">Cos the the only way</u>
<u n="369" who="S0171">and when you come out on to the main road at <anon type="place"/> between that connect to <anon type="place"/> and you know the other end the other side <pause dur="short"/> it's you're this close to fucking great big lorries</u>
<u n="370" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so unless you want to try</u>
<u n="371" who="S0086">yeah that's the thing</u>
<u n="372" who="S0060">unless you want to ride on the A14 <pause dur="short"/> you've got to like go out and round</u>
<u n="373" who="S0086">through the villages</u>
<u n="374" who="S0171">through the sticks yeah <pause dur="short"/> and that was fucking terrifying <pause dur="short"/> I had to walk the last bit</u>
<u n="375" who="S0060">but there's a there is  there is  a cycle path isn't there with with a little lit up cycle path but it doesn't come all the way round</u>
<u n="376" who="S0171">oh I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I ended up I think at the time I ended up using the the busway before the busway was actually built they'd just tarmacked it</u>
<u n="377" who="S0060">yeah you can use that yeah</u>
<u n="378" who="S0171">like they tarmacked it</u>
<u n="379" who="S0060">there's there is a cycle path that goes out I think it goes out somewhere near <anon type="place"/> but it then doesn't carry on round <pause dur="short"/> so you're then on just tiny little roads to come round the top side in from em <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="380" who="S0171">yeah I was <unclear/> bike <pause dur="short"/> I ended up walking cos I couldn't <pause dur="short"/> cos you can't cycle on the on the  road you can't <pause dur="short"/> it's just not possible <pause dur="short"/> so the only thing you've got left to choose is grass and unfortunately the grass was not helpful <pause dur="short"/> but eh</u>
<u n="381" who="S0086">yeah I think <pause dur="short"/> because you know cycling obviously quite popular I the city there's lots of websites that tell you all the cycle routes in and around the city <pause dur="short"/> so I think what I'll probably try and do is look at that map and then try and find somewhere that I can do that</u>
<u n="382" who="S0060">the best thing to do is to go to you know where</u>
<u n="383" who="S0086">no <pause dur="short"/> my geography is shit</u>
<u n="384" who="S0060">I was just going to name a pub in town actually <pause dur="short"/> so you're you're bound to know that</u>
<u n="385" who="S0086">oh yeah well I night know that</u>
<u n="386" who="S0060">em <pause dur="short"/> it's what's it called <pause dur="short"/> it changed name to I can't remember what</u>
<u n="387" who="S0171">yeah he's just about to name a pub that he can't remember what the name of the pub is</u>
<u n="388" who="S0086">and it's also changed names</u>
<u n="389" who="S0060">yeah</u>
<u n="390" who="S0171">yeah</u>
<u n="391" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's the one in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> on the riverside</u>
<u n="392" who="S0086">well that's where I live <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> but all of those are closed</u>
<u n="393" who="S0060">so what's the pub <pause dur="short"/>?</u>
<u n="394" who="S0086">the <anon type="place"/> is probably what you mean <pause dur="short"/> cos that changed names <pause dur="short"/> the <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="395" who="S0060"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="396" who="S0086">yeah that's closed</u>
<u n="397" who="S0060">is it really?</u>
<u n="398" who="S0086">yeah <pause dur="short"/> all of the pubs apart from the <anon type="place"/> have closed in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="399" who="S0060">oh no</u>
<u n="400" who="S0086">all of the locals blame it on the gypsies <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure we can blame everything on the gypsies <pause dur="short"/> much as everyone would like to <pause dur="short"/> the <anon type="place"/> has closed down <pause dur="short"/> the <anon type="place"/> has closed down <pause dur="short"/> there was one on the high street apparently before my time was closed It's all boarded up <pause dur="short"/> just before you get down to <anon type="place"/> high street Tesco's it's just before there <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so why would I have gone there?</u>
<u n="401" who="S0060">not because it's a pub but from there there's a cycle path that goes out all the way out to</u>
<u n="402" who="S0086">goes past <anon type="place"/> doesn't it on the right?</u>
<u n="403" who="S0060">yeah but what's the? What's where the train station is?</u>
<u n="404" who="S0086"><anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="405" who="S0060"><anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> and then it carries on <pause dur="short"/> well it doesn't carry on but then you carry on up there <pause dur="short"/> I know that's there because I built it</u>
<u n="406" who="S0086">ah nice</u>
<u n="407" who="S0060">so I know there's a few guys a couple of guys who actually work for the council that live there and cycle in all the way down into <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="408" who="S0086">really from <trunc>Wa</trunc> from <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="409" who="S0060">yeah</u>
<u n="410" who="S0086"><anon type="place"/> is really nice <pause dur="short"/> I don't think yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's probably cheaper than <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> but there's it's got a couple of nice pubs</u>
<u n="411" who="S0060">really?</u>
<u n="412" who="S0086">iIt would have been nice mum used to live in the black house on the river which is also known as the X files house apparently <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="413" who="S0060">alright</u>
<u n="414" who="S0086">em <pause dur="short"/> and from there you just have to walk around the river and round that bend you've got to the <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> so it would have been really nice to have a little bridge over there cos the only other bridge is the one by the <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> so you've got to walk and if you walk on that other side it's all fields is like a <unclear/> common <pause dur="short"/> but yeah I could do that <pause dur="short"/> definitely look into doing that <pause dur="short"/> cos if you lived in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> I mean that would be fine</u>
<u n="415" who="S0060">there's loads of places out here up for rent now</u>
<u n="416" who="S0086">I know it's just  it's just  the em having to rely on the bus</u>
<u n="417" who="S0060">well it's not that bad <pause dur="short"/> but you've got a car now</u>
<u n="418" who="S0086">it's my dad's car <pause dur="short"/> I mean I basically have a car</u>
<u n="419" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="420" who="S0086">but it's my dad's car <pause dur="short"/> if I <pause dur="short"/> the only reason I can use it so much is that</u>
<u n="421" who="S0060">you'll probably find out that the money you could save you'd probably be able to run a car anyway</u>
<u n="422" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0060">Cos it made a <pause dur="short"/> well it's made a big <trunc>di</trunc> I mean we're on a different tax bracket out here <pause dur="short"/> so we pay less tax</u>
<u n="424" who="S0086">really?</u>
<u n="425" who="S0060">yeah less council tax</u>
<u n="426" who="S0086">how's that? Oh council tax yeah</u>
<u n="427" who="S0060">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> em less council tax <pause dur="short"/> I'll be honest and say the bills are actually a bit less as well despite it being a three bed that we're trying to heat and everything <pause dur="short"/> but the rent being that lower</u>
<u n="428" who="S0086">that's good</u>
<u n="429" who="S0060">I mean  I mean  the silly thing is as well for me for the car <pause dur="short"/> I'm usually driving south down to London most days <pause dur="short"/> but it actually takes me less time to get from here to London than it did from town to London <pause dur="short"/> you know it's <trunc>an</trunc> it's another I think it's about another fifteen minutes <pause dur="short"/> sorry another fifteen miles further than we were <pause dur="short"/> and it probably takes about fifteen minutes less</u>
<u n="430" who="S0086">nice</u>
<u n="431" who="S0060">to get down there <pause dur="short"/> and it makes a big difference <pause dur="short"/> it's surprising <pause dur="short"/> you know just doing the bit in and out of time <pause dur="short"/> cos we used to live em behind the cinema actually behind cinema</u>
<u n="432" who="S0086">I <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah yeah</u>

<u n="440" who="S0086"><anon type="place"/> is not a cheap as I thought it was going to be like</u>
<u n="441" who="S0060">no cos it's all new <pause dur="short"/> or the new bit out to the north is ordinary obviously but the original bit n the middle <pause dur="short"/> but that's all old people so you know you've got to wait for them to die</u>

<u n="463" who="S0171">expensive widget and awkward as well</u>
<u n="464" who="S0086">I really wanted the iPhone but when I cancelled cos I me <pause dur="short"/> I was on one of these pay monthly sim only things <pause dur="short"/> my phone was literally disintegrating <pause dur="short"/> it was prehistoric <pause dur="short"/> it looked like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> my first phone <pause dur="short"/> I mean <pause dur="short"/> so em <pause dur="short"/> but I was only paying ten pounds a month <pause dur="short"/> so I called Vodafone who I've been with for about seven years <pause dur="short"/> it was a massive saga I'll just cut it short <pause dur="short"/> and they managed to get me to sign up for this the Samsung Galaxy S one lovely really good <pause dur="short"/> and I said well I was thinking about the iPhone and they said well actually the the Samsung is better rated on their on our website <pause dur="short"/> and did a bit of research and actually it is like a lot of their apps you get on the iPhone you have to pay for and they're free for other phones and it's better coverage and this that and the other and I was like okay fine <pause dur="short"/> so I signed for it so it's now twenty-six pounds a month but that's with internet and stuff and it is and it's a phone that works <pause dur="short"/> whereas the other phone was a bit of the lottery <pause dur="short"/> some calls it would allow <pause dur="short"/> some texts it would allow <pause dur="short"/> it was  it was  it kept me on my toes it was funny</u>
<u n="465" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> the unpredictability kept you excited</u>
<u n="466" who="S0086">yeah it was really exciting yeah <pause dur="short"/> so then that arrived the next day all lovely <pause dur="short"/> downloaded loads of exciting stuff <pause dur="short"/> was like playing with all the apps <pause dur="short"/> cos my last phone didn't have any of this <pause dur="short"/> I was like the internet? What? On my phone? Oh my god <pause dur="short"/> I'm living in the twenty-first century <pause dur="short"/> turns out I could probably communicate with aliens on my new phone <pause dur="short"/> couldn't call anyone on my phone though</u>
<u n="467" who="S0060">really?</u>
<u n="468" who="S0086">when I called someone it was fine on my end but there was a really bad echo on theirs <pause dur="short"/> the would just hear themselves back <pause dur="short"/> mum went mental she was like it's so bad <pause dur="short"/> I was like call Vodafone <pause dur="short"/> oh we're really sorry you've called within the one week we'll send a new one out tomorrow <pause dur="short"/> nothing arrived <pause dur="short"/> so a week went by so I said well nothing's arrived <pause dur="short"/> oh well it's not in stock at the warehouse <pause dur="short"/> fine thanks for letting me know that's really <unclear/> Could you send one out tomorrow? Eh not tomorrow but we'll get one out to you by the end of the week <pause dur="short"/> thank you <pause dur="short"/> didn't send it to my work address as I requested they sent it to my mum's address <pause dur="short"/> no one was there to sign of it so they took it away again <pause dur="short"/> had to call them again <pause dur="short"/> oh yes madam we'll come out tomorrow with a new phone really sorry about that <pause dur="short"/> they never turn up <pause dur="short"/> they didn't turn up anywhere <pause dur="short"/> call them again well actually why don't you send your phone back to us <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> send me a parcel a like a bag to put it in</u>
<u n="469" who="S0060">yeah and I'll send it to you</u>
<u n="470" who="S0086">and I said ah that never arrived <pause dur="short"/> my phone wasn't in the post room because had my phone and they arrived out of hours so missed them had to call again <pause dur="short"/> so this is about the sixth time I've tried to arrange or them to collect the phone <pause dur="short"/> by this time I'm furious <pause dur="short"/> so they finally come and collect the old one I've not got the the one that works <pause dur="short"/> but it just took me ages to get hold of someone who I could actually complain to <pause dur="short"/> cos first of all they said oh there's no one here <pause dur="short"/> we'll have to escalate the call to someone they'll call you back <pause dur="short"/> they never called back <pause dur="short"/> next person oh no you've got to log a complaint on the website <pause dur="short"/> and I said is it one of those emails that goes into ether and no one responds <pause dur="short"/> oh no madam we always respond <pause dur="short"/> so then I finally got someone to call me back and he said I'm very sorry <pause dur="short"/> and I said well actually the service that you get when you call Vodafone everyone is very apologetic <pause dur="short"/> oh I'm very sorry madam they've absolutely got that in hand and then it never turns up <pause dur="short"/> and you think well what you're saying is great but it never actually materialises <pause dur="short"/> I'm very sorry madam there's obviously communication problems there could we offer you <unclear/> Well the money isn't you know going to cover this the pain that you've suffered but you know can we offer you some money <pause dur="short"/> well actually yes that would be very nice thank you</u>

<u n="473" who="S0060">well the thing I always say about this you know <pause dur="short"/> my paying for calls and my paying for this is paying your wages <pause dur="short"/> you know it's not I'm not doing you a favour you're meant to be sorting it out for me</u>
<u n="474" who="S0086">absolutely yeah</u>
<u n="475" who="S0060">yeah we've transferred over to Virgin now for our phone and broadband and everything</u>
<u n="476" who="S0086">oh yeah</u>
<u n="477" who="S0060">and I'll be honest and say that while occasionally it ends up grinding to a halt and just being silly it's ten times better normally than BT ever was</u>
<u n="478" who="S0086">really?</u>
<u n="479" who="S0060">and eh yeah customer service is a little bit hit and miss whereas BT you might as well not have bothered phoning them <pause dur="short"/> em but eh but no we had em <pause dur="short"/> what day was it last week darling? Was it at the weekend or?</u>
<u n="480" who="S0171">eh I think it was Wednesday actually</u>

<u n="492" who="S0171">no what it was darling was there was an automated voicemail that they left on the phone</u>
<u n="493" who="S0060">yeah the voicemail thing</u>
<u n="494" who="S0171">saying <pause dur="short"/> we have tried to fix your area <pause dur="short"/> if you still need an engineer <unclear/></u>
<u n="495" who="S0060">the way  The way  they figure out as to whether there's a network error is if once it gets passed a threshold number of complaints</u>
<u n="496" who="S0086">oh right  <pause dur="short"/> encouraging</u>
<u n="497" who="S0060">and then it's there's a problem with the network and they have to send someone out to look at the network</u>
<u n="498" who="S0086">okay</u>
<u n="499" who="S0060">so obviously ours was one of the first calls rather them one of the later ones where they could have just said yeah it's a network problem it will come back on when it comes back on sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> but eh yeah</u>
<u n="500" who="S0086">how long were you without it?</u>

<u n="891" who="S0086">what did you have? What happened?</u>
<u n="892" who="S0171">it was disgusting <pause dur="short"/> I think I decided to cook <pause dur="short"/> I've not had fish fingers since <pause dur="short"/> but I don't know what the hell happened <pause dur="short"/> but we'd cooked them and we then tucked in <pause dur="short"/> I just had a mouthful of one and it's I don't even know it must have been off</u>
<u n="893" who="S0060">they were em</u>
<u n="894" who="S0171">yeah probably rotten more than off</u>
<u n="895" who="S0060">no no no <pause dur="short"/> well they were</u>
<u n="896" who="S0171">you ate them I don't know why?</u>
<u n="897" who="S0060">Cos I'm double hard</u>
<u n="898" who="S0171">obviously got the stomach for it</u>
<u n="899" who="S0060">what it was is they we had no food in so we thought well we'll defrost something from the freezer and we had these fish fingers in there <pause dur="short"/> but I think they'd been in there quite some time <pause dur="short"/> and when they came out they weren't we'd cooked them cos they didn't you know they don't look any different when they're frozen and eh they were just a little bit dodgy</u>
<u n="900" who="S0086">aw <pause dur="short"/> did they smell?</u>
<u n="901" who="S0060">eh they didn't smell but they did taste a bit weird</u>
<u n="902" who="S0171">they tasted disgusting</u>

<u n="906" who="S0086">game over <pause dur="short"/> aw</u>
<u n="907" who="S0171">yeah the thing is that is really annoying that really annoys me with him is that <trunc>fr</trunc> now since then at every opportunity I'll say to him have you checked that?

Even chicken  Even chicken  that we buy precooked from like Waitrose if it smells funny or if it's a bit watery I'll run it under his nose is that alright?  is that alright?  He'll be like yeah it's fine just eat</u>
<u n="908" who="S0086">it's really difficult with frozen foods though because obviously you don't know quite how long it's been there so all the dates are wrong <pause dur="short"/> so it could have been in there six months but it's frozen so it's okay but it might have been in there a year in which case chuck it</u>
<u n="909" who="S0060">no I I find quite often things like fish don't last very well in the freezer</u>
<u n="910" who="S0086">my fish fingers don't have the chance to last till they go off <pause dur="short"/> I'd cook a really good chilli the other day actually</u>

<u n="1053" who="S0086">that's really good though cos for me to get a cab from where I am on <anon type="place"/> costs about eight nine pounds</u>
<u n="1054" who="S0171">God <pause dur="short"/> I think the last time I caught a taxi though he actually charged me less <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if he's just being nice or if he's  or if he's  cos he <trunc>do</trunc> charged me twelve <pause dur="short"/> by the time we got in</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0060">yeah I <trunc>r</trunc>I was just saying twelve cos I thought that was what you paid last time</u>
<u n="1056" who="S0171">yeah it was the last time yeah</u>
<u n="1057" who="S0060">but eh where I was at at <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> that used to be like twenty-two pound or something like that</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0086">jeez</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and that that was back in the days when we used to go into town a lot more often</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0171">yes those were the days <pause dur="short"/> I cannot anymore park <pause dur="short"/> eh</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0086">we're grownups now</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0171">yeah we're grownups now <pause dur="short"/> we don't get  any more <pause dur="short"/> but eh but no I remember cos with taxis it depends on where they go <pause dur="short"/> and most of the time I mean obviously they're allowed to use the the bus ways you know the bus barriers they can get through them <pause dur="short"/> and I think that's probably what he did differently <pause dur="short"/> was when he come out of town</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0060">oh so he took the short cut</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0171">he went  he went  a slightly different way <pause dur="short"/> and although the other  the other  taxi took me <pause dur="short"/> you know the the road that runs between Lloyds and <trunc>TS</trunc> eh Lloyds and Boots</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0060">yeah I know where you mean</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0171">he was taking me through that way <pause dur="short"/> whereas the last taxi had taken me straight through via the bus route</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0060">well I always used to think that em going out in <anon type="place"/> was cos we were you know once you go across the A fourteen it becomes more expensive <pause dur="short"/> if you cross and go outside of the town sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> but eh</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0086">Taxis man <pause dur="short"/> they're a joke <pause dur="short"/> I mean when and when it snowed you know six weeks ago or whatever it was <pause dur="short"/> my friend lives in <anon type="place"/> but she was in the city <pause dur="short"/> we were going to meet on the Saturday night but she was with her fella during the day <pause dur="short"/> I think I was home waiting to hear from her and then the snow started it started on Saturday night didn't it?</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0060">yeah</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0086">early evening <pause dur="short"/> and I thought ah I'll just wait for her to text me but I won't come and meet I'll get her to some here just get a cab <pause dur="short"/> and then it started snowing quite heavily and I hadn't heard from her so I gave her a ring it was about seven o'clock and I said where are you? She said oh we're in the pub we're just we had dinner and we got carried away <pause dur="short"/> sorry where are you <pause dur="short"/> and I as like oh I'm at home it's snowing <pause dur="short"/> she's like what? She got out of the pub and she was like holy moley I had no idea it was going to snow <pause dur="short"/> and I was like are you being serious <pause dur="short"/> she said no I didn't check the weather forecast <pause dur="short"/> like how are you going to get home? She's like yeah <trunc>ho</trunc> how how am I going to get home? mm <pause dur="short"/> I may as well look at the buses and then I'll call you back <pause dur="short"/> walked to the bus station on <anon type="place"/> no buses <pause dur="short"/> no signs no nothing <pause dur="short"/> and I said just get a cab home and we'll meet another time <pause dur="short"/> and the cabs weren't going <pause dur="short"/> they wouldn't even leave the city <pause dur="short"/> and so she got a cab to mine <pause dur="short"/> next morning managed to get a cab but not until later in the day cos if all that snow <pause dur="short"/> panther charged her <pause dur="short"/> I think they wanted to charge her and extra ten pounds going between because it's instead of going from to go from my house rather than from town <pause dur="short"/> even though normally it would cost about <trunc>s</trunc> like seven or eight pounds to get from mine to town <pause dur="short"/> wanted to charge her an extra ten pound <pause dur="short"/> so the cab home to Haverhill cost thirty-five quid</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0060">no</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0086">yeah <pause dur="short"/> taxis in <anon type="place"/> are a joke <pause dur="short"/> so expensive <pause dur="short"/> the meter starts at like four pounds doesn't it? So bad</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0060">no that that Saturday you are talking about we were out and about <pause dur="short"/> and we'd come back and there'd be no sign of anything we were home and we were going out on the Sunday <pause dur="short"/> and we got up the next morning and it was like <pause dur="short"/> what on earth's happened here kind of things</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0086">mm <pause dur="short"/> there was loads of it wasn't there?</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0060">em well we'd got we we it was fine for us coming out on the Sunday <pause dur="short"/> and we drove out down <pause dur="short"/> and literally all round the loop road there was cars parked up on the verges where they'd obviously the the main road had been eh cleared but no one could actually get in to their road o they just pared there and walked <pause dur="short"/> so there was just a long line of cars all the way round and we're like this is weird <pause dur="short"/> so we drove out round isn't it? Do you remember that?</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0171">what's that?</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0086">the abandoned cars</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0060">all the cars that were parked along round the <unclear/> road in the snow</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0171">ah god yeah <pause dur="short"/> well you know the last time it snowed <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't really a lot was it?</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0060">no no</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0171">not really</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0086">it was more flowy</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0171">well there was em abandoned cars up on the top of the hill again</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0060">yeah?</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0171">there was hardly nothing <pause dur="short"/> hardly a bit of snow and they go in and <pause dur="short"/> ah bugger it and just abandon their cars</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0060">yeah but unfortunately these days any bit of snow is just used as an excuse now ah it's snowing I can't get to work <pause dur="short"/> I can't do this can't do that <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean I remember last last January the year before last rather <pause dur="short"/> yeah year and bit <pause dur="short"/> and eh I was I had to go for eh <pause dur="short"/> we had we have our monthly like commercial reviews at <unclear/> the regional office <pause dur="short"/> and for me I normally I would leave at five and would <trunc>h</trunc>get there for seven so I can miss all the traffic on the M25 and eh I'd left and it was when I mean all the real bad snow <pause dur="short"/> and I left at five and I got there at eight <pause dur="short"/> l and I sat outside cos waiting for someone to turn up to open it up and everything <pause dur="short"/> and it got to half past ten and no one had turned up <pause dur="short"/> so I just want oh bugger that I'm going to go <pause dur="short"/> and it took me it only took me two hours to get home because obviously by half past ten all the people that were going to try had tried and just it was done <pause dur="short"/> no one else was travelling <pause dur="short"/> so it was clear <pause dur="short"/> em but I mean there were people that were that lived almost in walking distance of the office and they just hadn't even bothered to come in <pause dur="short"/> I'm like I've driven a hundred miles and I've got there <pause dur="short"/> where is everybody else? You know people that were really close to the office and didn't even bother to try and go in <pause dur="short"/> you know really peed me off <pause dur="short"/> but eh I mean I can remember when eh good few years ago <pause dur="short"/> when was that? Nine years ago now? Yeah will have been nine years ago when the M eleven ended up in shit because of the snow and they hadn't gritted anything <pause dur="short"/> and I was working at Harlow at the time but living out on the M four <pause dur="short"/> and eh I'd left and it was I'd left at sort of basically said oh we need to get gone otherwise we're going to get stuck <pause dur="short"/> and I'd left at three o'clock or four o'clock something like that <pause dur="short"/> I'd come out onto the M11 going south and there was nobody <pause dur="short"/> I mean there was snow everywhere but it was like where is everybody? What's going on? And it was cos it was closed further up where it had just been totally whited out <pause dur="short"/> and it was so bad that people were stuck in their cars like over like twenty-four hours <pause dur="short"/> and they were in their cars and they were running out of fuel where they would have it left of tick over to keep warm and things like that <pause dur="short"/> and it was like days before all of them were eh clear <pause dur="short"/> but I mean thankfully I was sort of ahead of the storm so to speak so I got home and everything fine but <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> they've never it's never been well they've they've always been more prepared for it now <pause dur="short"/> but then they'd done absolutely nothing before the snow <pause dur="short"/> they knew it was coming but they'd done nothing cos they didn't think it was really going to be as bad <pause dur="short"/> and like suddenly the whole of the M eleven was totally out of it <pause dur="short"/> totally gone</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0171">well that's what they did this year didn't they? After last years <pause dur="short"/> they ended up stocking up on extra salt and extra grit and then they've not not really used it now cos it's not been that bad</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0060">well they haven't needed to but <pause dur="short"/> the whole thing is everyone every year moans saying oh well how can you know place like Norway and Sweden and all this cope and it's cos they have a lot more often a lot more regularly <pause dur="short"/> so they pay to have stuff in place <pause dur="short"/> well we can all pay more taxes and have snow ploughs and grit and all this sat there doing nothing for eleven months of the year and maybe do something for a month maybe</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0086">absolutely yeah</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0060">and eh</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0171">well it's not even month though is it?</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0060">well no it's not <pause dur="short"/> few weeks if that</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0171">it doesn't last a month</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0060">and it's like well <pause dur="short"/> you know people aren't going to do it <pause dur="short"/> they'll moan and gripe about it but if you actually said them okay well</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0086">give us some more money then</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0060">okay an extra hundred pound a month in tax and we'll have it all sorted for you everybody would be up in arms <pause dur="short"/> oh well don't need it rah</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0086">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> be interesting to find out what they do about the privatisation of the roads <pause dur="short"/> they were talking about that last week</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0060">yeah that's interesting <pause dur="short"/> yeah they've <trunc>be</trunc> they've been saying well no no existing roads will be made into toll roads</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0086">yeah loads of new roads</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0060">so so there's going to be a lot of new roads go up <pause dur="short"/> to say there you go use this</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0171">more work for you then darling</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0060">well it will be <pause dur="short"/> I mean that's it all started with the M six toll which we built <pause dur="short"/> you know that was one of the first eh Dartford crossing obviously is a toll <pause dur="short"/> but the Dartford crossing is the one I still curse them because when that was built it was that it would only operate as a toll until it paid off the bills</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0171">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0060">em but they obviously realised they were going to make too much money out of it so it's it's operated as a toll ever since <pause dur="short"/> cos they long long ago paid off the bills</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0086">paid off the builders yeah <pause dur="short"/> well they're saying the the if they do expand the A14 it will be paid for the tolls <pause dur="short"/> do you think that's what's going to happen?</u>
<u n="1106" who="S0060">they've had one the book plans for doing it for so long but there's always been so much protest over what would have to be done cos it goes through so many middle of the nothing places and eh it's been put back and put back and put back and put back <pause dur="short"/> you know but I mean the there's some very basic stuff that they could do which would make it so much better <pause dur="short"/> you know getting rid of all of these at grey junctions so like Catthorpe Interchange and all of those junctions where you're coming down everything's coming down to nothing <pause dur="short"/> and then winds through a tiny little bit and then go again <pause dur="short"/> you know get rid of them and make them grade separated junctions where the A fourteen carries on and it's just people then come off <pause dur="short"/> and it would make it a lot easier <pause dur="short"/> but eh <pause dur="short"/> but yeah I think they're going to have to get a lot more money just to overcome all the the protest and wooha there is in the different areas and yeah probably the only way to do that is to to say oh yeah we're going to have it operated and maintained by a company that's going to fund it <pause dur="short"/> you know so I wouldn't be surprised if you know probably some of my lot end up coming up with something of how they could do it fund it and operate it <pause dur="short"/> you know PFIs are a lot of the things these days so <pause dur="short"/> just having a taste see if it was poisoned</u>
<u n="1107" who="S0171">if it was poisoned I think the pair of us would be in a lot of trouble</u>
<u n="1108" who="S0060">we might have keeled over <pause dur="short"/> be interesting to see if they do anything to A ten <pause dur="short"/> on the way to Norwich <pause dur="short"/> cos that roads <trunc>pre</trunc> pretty em pretty slow isn't it? If you get stuck behind a tractor you're screwed</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0060">well they were going to build this new town weren't they? Em <pause dur="short"/> somewhere</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0171">Don't we go down the A ten to go down to Reading?</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0060">no the A one</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0171">oh</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0060">the A ten does go all the way down there <pause dur="short"/> just between what's the next bridge up can't remember what it is on the A10</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0171"><anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0060">no no you're going the other way</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0086">you're going south</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0060">North</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0086">em <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember what it was now but there was plans to do that</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0086">Ely is the A ten isn't it?</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0060">sorry?</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0086">Ely is on the A ten isn't it?</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0060">Ely yeah but not that far up <pause dur="short"/> em and there was a load of hooha saying well you know you've got all these plans for building it <pause dur="short"/> it was like ten or twenty thousand new houses they were going to build <pause dur="short"/> and it was like there was all these plans for building and this but you've not got any plans to improve the A ten <pause dur="short"/> so where are all these people going to go? They're going to commute down to Cambridge or they're going to come to Cambridge to get on the train to go into London <pause dur="short"/> you know where are they all going to come? They're going to come down on the twenty ten twenty miles of the A10 <pause dur="short"/> which already is pretty chock-a-block every day <pause dur="short"/> em but yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean they were talking I don't know whether it's going to happen <pause dur="short"/> of building a new train station to the south of Cambridge to act as a commuter station <pause dur="short"/> so instead of everyone having to come into Cambridge to get a <trunc>bu</trunc> eh to get a train rather it would go there and and get a commuter line down but <pause dur="short"/> I've not heard any more about that <pause dur="short"/> but eh</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0086">I think they should do that with the students <pause dur="short"/> you know they're building loads of em new flats and houses in the C B one quarter <pause dur="short"/> they're building them for students <pause dur="short"/> well students can fuck off quite frankly <pause dur="short"/> put them in a little village with a bus a couple of times a day <pause dur="short"/> and you know</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0060"><anon type="place"/> <anon type="place"/> there's loads of what do they call it? I can't <pause dur="short"/> there's some name which basically means cheap and nasty but it's not</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0086">housing association?</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0060">no cos they don't <pause dur="short"/> nothing is called the housing association anymore</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0086">oh right</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0060">it was em a type of housing they call it now <pause dur="short"/> what's it <trunc>ca</trunc> what do they call it? Cos when we were there building the riverside bridge they were <trunc>do</trunc> there's a big housing development on the south side of the river isn't there <pause dur="short"/> and it was all about how certain ones of them were going to be priced as you know for getting a decent amount of money and there was other ones they were having to build as part of the planning permission <pause dur="short"/> and it was called this other thing and I can't remember</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0086">affordable housing?</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0060">no it wasn't  it wasn't  It was something <pause dur="short"/> I can't think what it was</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0086">welfare housing</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0060">but yeah it basically meant it <trunc>ma</trunc> it basically meant affordable <pause dur="short"/> but it wasn't it was a you know a bit of a phrase I can't remember what it was <pause dur="short"/> cos we were talking to them cos obviously why we while we were there working and everything <pause dur="short"/> and they were saying ah yeah you know because it <trunc>w</trunc> at the time I was sort of thinking oh maybe I could you know buy something here and that <pause dur="short"/> and but when we were talking to them it was like ah yeah you wouldn't want to look at any of these <pause dur="short"/> and I was like why is that oh well just you know <pause dur="short"/> the one's over there that were' going to be charging out at sort of three hundred grand cos they're going to have riverside frontage and this that and the other <pause dur="short"/> they use all the nice materials and all the cheap chit gets put into these ones over here <pause dur="short"/> and it's like really looks bad <pause dur="short"/> but eh but yeah</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0086">that's bad but that's how they get away with it <pause dur="short"/> cheeky <pause dur="short"/> they should be building houses with solar panels as well really shouldn't they?</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0060">did you read? There was a thing in the news <pause dur="short"/> some little old couple has been told they've got to remove twelve thousand pounds worth of solar panels that they put on their house cos they never got planning permission to do it and it doesn't fit in with the local</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0086">no way <pause dur="short"/> they won't you know postdate the planning permission? They won't agree to it?</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0060">said they wouldn't agree to it <pause dur="short"/> wouldn't ever wouldn't even agree to if they'd applied so they had to remove it</u>

<u n="1141" who="S0086">that's rubbish <pause dur="short"/> that's the sort of thing you see on Grand Designs isn't it?

<u n="1309" who="S0060">farm farming only takes you know only covers employment for a very small <pause dur="short"/> compared with the amount of land it takes up it's a very small employer isn't it? Of people</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0171">and then of course there's the people that rely on tourism <pause dur="short"/> like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> are the people that we stay with when we go up and they have their own B and B business <pause dur="short"/> and obviously they then therefore rely on the tourism that goes in up there <pause dur="short"/> which there is a lot of tourism up there that's I think that's got to be Orkney's main <pause dur="short"/> main income</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0060">yeah it must be hard in the winter months <pause dur="short"/> you'd have to make enough money in the summer to sort of tide you through <pause dur="short"/> I think what they do in the west say like in the winter months we go down to the seaside towns <pause dur="short"/> everything is boarded up</u>

<u n="1325" who="S0060">Skye is an island</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0086">so you get the train up somewhere the you have to go up to Skye by boat and then from there you have to go to Harris and then from Harris</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0060">that's why you call it the Isle of Skye</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0086">and then from Harris <pause dur="short"/> that's probably why they call it the Isle of Skye <pause dur="short"/> so it's about one train journey and then I think there's a train over a bridge to and island and then there's a boat from an island to an island and then there's another boat from an island to and island</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0171">oh god</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0086">and what you were saying about you know the next generation moving away <pause dur="short"/> that's what they do <pause dur="short"/> as soon as they get old enough they all move away <pause dur="short"/> so it's that sort of generation that's are like in their forties and fifties and all they do is they just go toe the pub and get absolutely shit faced <pause dur="short"/> so it's nice to go and visit it's relay really pretty it's really nice from what I've seen <pause dur="short"/> haven't been myself bit then I don't know how sustainable it is and what's going to happen to it once that generation dies</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0171">mm</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0086">Cos they haven't got anything there themselves they have to import everything</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0060">well it's like I was saying for me there'd be absolutely nothing for me to do work wise</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0171">no not even <unclear/></u>
<u n="1335" who="S0060">there's so  There's so  few people the building that goes on there is the very very bare minimum <pause dur="short"/> you know there's nothing happening</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0171">even the original roads that they built are still like new <pause dur="short"/> there's no pot holes there's no fading of white lines is there?</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean the roads have been there for you know year upon year upon year and it's almost as though they've only just gone down <pause dur="short"/> cos there's so few people driving on them <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> I mean there's what? Twenty thousand people? Something like that</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0171">I don't know how many <pause dur="short"/> I don't know but it's sort of its small</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0060">it's certainly declined from what it used to be <pause dur="short"/> it used to be more people back in eh <pause dur="short"/> well back a hundred years there used to be quite a lot of people but it em <pause dur="short"/> I think it started declining in sort of the eighties and sort of</u>

<u n="1341" who="S0060">getting away from her</u>
<u n="1342" who="S0171">I wouldn't be surprised by that</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0060">em no she was getting away from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s dad <pause dur="short"/> and although well I <pause dur="short"/> well I that's what I think she went up there for <pause dur="short"/> she tells me otherwise she tells it's because nana and granddad's accident <pause dur="short"/> em cos nan decided that she was going to em drive down to said main road that's rarely used at seventy miles an hour and then pass out</u>
<u n="1344" who="S0086">oh my god</u>
<u n="1345" who="S0171">yeah <pause dur="short"/> granddad was fully awake</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0060">sat in the car beside her</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0171">sat in the car next to her <pause dur="short"/> and eh thankfully</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0060">can you imagine <pause dur="short"/> driving on a road sixty mile and hour you <trunc>dr</trunc> you're a passage and the driver passes out on the</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0086">shit <pause dur="short"/> why did she pass out?</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0171">we don't know <pause dur="short"/> she em <pause dur="short"/> it's not a common occurrence for her but she's an old lady now she's you know got pushing on ninety I think now <pause dur="short"/> em <pause dur="short"/> and she'd thankfully probably would have done her more damage than anything else <pause dur="short"/> and consequently she's still like it but <pause dur="short"/> ooh excuse me <pause dur="short"/> thankfully she was driving long a particular part of the road that em has road field and then se <pause dur="short"/> em and thankfully she managed to when she did pass out em she thankfully managed to plough herself into one of the hay bales that was there in the field <pause dur="short"/> otherwise if she if that hay bail was not there she would have ended up in the sea</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0060">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh I knocked it off <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> thankfully rather than ending up in these they got stuck in a hay bail</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0171">granddad was absolutely bricking himself</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0086">God someone was watching down on them that day</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0171">mm <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> but no my my nan <pause dur="short"/> em <pause dur="short"/> even to the day she today she wears a neck brace and her head just crumples like that</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0086">really</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0171">em but em <pause dur="short"/> and she's got a real bad ass attitude as well but <pause dur="short"/> she em my nana and granddad are of that era <pause dur="short"/> same kind of era as <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s mum and dad in that once you're married that's it <pause dur="short"/> and em and they've been married for about fifty years now I think and he and my nan is a right old bitch <pause dur="short"/> she's really horrible</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0060">yeah unfortunately your nan where as a people get older or some of them anyway the the sort of wiring in their brain starts to decay a little bit and she's turned into</u>
<u n="1358" who="S0171">A monster</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0060">a horrible old harridan who absolutely torments your granddad</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0171">the one thing that she was doing was shortly after I moved up there and obviously shortly after they'd had this accident <pause dur="short"/> naturally my nan was talked she's not allowed to drive for obvious reasons but she did not like this <pause dur="short"/> and eh and it was down to my mum em because obviously she couldn't leave it to my granddad cos granddad is just pants for my nan <pause dur="short"/> em so she'd taken nan's car keys em and was keeping them to prevent her driving <pause dur="short"/> cracking idea <pause dur="short"/> and mum was <trunc>say</trunc> the amount of ties that my mum <pause dur="short"/> and she my mum never calls me I usually end up calling her <pause dur="short"/> and when I would call her she would be in <trunc>fl</trunc> in in tears and so really upset because my nan my nan would be slagging her off something chronic <pause dur="short"/> calling her all the names under the sun just to get her bloody car keys back</u>
<u n="1361" who="S0060">when we first went up there and eh</u>
<u n="1362" who="S0171">nan's always been civilised to us though hasn't she? She's been</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0060">yeah but even first time I'd met them and you hadn't seen them for years <pause dur="short"/> and your nan was well she wasn't red but she was very much</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0171">oh her own</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0060">couldn't couldn't care whether you were in the room or not kind of thing</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0086">God</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0060">and eh was couldn't get us out of the door fast enough relay could she?</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0171">no I mean <pause dur="short"/> another example of how nasty my nan is <pause dur="short"/> my granddad is losing sight in his eyes <pause dur="short"/> and em <pause dur="short"/> to the point where rather than kind of you know when you turn out of and old <trunc>fa</trunc> fashioned television and it does the the line and the dot in the middle <pause dur="short"/> it's a bit like that</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0060">yeah he's basically just got sort of his vision is down to like</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0171">A sliver</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0060">a little slither across his vision</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0086">ah bless</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0171">and it's getting worse and my nan treats him like a bloody dog</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0086">really?</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0171">and a slave yeah <pause dur="short"/> make cups of tea <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> I want a cup of tea please <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> where dinner <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0086">he has to make the dinner and he can't even see <pause dur="short"/> that must be dangerous <pause dur="short"/> poor granddad</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0171">yeah I mean my granddad</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0060">it's even worse cos he used to be em he used to be like a graphic designer so you know everything was with his eyes and he does well he still does but he used to be you know do a lot of photography and things like that so obviously a lot of what was his life is obviously virtually gone</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0060">so but it's very hard <pause dur="short"/> I mean up there they're very isolated anyway aren't they <pause dur="short"/> I know they've got their friends around there but you know they're two old people you know and it's not easy for them to get around at the best of times you know so <pause dur="short"/> I <unclear/> it's a very the weather up there is never very good</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0086">right</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0060">so I mean for me I would always you know you get you know you're isolated already cos of your age and your frailty and if it's always bad weather or it always seems like it's bad weather and you know it must get quite depressing for them I would of thought I mean when we went when we first went up there foolishly I went first in January <pause dur="short"/> and it was so cold <pause dur="short"/> I mean it there was a constant gale blowing across the way wasn't there? Always <pause dur="short"/> I mean I was  I was  in like eh like three or four layers and then like a great big coat over the top woolly hat and a scarf around like this <pause dur="short"/> and I was still cold when I was out in the wind wasn't I? And we've got photos what I don't think I've coped them they must be on the old computer <pause dur="short"/> but eh there's photos where I'm I'm out taking photos of things there's photos from like framed by the car window where Hannah's taking it of me from within the car with the engine running to keep warm <pause dur="short"/> she's like I'm not going out there</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0171">I'm not up for <unclear/></u>
<u n="1384" who="S0060">we went to eh Skara Brae didn't we? And you stayed in the car cos it was too cold</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0086">fair enough <pause dur="short"/> it does seem like a crazy time of year to go <pause dur="short"/> was that your idea?</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0171">usually is my idea?</u>
<u n="1387" who="S0060">we even went <pause dur="short"/> we went back no when we went back for your mum's wedding in June?</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0171">yeah</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0060">that was alright wannit? It was quite nice <pause dur="short"/> it was a little bit windy but it was quite nice</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0171">it was better</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0060">yeah em but eh <pause dur="short"/> but yeah</u>
<u n="1392" who="S0086">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's not somewhere I would definitely think of as a holiday destination unless I had family there</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0060">ah but <pause dur="short"/> it's beautiful</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0086">I'm sure it is <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0060">but the weather I mean it is just battered off the North Sea</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0086">I'd quite like it if we could invent teleportation</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0060">to go for a visit and then</u>
<u n="1398" who="S0086">to go for a visit <pause dur="short"/> cos I'm sure it is beautiful but I wouldn't want to waste my week holiday somewhere where I wouldn't be warm <pause dur="short"/> not that I'm a sunflower anymore <pause dur="short"/> I used to be but <pause dur="short"/> just to know that it's worse weather there than it is here it</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0060">that's the thing so far you don't really know what's it like till you get there</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0086">it's like the jungle <pause dur="short"/> I'd like to go to the jungle just to have look around <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's fucking scary</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0060">back back to the normal world yeah</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0171"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1403" who="S0060">but eh but no I mean it's a really lovely place <pause dur="short"/> I mean we're very lucky we found it's a bed and well bed and breakfast for want of a better expression but really they they sort of treat you like you're part of the family you know?

<u n="1407" who="S0060">an outdoor jacuzzi you can't really see it working but</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0086">I suppose well they have them in Sweden don't they?</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0060">yeah that's true but they also flog themselves with birch and jump into icy pools</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0086">yeah don't do that <pause dur="short"/> that's dreadful <pause dur="short"/> have you not seen the Muppets? Swedish chef? Yeah I don't know how I'm going to last till the end of the year for a holiday <pause dur="short"/> I did it two years ago when I went to Australia and everyone was going off on a sunny holiday for the summer and was the only to be here</u>

<u n="1412" who="S0171">valium</u>
<u n="1413" who="S0060">valium that's it</u>
<u n="1414" who="S0086">sledgehammer to the brain <pause dur="short"/> knock you out <pause dur="short"/> what you might find is it's more of the idea of it <pause dur="short"/> once you combat the idea you'll be alright <pause dur="short"/> like it is literally just telling yourself this is safer than crossing the road <pause dur="short"/> and how many times do you cross the road</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0171">mm</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0086">do you play the lottery <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0060">you're more likely to win the lottery than die in a plane</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0171">mm</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0060">so if you win the lottery the day before you fly <pause dur="short"/> maybe think again</u>

<u n="1421" who="S0060">but no</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0086">it was really funny actually my <trunc>si</trunc> my friend was saying to me the other day you've got the same chance of walking up to a stranger in the street and guessing their house number than you do of winning the lottery <pause dur="short"/> cos it's that it's the same sort of adds isn't it? Getting a a series of numbers <pause dur="short"/> you don't <pause dur="short"/> you'd have better odds of guessing someone's house number cos there are two</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0060" trans="overlap">you probably have yeah cos there are only going to be</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0086">well maybe three but you know it's not like the stakes where it's like five numbers</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0060">yeah no its <pause dur="short"/> I mean I've not done the lottery for years but I remember when I first started working we had a syndicate at work and for a year it was only the Saturday lottery then and for a solidly for a year there was I think it was like eight of us did it <pause dur="short"/> we used to pay into the syndicate and we used to have two tickets each and it was every Saturday for a year and I don't think even won a tenner</u>

<u n="1427" who="S0060">in all that time <pause dur="short"/> you know we <pause dur="short"/> it would've been better to just keep the money in our pocket type of thing</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0171">part from those bus drivers of course</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0086">did you hear there's a guy guy in the states I think it was</u>

<u n="1432" who="S0171">no no this is a different story</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0060">no okay <pause dur="short"/> go on then you tell the story that you're going to tell</u>
