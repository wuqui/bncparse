<u n="534" who="S0314">didn't you?</u>
<u n="535" who="S0269">no so latin I struggled <pause dur="short"/> I dropped that after two years</u>
<u n="536" who="S0314">mm</u>
<u n="537" who="S0269">no so I couldn't cope with that but on the science side of course I was</u>
<u n="538" who="S0266">was that when you went to secondary school from primary</u>
<u n="539" who="S0269">yeah</u>
<u n="540" who="S0314" trans="overlap">you are talking about?</u>
<u n="541" who="S0269">my first two years in grammar school</u>

<u n="543" who="S0269">yeah and I did it for two years and then dropped it</u>
<u n="544" who="S0266">why? because the others did they have a head start on you?</u>
<u n="545" who="S0269">well because they understood about English grammar</u>
<u n="546" who="S0266">why? because</u>
<u n="547" who="S0269">well because they had been taught it in primary school whereas at at <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="548" who="S0314">but at <anon type="place"/> you you would probably have been speaking with erm not necessarily grammatically correctly you would have been</u>

<u n="557" who="S0269">yeah</u>
<u n="558" who="S0314" trans="overlap">that that that would be a problem</u>
<u n="559" who="S0269">that's right</u>
<u n="560" who="S0314">yeah</u>
<u n="561" who="S0269">and the only thing that carried me through was because er when it came to the sciences and then came to sport of course I was way in front of</u>

<u n="665" who="S0314">well I mean <pause dur="short"/> my husband and also our for both of them to admit that that's what they did</u>
<u n="666" who="S0269">well I was very lucky with my two kids because they they went to a comprehensive school the other side of <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> but there was a headmaster there who was a real driver who understood this sort of thing that you've just been talking about now</u>
<u n="667" who="S0314">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="668" who="S0269" trans="overlap">er and <pause dur="short"/> they were really pushed by Dr Y</u>
<u n="669" who="S0314">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="670" who="S0269" trans="overlap">down at <anon type="place"/> because the first year that our <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was at comprehensive school he got us in and he said <trunc>you</trunc>you've got a real bright cookie here and she'll she'll go far</u>
<u n="671" who="S0314">mm</u>
