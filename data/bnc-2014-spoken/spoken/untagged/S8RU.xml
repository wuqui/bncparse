<u n="143" who="S0538">they're under cover they they can walk around <pause dur="short"/> they're not tied up</u>
<u n="144" who="S0537">yeah but in summer they'd prefer to be out it can be hot and stuffy and horrible</u>
<u n="145" who="S0538" trans="overlap">well I think</u>
<u n="146" who="S0537">surely?</u>

<u n="148" who="S0537" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0538">they'll probably <pause dur="short"/> take them <pause dur="short"/> take them out onto some of <pause dur="short"/> the the higher ground that isn't as wet</u>
<u n="150" who="S0537">mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0538"><trunc>a</trunc>and they probably have a <pause dur="short"/> er a month or two <pause dur="short"/> where they <pause dur="short"/> where they graze out but <pause dur="short"/> the bulk of the time <vocal desc="yawn"/> er they're indoors</u>
<u n="152" who="S0537">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0538">zero grazed</u>

<u n="161" who="S0538" trans="overlap">I don't think <unclear>it was</unclear> really suitable</u>
<u n="162" who="S0537">I think we might look at <trunc>ano</trunc></u>
<u n="163" who="S0538" trans="overlap">we've been spoilt</u>
<u n="164" who="S0539">mm</u>

<u n="169" who="S0537" trans="overlap">I know but it's the heated floor they don't survive</u>
<u n="170" who="S0538" trans="overlap">yeah and it just takes <pause dur="short"/> nine months to <pause dur="short"/> get all rid of all the blinking <pause dur="short"/> needles that fall from them <pause dur="short"/> takes twelve months to clean up after it <pause dur="short"/> it just isn't worth it <pause dur="short"/> and that and these <pause dur="short"/> some of these er <pause dur="short"/> artificial trees are very very real looking</u>
<u n="171" who="S0537">well there's</u>
