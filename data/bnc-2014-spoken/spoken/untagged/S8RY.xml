<u n="21" who="S0202" trans="overlap">put herself out of this situation</u>
<u n="22" who="S0208">out so that she could bitch and moan and whine about</u>

<u n="25" who="S0202" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="26" who="S0208">when we go for <trunc>bar</trunc> when we used to go for barbecues you could see her and she would be like it was just so and she has that way of doing it like exactly that mannerism like going so and like sort of like <pause dur="short"/> sucking her lips in a bit as if she's sucking them in</u>
<u n="27" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0208">but that's just how <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I'd <trunc>neve</trunc> well she's just like that</u>
<u n="29" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah that's just who she is yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0208">my mum <pause dur="short"/> all of a sudden <pause dur="short"/> a couple of years ago started doing the exact same thing <pause dur="short"/> but like using the exact expressions <pause dur="short"/> the exact mannerisms as <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I never mentioned it to my mum because I was like right <vocal desc="misc"/> cos because I was like the few times I had mentioned that thing with supper with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> it turned into a massive argument which was like for a simple</u>
<u n="31" who="S0202" trans="overlap">cos she got defensive cos she knew exactly what she were doing</u>
<u n="32" who="S0208">exactly</u>
<u n="33" who="S0202" trans="overlap">and you were picking up on it</u>
<u n="34" who="S0208">and it turned into a massive argument and then my dad being the peacekeeper that he is would always come to me and be like you're not handling the situation appropriately <pause dur="short"/> go apologise to your mum <pause dur="short"/> and I would just be like what the fuck is actually happening can I not actually have an opinion in this house <pause dur="short"/> it's like you always just gonna be there so that you can just keep the peace regardless of what I'm feeling or whatever so I ended up having arguments with my dad about it just for my mum's benefit</u>
<u n="35" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0208"><pause dur="short"/> which doesn't happen any more that was back when I was a bit younger <pause dur="short"/> erm going through my like rebellious stage <pause dur="short"/> but erm <vocal desc="cough"/> I hadn't mentioned it to my mum cos I knew what would happen and er I just went to England and it wasn't even me that brought it up it was my sister it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> she was like you know that face that mum does that really fucking pisses me off and she was like erm so</u>

<u n="44" who="S0208">you swear a lot but like I'm not stealing your personality it's just because <pause dur="short"/> I've been around it and because obviously at home I <pause dur="short"/> watch it a little bit more</u>
