<u n="1" who="S0208"><unclear/> can never ever <unclear/></u>
<u n="2" who="S0202">I've never tried to learn to be honest <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="3" who="S0208">you should erm try some of the thanks oh actually no because it's too you need a guitar to do that <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="4" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="5" who="S0208">I was going to say go on Youtube and like try some of the self tutorials I've tried some of those and like if I watch it I can do it but then as soon as I go away or shut down the Youtube video or something <unclear/> forget everything</u>
<u n="6" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="7" who="S0208">just sitting there looking at it like what do I do with this</u>
<u n="8" who="S0202">there's this theory and it's basically if you do ten thousand hours of something you'll become you'll be an expert at it</u>
<u n="9" who="S0208">really?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0202">yeah like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> my friend were telling me and like it's just basically as simple as it is if you put ten thousand hours into something you'll be <trunc>re</trunc> you'll be able to do it and be an expert at it</u>
<u n="11" who="S0208">hm</u>
<u n="12" who="S0202">right I don't <unclear>actually know</unclear> who that is but</u>
<u n="13" who="S0208" trans="overlap">that's interesting though I guess you'd have to do it pretty much full time cos if you think about it ten thousand hours if if you're doing like an hour a week there's no way you'd become an expert</u>
<u n="14" who="S0202">no</u>
<u n="15" who="S0208">maybe ten thousand consecutive hours <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0202">mm I don't know</u>
<u n="17" who="S0208">I don't know like I really love music and everything I really enjoy it but I really am just no good at it</u>
<u n="18" who="S0202">ah I'm no good at singing oh I'm good at <trunc>playi</trunc> learning instruments like we used to be able to play piano when I were a kid but I never kept it up so</u>
<u n="19" who="S0208">that's cool ah I was the same I used to do piano lessons and then like just stopped when I moved to <anon type="place"/> but then I lost everything like I can't even read music any more</u>
<u n="20" who="S0202" trans="overlap">you do don't you yeah I used to be able to read music but I can't any more</u>
<u n="21" who="S0208">it's not like riding a bike when you just get on it and remember everything</u>
<u n="22" who="S0202" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="23" who="S0208">unfortunately</u>
<u n="24" who="S0202">it's one of them things that if you don't keep it up you just you just forget how to do it don't you?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0208">it's really annoying though cos I used to love it and like but it was different in England like the way they did the music classes like it was so different because when I took up drums when I <trunc>li</trunc> when I came here erm quite a few years ago now like I still had to do the note reading next to it and it was two separate classes so it was an hour of drum lessons in a week and then another hour of reading music like sheet music</u>
<u n="26" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="27" who="S0208">I was like I'm sorry that's not going to help me at all I'd rather have an extra hour playing drums and they were like no you have to</u>
<u n="28" who="S0202">I used to do two <trunc>ho</trunc> three hours a week of piano lessons and then two hours a week music reading</u>
<u n="29" who="S0208">I just found it stupid I understand for things where you need to read music but it's like the drum sheet music you had like three colours it was the same principle like the ones that were black was one beat the ones that were white in the middle two beats like et cetera et cetera was the same thing</u>
<u n="30" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0208">and I was just like I don't need to sit through an hour <vocal desc="laugh"/> but like I really hated the teacher as well he looked like an owl and he had like a monobrow and he was so cruel and I'd never practice because I fucking hated it like literally I'd dread that lesson and It would he'd put on like one of those metronome things</u>
<u n="32" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0208">and you'd have to read it and then bit by bit you'd have to sing so that you'd learn to recognise it and I know that's a really good skill to have but it pissed me off so much I stopped <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="34" who="S0202">yeah I'd love to learn how to play guitar <pause dur="short"/> fucking <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> oh my god she's so spoiled she eh she mentioned to her dad that she wanted she she'd fancy learning how to play the guitar so went out and bought her a guitar</u>
<u n="35" who="S0208">jesus wow</u>
<u n="36" who="S0202">it's how fucking spoiled she is he literally just went out and bought her a guitar like a brand new six hundred pound guitar</u>
<u n="37" who="S0208">shit</u>
<u n="38" who="S0202"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was so pissed off cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s been learning ages to play guitar</u>
<u n="39" who="S0208">yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0202">and she saved up for ages to buy herself a guitar and then obviously <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got jealous that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> were doing something that she couldn't do so she just mentioned to daddy that she wanted one and he went out and got it got her it</u>
<u n="41" who="S0208">why don't you just suggest to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like I'm quite interested in learning guitar would you be happy if I borrowed in every now and then?</u>
<u n="42" who="S0202">no I'm not</u>
<u n="43" who="S0208" trans="overlap">cos you could use hers</u>
<u n="44" who="S0202">I'm not giving her that fucking pleasure</u>
<u n="45" who="S0208">well my uncle</u>
<u n="46" who="S0202" trans="overlap">it would be an opportunity for her to brag and be like look what I can do and I'm doing it so much faster than you like if I'm going to learn I would tell her that I were learning</u>
<u n="47" who="S0208">right <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="48" who="S0202">because she'd just gloat like look how much better I am than you and just I'd rather not get into it's not a competition do you know what I mean I don't want it to become that like</u>
<u n="49" who="S0208" trans="overlap">yeah that's what it used to be like with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and piano cos like she I did music like piano lessons when I was really young like when I lived in England and I stopped because I didn't well I cos moved here but I kept playing but like just learning songs that I wanted to learn</u>
<u n="50" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0208">so I'd go on Youtube tutorials or I'd just listen to a song and just try and pick it up it was just for fun</u>
<u n="52" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0208">and erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> started doing eh piano lessons so I was like oh I used to play piano we should like do stuff together so we did and it was genuinely really fun and like we used to do music and stuff but then at school like when we were doing music and like we were allowed to use instruments and stuff and she would always like one up</u>
<u n="54" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0208">she always had to and like I told her I was learning this song it's like A River Flows In You by that Chinese guy I don't remember his name</u>
<u n="56" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="57" who="S0208">really beautiful and I was really struggling to learn it cos obviously I couldn't really read the music or anything so I was sort of learning learning slowly and it was when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was still living here and he's erm he's actually amazing</u>
<u n="58" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="59" who="S0208">he can listen to a song and just play it</u>
<u n="60" who="S0202">really?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0208" trans="overlap">and if yeah he taught himself Pirates of the Caribbean the whole way through just from listening to it</u>
<u n="62" who="S0202"><unclear/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0208">I know so jealous <vocal desc="laugh"/> but erm <pause dur="short"/> he was the one that started teaching me that's why like I learned a bit and then in music cos everyone would sort of do what they wanted and I was just showing <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I was like this is a song I really want to learn I was like I'm struggling obviously it's not very pretty but I showed her the beginning next week when we had music she came back and she played it all like perfectly and everyone was like oh my god you're so amazing</u>
<u n="64" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0208">I was just sitting there like oh <pause dur="short"/> I don't want to learn it any more <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="66" who="S0202">it ruins it doesn't it? like that's</u>
<u n="67" who="S0208" trans="overlap">it it really does it's so petty but it does it does for a ruin it for you it takes the fun out</u>
<u n="68" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah and that's why and that's why I don't want to tell <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that if I do start learning guitar I don't want to tell her I don't want to <trunc>l</trunc><trunc>l</trunc>let her know because it'll be turned into a competition I don't want it to turn into a competition like I want to learn guitar I've always wanted to learn guitar and it's not got anything to do with her or anyone else but I don't want it to turn into that and like I want to learn at my pace and enjoy learning</u>
<u n="69" who="S0208" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="70" who="S0202">instead of it being like all the <trunc>ch</trunc> I've just learned like you can't do it so I'm better than you</u>
<u n="71" who="S0208" trans="overlap">mm that's why I like doing music with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because there's nothing competitive at all in there</u>
<u n="72" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0208">and like erm there was something she wanted to do by Bombay Bicycle Club that I didn't really know and she taught me because like I listened to it a few times and then we tried singing it and doing harmonies but like my tempo was wrong</u>
<u n="74" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0208">because I didn't know it very well and it wasn't at all patronising or rude or anything the way she was doing it she just taught me it and then we did it together</u>
<u n="76" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0208">and it wasn't a</u>
<u n="78" who="S0202" trans="overlap">it's much more fun like that though right?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0208" trans="overlap">exactly exactly</u>
<u n="80" who="S0202">it's so much more fun learning together and like saying well you don't know how to do this but I do and I don't know how to do this but you do so let's just learn together let's just teach each <trunc>othe</trunc> each other things let's grow with each other</u>
<u n="81" who="S0208" trans="overlap">exactly</u>
<u n="82" who="S0202">and it not be a competition</u>
<u n="83" who="S0208">and that's what we'd always used to do and like lately because she's been teaching herself guitar a little bit she did the song on guitar and like we did the harmonies and we we like kind of perfected it and like it was like our song that we were doing we wanted to film it but we just never got around to doing it</u>
<u n="84" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0208">like to put on Youtube or something but it was just it was fun and easy and she suggested to me she's like oh do you want to do some music? I'm like yeah okay it's not like <vocal desc="sigh"/> she's so much better than me though</u>
<u n="86" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="87" who="S0208">it's not like I can play guitar and you can't so watch me play it's</u>
<u n="88" who="S0202">yeah yeah and I hate that like that's why I think that's why me and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> have grown apart because that's what it turned into in the end because like when we were talking about essays and talking about what we were writing about and stuff like that like it turned into that and I just like I'm not interested in having a conversation with you like I'm here to do a degree you're here to do the same degree it doesn't have to be a competition</u>
<u n="89" who="S0208">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0202">like</u>
<u n="91" who="S0208">did I tell you about me and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>? have I told you that about her parents and stuff?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0202">about what?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0208">like how well it's <trunc>no</trunc> it's not her parents it's my mum more than anything and her parents quite a lot that <vocal desc="misc"/> sorry I was quite a good student like I enjoyed doing it and getting good marks like for myself</u>
<u n="94" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0208">and like for my overall year grade and stuff and she was the same like we were both quite ambitious and driven and stuff but my mum and her parents would always turn everything into a competition like literally it was awful like <vocal desc="cough"/> I'd get say seventeen in an exam and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> would get a fourteen or something and her parents would be like oh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got this like why didn't you do better sort of thing but vice versa so if I didn't do as good as <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> my mum would be like oh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> told me that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got an eighteen isn't that fantastic? you could've done that and I'd just be like I'm sorry I was like I'm sorry I can't be as perfect as <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I was like what do you want from me?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0208">I was like I tried my hardest and I didn't do as good like so what and then when I got my final results and I got the erm <unclear/> which is like like the highest merit for <unclear/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got <foreign lang="fre">bien</foreign> which is one underneath</u>
<u n="98" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0208">that's not a big deal we got like one point something difference overall</u>
<u n="100" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0208">and my mum was just like oh yeah look you beat <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <unclear/> and I was like mum I don't care</u>
<u n="102" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="103" who="S0208">I was like stop turning it into that like I'm not even happy at the fact that I did so much better than my friends because they all proper like sort of shunned me because they only just scraped it and stuff</u>
<u n="104" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0208"><unclear/> I felt bad enough as it is when I shouldn't so please don't make it worse</u>
