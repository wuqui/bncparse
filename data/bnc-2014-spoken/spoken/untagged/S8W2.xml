<u n="3" who="S0670"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="4" who="S0669">we're er gonna be discussing two theories cos I wanted to hear your thoughts on like whether you think they're very accurate one of them is more about infants than erm actually they're both about like children</u>
<u n="5" who="S0671"><unclear>quiet in here</unclear></u>
<u n="6" who="S0669">erm yeah so the first one is a theory by Piaget have you heard of Piaget?</u>
<u n="7" who="S0670">Piaget?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0669">yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0671">didn't he invent pasta? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="10" who="S0670">is he?</u>
<u n="11" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="12" who="S0670">really? it's just</u>
<u n="13" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0670">mine wasn't much better I was gonna come up with some joke about him being erm some concerto pianist</u>
<u n="15" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0669">well Piaget</u>
<u n="17" who="S0671" trans="overlap">sorry <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> sorry</u>
<u n="18" who="S0669">okay guys this is a serious <vocal desc="laugh"/> discussion</u>
<u n="19" who="S0671">sorry</u>
<u n="20" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0669">so Piaget erm oh</u>
<u n="22" who="S0671">oh</u>
<u n="23" who="S0670">nice pen</u>
<u n="24" who="S0669">yeah great isn't it? I just thought it would help us if we discussed using this visual aid</u>
<u n="25" who="S0670">yes</u>
<u n="26" who="S0669">of the whiteboard</u>
<u n="27" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="28" who="S0669">Piaget okay so Piaget is one of those like is one of those psychologists that's has really changed the way we view children and how they develop in terms of how they learn new things and how they think</u>
<u n="29" who="S0671">okay <unclear/></u>
<u n="30" who="S0669" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="31" who="S0670">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0669">Piaget instead of like emphasising the parents' involvement he really believes that children are actively trying to understand the world around them they're actively doing their own learning and it's they're really independently exploring and trying to figure it out for themselves</u>
<u n="33" who="S0670">yeah</u>
<u n="34" who="S0669">and it's important as parents</u>
<u n="35" who="S0671">mm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0669">that we let them do that</u>
<u n="37" who="S0670">yep</u>
<u n="38" who="S0669">so he says there's two aspects of his model he says that when a child sees something it so a child might see like a zebra and they've never seen one before and they erm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0670" trans="overlap">really? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="40" who="S0669">do a process called accommodation <trunc>accommoda</trunc> I can't spell accommodation</u>
<u n="41" who="S0671" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="42" who="S0669">so when they do accommodation they go hold on that's a new thing what am I gonna how am I gonna figure that out? like what is that? so they go oh I've seen a horse before cos it has four legs and erm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0671" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="44" who="S0669">a similar head</u>
<u n="45" who="S0670" trans="overlap">so they'll look for similarities in whatever they've</u>
<u n="46" who="S0669" trans="overlap">so they look</u>
<u n="47" who="S0670">come across?</u>
<u n="48" who="S0669">yes well done <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0671">oh come on <unclear/></u>

<u n="58" who="S0669">yeah so they they</u>
<u n="59" who="S0670"><vocal desc="laugh"/> good job <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="60" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="61" who="S0669">they look for like horses however when they're like comparing it</u>
<u n="62" who="S0670" trans="overlap">but it can't find them cos it's separate</u>
<u n="63" who="S0669">yeah</u>
<u n="64" who="S0670" trans="overlap">there's no horses</u>
<u n="65" who="S0669">so the er</u>

<u n="73" who="S0669">shush you so then they go but horses don't have stripes so they're in this state of disequilibrium</u>
<u n="74" who="S0671">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0669">equilibrium and erm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0671"><trunc>disequil</trunc> yes</u>
<u n="77" who="S0669">and <vocal desc="laugh"/> er they're going oh I'm not liking this I can't figure it out and they start going okay this is a new thing and I'm gonna learn that so they go okay they have stripes they must be different and they sort of seek they er explore eventually someone they hear that it's a zebra and when they hear and learn the term zebra they have <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>is it</unclear>? <pause dur="short"/> whoops I've done it the wrong way round I'm very pleased we've discussed this <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="78" who="S0670" trans="overlap">accommodation is the last thing isn't it?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0669">yes <vocal desc="laugh"/> and assimilation</u>
<u n="80" who="S0670" trans="overlap">cos they're accommodating</u>
<u n="81" who="S0669">is the first thing</u>
<u n="82" who="S0671" trans="overlap">oh assimilating</u>
<u n="83" who="S0669"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0670"><trunc>assi</trunc> oh okay yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0669" trans="overlap">good thing that is in my notes</u>
<u n="86" who="S0670" trans="overlap">cos things assimilate to other things</u>
<u n="87" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="88" who="S0669">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="89" who="S0670">and they're accommodating in their head for a new</u>
<u n="90" who="S0669" trans="overlap">er yes</u>
<u n="91" who="S0670">erm concept or object</u>
<u n="92" who="S0669">indeed so this is a continuous process and this happens like all the time like whenever they're</u>
<u n="93" who="S0671" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="94" who="S0669" trans="overlap">doing a new thing so they're always like looking for new things however Piaget also thinks that we go through stages</u>
<u n="95" who="S0670">need a hand there buddy?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0669"><vocal desc="laugh"/> erm we go through stages which are discontinuous does anyone know what discontinuous means?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0670">not continuing</u>
<u n="98" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0670">yes <unclear>this is</unclear></u>
<u n="100" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="101" who="S0670"><unclear/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0669" trans="overlap"><unclear>have</unclear> another piece of chocolate</u>
<u n="103" who="S0670">wahoo <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="104" who="S0669" trans="overlap">erm yeah so infants I'm not gonna outline all the stages because you'll get bored but I want to see whether you could you could erm apply this to education but</u>
<u n="105" who="S0670" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="106" who="S0669">in brief every single age group of infants have different like stages that they can cope with in their thinking</u>
<u n="107" who="S0670">yep</u>
<u n="108" who="S0669">so from the age of nought to two</u>
<u n="109" who="S0670"><unclear>sensei</unclear></u>
<u n="110" who="S0669">they <vocal desc="laugh"/> go to the <trunc>sen</trunc>sensory motor</u>
<u n="111" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="112" who="S0670">thought it was an I</u>
<u n="113" who="S0669" trans="overlap">stage</u>
<u n="114" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="115" who="S0669">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> motor stage</u>
<u n="116" who="S0671">is that things like like er holding stuff that feels different?</u>
<u n="117" who="S0669">yeah yeah sort of sort of yeah but</u>
<u n="118" who="S0670" trans="overlap">tactile stuff?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0669">basically yeah so the difference between like the senses and moving and all this sort of things</u>
<u n="120" who="S0670">hence</u>
<u n="121" who="S0669">they</u>
<u n="122" who="S0670" trans="overlap">sensory motor</u>
<u n="123" who="S0669">exactly</u>
<u n="124" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="125" who="S0669">well done so</u>
<u n="126" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="127" who="S0669">they in this stage they're really trying to figure out cause and effect relationships</u>
<u n="128" who="S0671">okay</u>
<u n="129" who="S0670">oh okay</u>
<u n="130" who="S0669">cause and effect relationships blah blah blah and erm a thing called object permanence so they when a when a pen disappears from view infants find it really difficult to believe that it still exists even though it's <unclear/></u>
<u n="131" who="S0671" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="132" who="S0670" trans="overlap">hence the classic game peek-a-boo when you hide your face it's that they</u>
<u n="133" who="S0669" trans="overlap">exactly</u>
<u n="134" who="S0670">don't understand where you've gone</u>
<u n="135" who="S0669">they</u>
<u n="136" who="S0671" trans="overlap">ah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="137" who="S0670">but I got your notes so it's <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="138" who="S0669">mm exactly so that is a really good</u>
<u n="139" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="140" who="S0669">application</u>
<u n="141" who="S0670">yes</u>
<u n="142" who="S0669">to real life <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="143" who="S0671">oh good grief</u>
<u n="144" who="S0670">that's three nil <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="145" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="146" who="S0669">so erm given this given that children like need to be able to explore and they learn best when they explore independently and learn this stuff on their own how do you think we can teach children to do cause and effect relationships in real life?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0670">leaving them alone to discover stuff like leave a baby next to a fire and wait for it to realise</u>
<u n="148" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="149" who="S0670">that it can burn itself</u>
<u n="150" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="151" who="S0670">I mean it's to be fair that is cause and effect</u>
<u n="152" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="153" who="S0669">it is <vocal desc="laugh"/> cause and effect <vocal desc="laugh"/> if a little inhumane</u>
<u n="154" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="155" who="S0670">I mean obviously you wouldn't do that that was called a joke cos</u>
<u n="156" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="157" who="S0670">but it's the same concept</u>
<u n="158" who="S0669">but if they were in day care</u>
<u n="159" who="S0671" trans="overlap">oh okay yeah yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="S0669">what toys would you give them?</u>
<u n="161" who="S0671">probably things that</u>
<u n="162" who="S0670">burn them</u>
<u n="163" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="164" who="S0671"><unclear>no okay</unclear></u>
<u n="165" who="S0670"><vocal desc="laugh"/> erm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0671">well like things like you said earlier that feel different to each other so like</u>
<u n="167" who="S0669" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0671">something that's smooth and then something that's</u>
<u n="169" who="S0670"><vocal desc="laugh"/> feels like ouch <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="170" who="S0671"><trunc>n</trunc></u>
<u n="171" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="172" who="S0670">I'm sorry</u>
<u n="173" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="174" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">I'm so sorry</u>
<u n="175" who="S0671">I dunno you'd try and get as much different as many different senses in there as you can</u>
<u n="176" who="S0669">yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0671">as many different things as you can as well <unclear>well</unclear> it's and the coming and going things <unclear>as well</unclear> you could have something that</u>
<u n="178" who="S0669">well</u>
<u n="179" who="S0670">so</u>
<u n="180" who="S0669">one toy that you could use</u>
<u n="181" who="S0670" trans="overlap">would is that the shape one? where you have the shaped toys and then the box which has the holes in and <unclear>all that shit</unclear>?</u>
<u n="182" who="S0671" trans="overlap">oh I think that's the next stage mate</u>
<u n="183" who="S0670">oh is that a next stage?</u>
<u n="184" who="S0671">well I think that's the next stage</u>
<u n="185" who="S0669" trans="overlap">probably but the this stage</u>
<u n="186" who="S0670"><vocal desc="laugh"/> our teacher knows so much</u>
<u n="187" who="S0669">I don't know that</u>
<u n="188" who="S0670" trans="overlap">maybe it's</u>
<u n="189" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="190" who="S0669">what you could use are toys that are squeaky toys so when they squeeze them</u>
<u n="191" who="S0670">it creates a noise</u>
<u n="192" who="S0669">it creates a noise so they</u>
<u n="193" who="S0671" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="194" who="S0669">but they only learn that from squeezing it themselves if we were to squeeze that for them they wouldn't learn it probably</u>
<u n="195" who="S0670" trans="overlap">so that's motor and sensory working</u>
<u n="196" who="S0671" trans="overlap">oh yeah good</u>
<u n="197" who="S0670" trans="overlap">in in coherence because they're using motor skills</u>
<u n="198" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="199" who="S0670">to squeeze something and then sensory</u>
<u n="200" who="S0669" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="201" who="S0670">is there</u>
<u n="202" who="S0671">okay</u>
<u n="203" who="S0669" trans="overlap">or like a button and it makes a noise like music</u>
<u n="204" who="S0671" trans="overlap">okay okay cool</u>
<u n="205" who="S0669">musical noises okay</u>
<u n="206" who="S0671">or a jack-in-the-box</u>

<u n="212" who="S0670">I call this psychology is called positive reinforcement</u>
<u n="213" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="214" who="S0669">so erm</u>
<u n="215" who="S0671">you're really good at teaching</u>

<u n="228" who="S0669">I'm just gonna seek my notes just to check I've got the right order</u>
<u n="229" who="S0671">can I ask a question about Piaget?</u>
<u n="230" who="S0669">of course you can</u>
<u n="231" who="S0670">mm</u>
<u n="232" who="S0671">so his model is that children it's more to do with children?</u>
<u n="233" who="S0669">yeah it's all about the children</u>
<u n="234" who="S0671">but the last stage would only you said</u>
<u n="235" who="S0670">the cognitive</u>
<u n="236" who="S0671" trans="overlap">they only find out it's a zebra when someone tells them so if it's</u>
<u n="237" who="S0669" trans="overlap">wait wait</u>
<u n="238" who="S0671" trans="overlap">all the children then</u>
<u n="239" who="S0670" trans="overlap">oh yes that's a good question cos what if?</u>
<u n="240" who="S0671" trans="overlap">is it literally</u>
<u n="241" who="S0669" trans="overlap">wait so</u>
<u n="242" who="S0671" trans="overlap">all down to the parents</u>
<u n="243" who="S0670" trans="overlap">what if no one <unclear>recalled</unclear>?</u>
<u n="244" who="S0671" trans="overlap">teaching? or else they're or else they're just stuck in</u>
<u n="245" who="S0669">that's so true</u>
<u n="246" who="S0671" trans="overlap">assimilation and</u>
<u n="247" who="S0670">oh so would would</u>
<u n="248" who="S0671" trans="overlap">and <unclear>the next one</unclear></u>
<u n="249" who="S0670">would it come a stage where a child would come to its own accommodation? it would label an object as different and know it is different and give it another name <unclear>perhaps</unclear></u>
<u n="250" who="S0671" trans="overlap">if there were just children a new language would developed to accommodate that</u>
<u n="251" who="S0670" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="252" who="S0669">mm</u>
<u n="253" who="S0670" trans="overlap">no it would wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="254" who="S0669">it is true though</u>
<u n="255" who="S0671" trans="overlap">so really the <trunc>chil</trunc> adults are only needed to accommodate children into society so it's a societal</u>
<u n="256" who="S0670" trans="overlap">into the current society</u>
<u n="257" who="S0671" trans="overlap">into the culture</u>
<u n="258" who="S0669">oh that's so interesting</u>
<u n="259" who="S0670">yeah</u>
<u n="260" who="S0669">but do you think but if the parents if they're just hearing it do you think that's still them? they're still exploring the world they're still just hearing it or do you think?</u>
<u n="261" who="S0671">oh okay oh that's deep</u>
<u n="262" who="S0670">quite mm</u>
<u n="263" who="S0669">but I guess if the</u>
<u n="264" who="S0671" trans="overlap">oh that's true it's their job to like fit it together</u>
<u n="265" who="S0669">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="266" who="S0671" trans="overlap">yeah yeah fair enough</u>
<u n="267" who="S0670" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="268" who="S0671" trans="overlap">fair <trunc>f</trunc>fair okay</u>
<u n="269" who="S0669">but I guess it is er it is true the parents someone else as an adult has to say it cos they</u>
<u n="270" who="S0671" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="271" who="S0669">can't read an infant can't read</u>
<u n="272" who="S0671">no</u>
<u n="273" who="S0669">so</u>
<u n="274" who="S0670">so er here's a question that I've got is that you know on Piaget so assimilation is the moment where an infant will realise something is different and identify it as different</u>
<u n="275" who="S0669">yeah</u>
<u n="276" who="S0670">it won't label it but it will realise oh that's not quite what I've seen before at what stage does does this stop becoming a constant process? because if an infant sees a horse as a a picture of a horse</u>
<u n="277" who="S0669">mm</u>
<u n="278" who="S0670">and you teach it that's a horse it'll learn that's a horse</u>
<u n="279" who="S0669">yeah</u>
<u n="280" who="S0670">then if it sees a horse in real life it'll again recognise that's a horse or recognise that from a photo at what stage does an object become different? at what point would it begin to assimilate something different? would it be a different colour to a horse? would it have to be a completely different species? or?</u>
<u n="281" who="S0669">yeah</u>
<u n="282" who="S0671" trans="overlap">yeah that's a good question</u>
<u n="283" who="S0669">oh I guess obviously</u>
<u n="284" who="S0671" trans="overlap">you don't have to know the answers</u>
<u n="285" who="S0669">the amount</u>
<u n="286" who="S0670" trans="overlap">no <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="287" who="S0669">of experience a child <trunc>h</trunc>has had like is important</u>
<u n="288" who="S0670">mm</u>
<u n="289" who="S0671">oh that's true</u>
<u n="290" who="S0669">there will be like much broader general categories like basic level as it's called oh no superordinate level categories so they'll like think it's really broad and they'll call quite a few things horses</u>
<u n="291" who="S0670">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="292" who="S0669" trans="overlap">but I think as they gain more experience</u>
<u n="293" who="S0670">mm</u>
<u n="294" who="S0669">they'll be like hang on a minute maybe that's not a horse or maybe that's a different horse and then they get their category levels of specificness they it gets more developed to subordinate categories</u>
<u n="295" who="S0670">but they do I I assume babies understand that things are different because although if you teach like <unclear>and sticking with the horse then</unclear> if you teach an infant that's a horse</u>
<u n="296" who="S0669">mm</u>
<u n="297" who="S0670">it might see a dog and say</u>
<u n="298" who="S0669">exactly</u>
<u n="299" who="S0670" trans="overlap">little horse</u>
<u n="300" who="S0669">yeah</u>
<u n="301" who="S0670">but it would recognise for example a rock as not being a horse but if it didn't know what a rock was</u>
<u n="302" who="S0669" trans="overlap">so when</u>
<u n="303" who="S0670" trans="overlap">does it just understand that I know what that is I don't know what any of the other things are?</u>
<u n="304" who="S0669">it's more when children are younger</u>
<u n="305" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low"><unclear>that's a good question</unclear></u>
<u n="306" who="S0669">they're very much relying on their perception to make and their different like parts of</u>
<u n="307" who="S0671">reality</u>
<u n="308" who="S0669">yeah the different parts of things in order to make</u>
<u n="309" who="S0670">okay</u>
<u n="310" who="S0669">judgments so they're</u>
<u n="311" who="S0670" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="312" who="S0669">they're very simple it's like how many legs has it got? and and like if it has legs or it doesn't have legs what colour is it? it's very simple</u>
<u n="313" who="S0671" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="314" who="S0669">so I think in terms of like a rock and a horse they know that they're different but a horse and a dog because of it they're so perceptual they're so relying on like</u>
<u n="315" who="S0670">on basic structure</u>
<u n="316" who="S0671"><unclear>yeah yeah okay that's cool</unclear></u>
<u n="317" who="S0669" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="318" who="S0670" trans="overlap">they <unclear/> identify things oh it's got four legs</u>
<u n="319" who="S0669">yeah</u>
<u n="320" who="S0670" trans="overlap">therefore it is</u>
<u n="321" who="S0669">okay</u>
<u n="322" who="S0671" trans="overlap">yeah that's cool</u>
