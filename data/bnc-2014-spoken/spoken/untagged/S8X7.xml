<u n="1" who="S0086">you manned up?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="3" who="S0086">that's harsh man</u>
<u n="4" who="S0041">or <unclear/></u>
<u n="5" who="S0086">what did <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> say?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0041">hence why I look like shit this morning cos I spent the night and this morning just crying like a girl</u>
<u n="7" who="S0086">ah mate well you did look really em really away with the fairies this morning <pause dur="short"/> but I I had to go to mum so <pause dur="short"/> I had to leave <pause dur="short"/> I was worried about you</u>
<u n="8" who="S0041">I said to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I said I know it sounds stupid but I'm sick of having shit thrown at me every single time <pause dur="short"/> whether it's crazy <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> or ill dad or stupid divorce or her stealing my savings or having to move job <pause dur="short"/> just I'm sick to death of it <pause dur="short"/> and then in the last minute you think well actually the whole point of this is in my control <pause dur="short"/> hit by a fucking bus <pause dur="short"/> like what is the luck of that? What is the luck of that?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0086">mm <pause dur="short"/> you think you'd be due a break now wouldn't you really? After all that shit <pause dur="short"/> once you've actually found something that you think now this is my career this is what I want to be doing</u>
<u n="10" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0086">oh mate <pause dur="short"/> well suppose the only thing you can do is take it day by day at this point</u>
<u n="12" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0086">go to the doctors tomorrow get the scan take a view on it <pause dur="short"/> are you just going to go to work in the morning or are you going to take the day off?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0041">I'm going to go to work in the morning because if I take the day off they won't pay me</u>
<u n="15" who="S0086">oh yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0041">nice <pause dur="short"/> so I'm going to go to work in the morning <pause dur="short"/> as soon as I get there I'm going to ring the doctors and I'm going to lie through my back teeth and say oh yeah just me I just need you to write me a letter to say that you're happy for the navy to put me forward for my medical <pause dur="short"/> not going to mention anything about needing to be mentally fit <pause dur="short"/> not going to mention that shit</u>
<u n="17" who="S0086">need to know information and they do not need to know that</u>
<u n="18" who="S0041">right <pause dur="short"/> and if he says well what about the haematoma I'll say oh no no it's fine I've told them about it and as long as I go for my scan today and take my scan results to prove that it's just haematoma it's just a bruise really isn't it? And the fines the just need to okay for me to say yes I'm happy to put her forward for it <pause dur="short"/> and hope that he's daft enough to just do it</u>
<u n="19" who="S0086">to be honest if he's anything like my GP he'll be like who are you? What are you? Yes fine come and get this letter <pause dur="short"/> be like I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I don't think he's going to question it cos he sounds like he's not really that bothered <pause dur="short"/> he just was keen to get you out of the doctor's surgery really? He wasn't really engaging with you</u>
<u n="20" who="S0041">no so</u>
<u n="21" who="S0086">yeah well that sounds like a plan <pause dur="short"/> and then leave work at twelve one?</u>
<u n="22" who="S0041">one yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm just going to say to them if you don't want to do it we're going to have a problem cos I'm going to stab it open and you're going to have to deal with it as emergency so your choice</u>
<u n="23" who="S0086">yeah the fork actually turns out yeah</u>
<u n="24" who="S0041">I will literally use the fork</u>
<u n="25" who="S0086">the fork is actually a viable option <pause dur="short"/> who would have thought last week the fork would have been a viable option</u>
<u n="26" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> just going to do it <pause dur="short"/> and I'll tell you what oh my god <pause dur="short"/> the solicitor sent me a letter</u>
<u n="27" who="S0086">national Accident Helpline</u>
<u n="28" who="S0041">well it's Gould Solicitors <pause dur="short"/> oh my god <pause dur="short"/> they're fucking thick as pig shit</u>
<u n="29" who="S0086">oh no</u>
<u n="30" who="S0041">she got the statement wrong the time on it <pause dur="short"/> twelve PM she wrote</u>
<u n="31" who="S0086">Good <pause dur="short"/> wasn't it AM?</u>
<u n="32" who="S0041">yes yes <pause dur="short"/> something else was wrong <pause dur="short"/> I just thought fuck that and ripped it up <pause dur="short"/> sent her an email saying fuck off <pause dur="short"/> if I can't trust you to write a statement you've got no way of representing me not a clue no way <pause dur="short"/> so fuck off</u>
<u n="33" who="S0086">so is that someone that's appointed by National Accident Helpline</u>
<u n="34" who="S0041">yep <pause dur="short"/> no way <pause dur="short"/> can't trust them</u>
<u n="35" who="S0086">can you get someone from Tezza?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0041">I'm going to Barr Ellison</u>
<u n="37" who="S0086">okay fine</u>
<u n="38" who="S0041">and they have a <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was telling me they have an office within the hospital so tomorrow when I'm there I'm gonna go straight to Barr Ellison and do it through them <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> it's just ridiculous that somebody that you don't know that you know just didn't wasn't thinking properly can have so much of an impact <pause dur="short"/> and was sitting here thinking of <pause dur="short"/> you know when you have a problem you always think there is a way round his <pause dur="short"/> there is a way I've just got to find it <pause dur="short"/> and I was sat thinking there isn't one <pause dur="short"/> there's actually nothing I can do</u>
<u n="39" who="S0086"><unclear/> at this point <pause dur="short"/> this and it's all down to the hands of other people <pause dur="short"/> it's just that butterfly effect isn't it? Like if you had if you'd been on an <trunc>eig</trunc> an eight AM shift rather than a ten AM shift you know <pause dur="short"/> if the bus driver had stopped if you'd gone a slightly different route you know and all of those things</u>
<u n="40" who="S0041">if the GP had said keep off your feet</u>
<u n="41" who="S0086">yeah don't go swimming</u>
<u n="42" who="S0041">did I tell you I've got two haematomas</u>
<u n="43" who="S0086">yeah oh well I was there when they said <unclear/> leg <pause dur="short"/> cos actually there's a mark of the bar isn't there? Isn't there like a straight line on your leg? Well that's <pause dur="short"/> it's just mad like how it can have such an effect</u>
<u n="44" who="S0041">yeah just one thing just spirals <pause dur="short"/> I was speaking to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she was like I can't believe this is what you've got to accept <pause dur="short"/> I can't believe that that's the option <pause dur="short"/> there's got to be a way round it <pause dur="short"/> we've tried everything <pause dur="short"/> her Chris and I were all googling ways to do it I said do you know what if I knew a doctor and I thought <pause dur="short"/> I know every profession through uni <pause dur="short"/> I know lawyers I know opticians I know all sorts I know one of everything <pause dur="short"/> coders stupid computer people <pause dur="short"/> anything <pause dur="short"/> I don't know a doctor <pause dur="short"/> I don't know a surgeon</u>
<u n="45" who="S0086">I don't know a <trunc>d</trunc> do I know a doctor? Not that I could call up <pause dur="short"/> I mean I went on a few dates with a guy a <trunc>fe</trunc> two years ago <pause dur="short"/> don't think that really counts unfortunately</u>
<u n="46" who="S0041">Cos I said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you know they said six weeks if they cut it open <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said that's bullshit <pause dur="short"/> six weeks in a C section cutting half your abdomen open</u>
<u n="47" who="S0086">really</u>
<u n="48" who="S0041">she said I'm telling you know if they cut that open say two inches three inches we're talking a week <pause dur="short"/> if you took the week off work kept your leg up you're talking a week and you'll be good to go</u>
<u n="49" who="S0086">well yeah cos when I had my knee cut open and it was all like that <pause dur="short"/> it probably was about ten days before I could walk on it <pause dur="short"/> and that was twenty stitches so <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0041">we're talking six stitches if that</u>
<u n="51" who="S0086">yeah and that's if they do all of it</u>
<u n="52" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0086">it shouldn't be <pause dur="short"/> even if they had to scalpel it open say it's like that big <pause dur="short"/> they only scalpel off a little bit at the top and squeeze it out wouldn't they?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0086">how are they going to get it out are they just going to <unclear/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0041">they literally just scoop it out</u>
<u n="57" who="S0086">scoop what?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0041">okay cos they say they can't needle it because it's congealed <pause dur="short"/> what if they can? Cos there's something really squidgy <pause dur="short"/> there's not all of it congealed <pause dur="short"/> what if they vacuum it out with a syringe get most of it out? <trunc>Se</trunc> my body gets rid of the rest <pause dur="short"/> because as long as it's not this big heavy mass and all that's needed is the pulverised veins in there</u>
<u n="59" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0041">that's basically do my body's work for it</u>
<u n="61" who="S0086">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean I think they probably just want to get rid of it all or nothing because I suppose you would run the risk then of it <pause dur="short"/> a you open it so if you then train it could be in a bit of trouble <pause dur="short"/> also it might just fill it with blood again because there's still a pouch so <pause dur="short"/> did you speak to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> about whether he's got em private health insurance?</u>
<u n="62" who="S0041">no he's in shit in the divorce thing <pause dur="short"/> I just didn't want to</u>
<u n="63" who="S0086">is that actually is that this week or is it next week?</u>
<u n="64" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's this week</u>
<u n="65" who="S0086">this coming  This coming  week</u>
<u n="66" who="S0041" trans="overlap">they've had it <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0086">they've had it? How was it?</u>
<u n="68" who="S0041">she was a douche <pause dur="short"/> she didn't even say hi to him</u>
<u n="69" who="S0086">really?</u>
<u n="70" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> had the gumption to say let's have half the divorce now and half the divorce when your invitation money comes through <pause dur="short"/> and she was so badly behaved during the hearing the judge actually said I think you'll find the compensation is in order because of pain and suffering to one person <pause dur="short"/> and quite frankly <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> I don't see any pain of suffering that has come your way the past thirty years <pause dur="short"/> so no we won't be doing that</u>
<u n="71" who="S0086">wow</u>
<u n="72" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0086">she must have really pissed him off <pause dur="short"/> well they must have just seen her for her true colours <pause dur="short"/> she's out there for money she's not upset because she thinks it's her right to have it <pause dur="short"/> means that she does but it's not <pause dur="short"/> she's not entitled to that money just because she happened to be married to him <pause dur="short"/> there's no love there it sounds like</u>
<u n="74" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="75" who="S0086">she's just out for his money</u>
<u n="76" who="S0041">and the whole time both only solicitors are supposed to speak and she was writing post it notes and wittering and whacking them in front of the solicitors face and really showing herself up and my dad just said the judge was paying him more attention than her completely blanking her and my dad didn't say anything</u>
<u n="77" who="S0086">right</u>
<u n="78" who="S0041">but just because he must have been so fucked off with the way she was behaving <pause dur="short"/> and I said well if you think about it she's used to dealing with people that aren't as bright as her <pause dur="short"/> so the judge has seen her a billion times over <pause dur="short"/> gold-diggers come every week to him</u>
<u n="79" who="S0086">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="80" who="S0041">spot them a mile off</u>
<u n="81" who="S0086">well he's got to make a judgement call hasn't he? On the very small amount of time that he gets to spend with the people in front of him and the evidence he's got to make a call on who these people are <pause dur="short"/> and as you say he's seen that character a hundred time before so <pause dur="short"/> ah man <pause dur="short"/> well that's that's the start of it though</u>
<u n="82" who="S0086" trans="overlap">so <pause dur="short"/> at least my dad's happy</u>
<u n="83" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> my dad's quite happy because it's a good judge <pause dur="short"/> basically they go away now <pause dur="short"/> they've got to answer loads of questions <pause dur="short"/> but mum's got to go and be see a consultant about her life expectancy <pause dur="short"/> so in the next hearing she's got to prove her life expectancy <pause dur="short"/> my dad thinks it's three years</u>
<u n="84" who="S0086">oh really?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0041">but we don't know how much of that is lies from her so she's going to have to prove it <pause dur="short"/> because if it's three years there's no way they're just going to order a <trunc>propor</trunc> a proportion of his pension because she'll only be able to claim it for three years and then it's going to go back on to the <unclear/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0086">into the state yeah</u>
<u n="87" who="S0041">the state yeah <pause dur="short"/> so yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0086">shit three years though <pause dur="short"/> that's going to be fucking weird if that's the case</u>
<u n="89" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well her mother my grandma only made it to sixty-six and wasn't ill <pause dur="short"/> my mum's sixty this year <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> considering how ill she's been <pause dur="short"/> if it's been truthful <pause dur="short"/> if she's not been messing on <pause dur="short"/> then they reckon it's three years</u>
<u n="90" who="S0086">it's difficult to know with her isn't it?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0041">difficult to know whether she's lying or not yeah <pause dur="short"/> but she'll have to prove it in writing now</u>
<u n="92" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0041">so</u>
<u n="94" who="S0086">shitting hell <pause dur="short"/> you're family eh</u>
<u n="95" who="S0041">fucking nutters aren't they? The lot of them</u>
<u n="96" who="S0086">but the thing is it's for you like there's no sort of relief <pause dur="short"/> there's no let up <pause dur="short"/> I mean obviously you've got <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> which is quite nice but she's obviously been unwell as well and you don't want to burden her with your problems <pause dur="short"/> even though I know she would want you to <pause dur="short"/> to go to her because you don't have mum and dad at the moment</u>
<u n="97" who="S0041">she wants me to move back in with her</u>
<u n="98" who="S0086">does she?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos I told her about work and she said you can't <pause dur="short"/> you know if this is if this navy thing is going to be next May you can't stay <unclear/> You can't stay living hand to mouth all the time and looking after your bank account <pause dur="short"/> so I'm going to start applying for new jobs but she said apply as far as <anon type="place"/> cos I'd rather you just come and live with me <pause dur="short"/> she said if you want to go and stay you can go and stay with us you can go and stay with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> for the weekend <pause dur="short"/> and just stay with me during the week</u>
<u n="100" who="S0086">yeah that's it</u>
<u n="101" who="S0041">so <pause dur="short"/> and yeah I prefer not to do that cos that <pause dur="short"/> I prefer to just have my independence but</u>
<u n="102" who="S0086">well if needs must I mean if that's if you really can't stand the job <pause dur="short"/> like the thing is with this is that you thought there was an end light at the end of the tunnel <pause dur="short"/> like you're gearing up come the summer that's it I'm gone from the hotel it's gonna be good I'm going to start my new career <pause dur="short"/> now all that's toppling down a little bit <pause dur="short"/> not saying it's over</u>
<u n="103" who="S0041">yeah to a whole year from now</u>
<u n="104" who="S0086">to this time next year yeah <pause dur="short"/> and really if you've already been telling yourself it's pokey it's shit now but you know I'm going to out soon <pause dur="short"/> to then have to think could I do it for <trunc>a</trunc> another twelve months and really not just for your own sanity but financially it's not viable</u>
<u n="105" who="S0041">financially it's impossible yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0086">but that's not to say that there aren't marketing jobs or language jobs out there <pause dur="short"/> you know particularly over the summer if you think ah I'll just get a job for the summer you know teaching in a language school or something like that <pause dur="short"/> I don't see why that would be a problem <pause dur="short"/> and then you need to find something from September <pause dur="short"/> so just something that's a bit interesting</u>
<u n="107" who="S0041">I mean <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was working with her and was bar tending in the bar of the local pub like <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't pay board she said I wouldn't take rent from you because I'll pay the mortgage whether you're there or not <pause dur="short"/> she said obviously I'd put something towards food and electricity and that <pause dur="short"/> I said yeah but it's not the five hundred pound a month is it? She said oh no nowhere near <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="108" who="S0086">well that would be pretty nice and then at least you can concentrate on getting yourself fit</u>
<u n="109" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="110" who="S0086">Peterborough is quite far</u>
<u n="111" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0086">but you know I'll still be here <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> will still be here you know he'll be here <pause dur="short"/> you've got places to stay <pause dur="short"/> I mean Emily has got a spare room hasn't she? Hasn't she got two bedrooms?</u>
<u n="113" who="S0041">no one bedroom <pause dur="short"/> she's got enough space though</u>
<u n="114" who="S0086">you know there's always going to be people that you can stay with if you come back to visit so <pause dur="short"/> that's not a problem <pause dur="short"/> I was planning to go to Japan on Friday night <pause dur="short"/> I had it all laid out <pause dur="short"/> talking to my friend in the pub on Friday and I was just like yeah that's it I'm going <pause dur="short"/> to Japan <pause dur="short"/> but then no but I'm not going to Japan because of the <pause dur="short"/> I'd forgotten about the radiation</u>
<u n="115" who="S0046">can you turn that off?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0046">I thought you were turning it off</u>
<u n="118" who="S0041">you'd forgotten about the radiation?</u>

<u n="122" who="S0046">no help yourself <pause dur="short"/> it's alright <unclear/> ankle <pause dur="short"/> left one</u>
<u n="123" who="S0086">what have you done?</u>

<u n="1192" who="S0086">wow that's really interesting</u>

<u n="1206" who="S0041">em but they don't have an officer in that division because they're quite mobile they just pop them anywhere <pause dur="short"/> and she said they're basically trying to melt down CTs to merge the CT and the CS which is slightly lower than what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> does job as one job and bring in em an intelligence officer</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0086">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0041">so she said if you go as em a warfare officer then you could you know if you decide after a couple of years it's not what you enjoy <vocal desc="sneeze"/></u>
<u n="1209" who="S0086">bless you</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0041">thank you <pause dur="short"/> you could merge over because that's the way it's going <vocal desc="sneeze"/> to be em as an intelligence officer <pause dur="short"/> and what they do is they they're the people that know all the languages <pause dur="short"/> all of the languages</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0086">all of those languages</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0041">and they said it doesn't matter how many languages you know because they give you an exam <pause dur="short"/> and they've had people go in with a masters that speak six languages and they can't pass the test</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0086">oh my God</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0041">yeah and I was like how? <vocal desc="sneeze"/></u>
<u n="1215" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">bless you</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0041">that's me washing those things a million times</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0086">is it?</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0041">yeah I can smell it?</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0086">allergies?</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0041">em <pause dur="short"/> she said basically they'll they'll test your brain on how capable you are to learn a language <pause dur="short"/> she said cos if you're good at writing you're good at grammar you're good at remembering <pause dur="short"/> that's not what we need <pause dur="short"/> I said good cos that's not what I'm good at <pause dur="short"/> I don't know any of that shit I'm just good at ear wigging <pause dur="short"/> and she's like oh well what we do is we give you a fake model language test <pause dur="short"/> a fake watch now it's basically language that they've made up within the forces <pause dur="short"/> no one knows it and you can never learn it cos it's not real <pause dur="short"/> em and they give you a passage to listen to a passage to read and test you on it <pause dur="short"/> it's completely fabricated</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0086">A made up language</u>
<u n="1222" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">yeah but as soon as you're in you you get the lingo like <pause dur="short"/> when the squaddies come into my work cos obviously I used to go to army bases when I was in cadets you catch onto the lingo and <unclear/></u>
<u n="1223" who="S0041">no but this is a fake thing</u>
<u n="1224" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">like a boot neck is a royal marine</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0041">but I'm not talking kind of slang <pause dur="short"/> I'm talking all three forces have sat down and created an entire language like they have a dictionary for it but it's fake <pause dur="short"/> none of its real <pause dur="short"/> none of it relates to either a Latin language or a Germanic language <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't have any root whatsoever</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0086" trans="overlap">slang <pause dur="short"/> but it's just in order to test your comprehension</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0041">yes so what they do is they work out whether your brain can latch on to how a language I structured basically <pause dur="short"/> so Latin language is structured differently to Germanics languages <pause dur="short"/> but I mean I know <unclear/> and I've never learnt it but just because I can see how it's made up <pause dur="short"/> and so they test you on it <pause dur="short"/> you've got no chance of revising because it's fake <pause dur="short"/> but it tests how your brain could latch on to it <pause dur="short"/> and she said I've had people come in that have masters and they can't get it <pause dur="short"/> they can't get it they fail it it's not a mark it's a pass or fail <pause dur="short"/> but the guy that they've got that just passed it at the moment is some guy some scouser <pause dur="short"/> left school after GSCE <pause dur="short"/> he speaks eleven languages seven fluently</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0086">shit <pause dur="short"/> how did he learn them all?</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> he just did it in his spare time cos his brain is made to that <pause dur="short"/> so she said you know  you know  after a couple of years <unclear/> will have moved over you can sit the test <pause dur="short"/> there's no raising but you could just fail it we don't know</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0086">so you do it when you're in there then?</u>
<u n="1231" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1232" who="S0086">you don't do it as</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0041">it's not that post hasn't been made yet <pause dur="short"/> it's going to take a couple of years for them to move the CTs over to the CSs and merge as one role</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0086">well that's good then <pause dur="short"/> so you go in as warfare but no you could be doing something that's a bit more useful for you languages <pause dur="short"/> well that's good</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0041">and she said you know if you fail it you fail it like it doesn't matter <pause dur="short"/> but yeah how weird is that</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0086">very weird</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0041">I was like fake language test <pause dur="short"/> I said I'm really excited I want to try it</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0086" trans="overlap">I had no idea <unclear/> a fake language</u>
<u n="1239" who="S0041">yeah I was like I really want to try it <pause dur="short"/> I said do you think I can get it online and pretend <pause dur="short"/> and she was like no</u>
<u n="1240" who="S0086">well that would sort of negate the test</u>
<u n="1241" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1242" who="S0086">I thought you meant like it was a fake test like they got it from school or something but actually like it's like a fake language</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> how mental is that?</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0086">that's a lot of time and effort to go to isn't it? To create a fake language</u>
<u n="1245" who="S0041">yeah but to a language person <pause dur="short"/> like I told <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and he was like fuck I want to go <pause dur="short"/> I was like yeah I really want to go too <pause dur="short"/> cos it would be really like exciting to see if your brain could do it cos you don't get a choice <pause dur="short"/> there's no way you can train your brain to do it <pause dur="short"/> it just either can or it can't</u>
<u n="1246" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0041">and I think  I think  I could do it and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> couldn't</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0086">Cos <unclear/> learner of language so one of you can do it</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0041" trans="overlap">the way you learn it</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos like when we moved to places abroad</u>
<u n="1252" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="1253" who="S0041">I couldn't reply cos I couldn't I never studied properly but I could understand everything they is a <pause dur="short"/> so we used to stand there and I'd listen to everything <pause dur="short"/> I could say in English my name is in Italian my name is and the number two <pause dur="short"/> obviously really went to all my classes</u>
<u n="1254" who="S0086">totally did yeah</u>
<u n="1255" who="S0041">all of them <pause dur="short"/> so we'd stand there and for three month I listened to everyone told him what they were saying in English and he replied in Italian cos he could study and remember it</u>
<u n="1256" who="S0086">that's weird isn't it?</u>
<u n="1257" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and my friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because I know her because she came over the year before to our university in Hull as a teacher of languages <pause dur="short"/> she was a student but that's what you do do the exchange <pause dur="short"/> so we went back over to see her <pause dur="short"/> and she did say to me <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> fuck like you're screwed <pause dur="short"/> you never came to any of my classes <pause dur="short"/> what are you going to do? But I stood there and understood everything and relayed it to him and then he's reply in Italian <pause dur="short"/> I'd no idea what the fuck he was saying couldn't work it out but</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0086">and that's the thing cos even when you they make you do your oral test all you basically do is learn a passage</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0041">mm hm</u>
<u n="1260" who="S0086">that's what we did for my German exam</u>
<u n="1261" who="S0041">that's all I did <pause dur="short"/> so all my written exams I did I'd written an essay spent years going through the dictionary <pause dur="short"/> I remembered it off my heart <pause dur="short"/> couldn't write in now</u>
