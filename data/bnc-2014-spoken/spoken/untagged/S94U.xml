<u n="20" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0618">and I suppose we're a little bit off the beaten track and by the windows and the general appearance of the place from outside you do really need to stick your head in the door to know what they do</u>

<u n="240" who="S0618">yeah I've noticed that it seems to be reasonable quality though</u>
<u n="241" who="S0619">I think it's fine</u>
<u n="242" who="S0618">yeah I mean mine goes through a Brita filter because it's just so bloody limescaley but in well actually I suppose in terms of you know quality of drinking water it's not like in Northern Ireland it was pretty much <trunc>o</trunc> run off the mountains</u>
<u n="243" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="244" who="S0618">and the water you could taste the quality it was beautiful it didn't have fluoride or chlorine or loads of chemical shit pumped through it like you get in England erm Cambridge because there are absolutely no hills erm</u>
<u n="245" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="246" who="S0618">every glass of water you drink has already been pissed seven times</u>
<u n="247" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="248" who="S0618">so and it's full of chemicals it's full of fluoride it's really shit water</u>
<u n="249" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah it's the same where I live you can just taste metal <pause dur="short"/> you can taste</u>
<u n="250" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but haven't you've got hills up your way?</u>

<u n="252" who="S0618">you've got loads of rain</u>
<u n="253" who="S0619">and we've got loads of rain and loads of you know</u>
<u n="254" who="S0618">so why does it need to be treated with such nastiness?</u>
<u n="255" who="S0619" trans="overlap">but it's not very nice yeah I sort of think er and so they were like blind testing water from different parts of the country</u>
<u n="256" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="257" who="S0618">er you know what could you taste and is it different which is your favourite? and the best water in England is in the northeast around Northumberland</u>
<u n="258" who="S0618">ah <pause dur="short"/> near the hills again</u>
<u n="259" who="S0619">yeah because it's quite hilly</u>
<u n="260" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="261" who="S0619">but</u>
<u n="262" who="S0618">Northern Ireland was just so nice so nice it had a slightly nutty taste to my taste buds but I could almost smell the goodness on it</u>
<u n="263" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> mm hm</u>
<u n="264" who="S0618">it was just incredibly good water incredibly good and Cambridge I don't like drinking it but then I refuse to buy plastic petrochemical</u>
<u n="265" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah I don't like buying bottled water</u>
<u n="266" who="S0618">bottled stuff</u>
<u n="267" who="S0619">erm but you know it's funny if you ask people here</u>
<u n="268" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="269" who="S0619">you know what's your favourite brand of water?</u>
<u n="270" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="271" who="S0619">they've all got an opinion</u>
<u n="272" who="S0618" trans="overlap">everybody's got an opinion I know I noticed that that you know very soon after arriving I asked for some tap water in a restaurant and they looked at me like I was from another planet and said no we don't do that would you like a bottle? well no why would I want</u>
<u n="273" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm mm hm</u>
<u n="274" who="S0618">a bottle? it just seems completely nonsensical</u>
<u n="275" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="276" who="S0618">and</u>
<u n="277" who="S0619" trans="overlap">I buy water for the bottle <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="278" who="S0618">no</u>
<u n="279" who="S0619">but they need to probably get a better system</u>
<u n="280" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah part of my degree was on water and they talk about it being liquid gold and the new oil</u>
<u n="281" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="282" who="S0618">because I imagine free energy will be available and oil will be redundant in the coming decade or perhaps two erm but water is gonna be the resource already wars over water erm</u>
<u n="283" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="284" who="S0618">erm and still wars over oil but those will be coming to a close but yeah wars over water that's erm hopefully gonna get knocked on the head I mean again as technology has developed and free energy should allow for free desalination so everybody should be able to access free water</u>
<u n="285" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="286" who="S0618">but I suppose what's made a difference is you know Pepsi Coke Nestle Danone all of those that have made this massive industry by convincing people that tap water is poor quality</u>
<u n="287" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="288" who="S0618">so they sell you water which is also tap water</u>
<u n="289" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="290" who="S0618">in a plastic bottle</u>
<u n="291" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah unbelievable</u>
<u n="292" who="S0618">and pretending it's something health-giving <pause dur="short"/> it's interesting the psychology behind it all of it and erm</u>
<u n="293" who="S0619">if you look on some of the bottles in the supermarkets here</u>
<u n="294" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="295" who="S0619">erm I can't read what it says obviously but on some there's you know like a picture of erm a mum and a child or a pregnant woman as though this water is specially formulated</u>
<u n="296" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah yeah pregnant women</u>
<u n="297" who="S0619">for pregnant women</u>

<u n="299" who="S0619">what? why or how?</u>
<u n="300" who="S0618">probably be better off with a bottle of Guinness <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="301" who="S0619">just <unclear/> anyway an interesting thing I was listening to on Woman's Hour this morning which was erm <pause dur="short"/> should parents swear in front of their children or deliberately try not to swear in front of their children? and for that I've never really thought about it</u>
<u n="302" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm so again I prickle at all of the should or must words</u>
<u n="303" who="S0619" trans="overlap">aha aha</u>

<u n="306" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="307" who="S0619">what are the advantages and disadvantages then? if you want it in a sort of CELTA form</u>
<u n="308" who="S0618">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="309" who="S0619">what are the drawbacks and benefits</u>

<u n="312" who="S0618" trans="overlap">do you agree or disagree?</u>
<u n="313" who="S0619" trans="overlap">er and <unclear/></u>
<u n="314" who="S0618">give reasons</u>

<u n="317" who="S0619">erm</u>
<u n="318" who="S0618">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's interesting isn't it? erm swearing mm <pause dur="short"/> my dad never swore and he was my main influence growing up as my mother left when I was six erm I remember my mum swearing my dad never swore my brother who is nine and a half years older swore all the time</u>
<u n="319" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="320" who="S0618">and still does actually he's not he doesn't swear as much as he used to erm <pause dur="short"/> for me it depends on who I'm with I swear more around you</u>
<u n="321" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="322" who="S0618">erm <pause dur="short"/> I swear actually pretty much never around my dad <pause dur="short"/> I don't know I think swearing it's interesting it can be used for emphasis or to add colour to a</u>
<u n="323" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="324" who="S0618">or depth or texture to a conversation</u>
<u n="325" who="S0619" trans="overlap">I think it's incredibly er patronising</u>
<u n="326" who="S0618" trans="overlap">it has its place</u>
<u n="327" who="S0619">when people say if you swear a lot it's because you don't have a very good vocabulary</u>
<u n="328" who="S0618">bollocks</u>
<u n="329" who="S0619">I think that's complete bollocks I have an excellent vocabulary erm but it er it is more <pause dur="short"/> emphasis and stress and it's lots of sort of really positive reasons it's a</u>
<u n="330" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="331" who="S0619">part of language as well as anything else</u>
<u n="332" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="333" who="S0619">er it shows evolution in language it shows where the same words have been used for hundreds of years erm <pause dur="short"/> which is really interesting erm my dad hasn't started swearing in front of me until I was sort of in my early twenties and even now I'm like oh whereas my mum has never swore at me but I think she just doesn't swear anyway</u>
<u n="334" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="360" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="361" who="S0619">because I know that sex is wrong</u>

<u n="364" who="S0618">yeah</u>

<u n="373" who="S0619">but no it says</u>
<u n="374" who="S0618" trans="overlap">that is really interesting and I wonder you know thinking about me personally as well I do feel there's a bit of a gender issue there as well and my generation certainly older I would say it was predominantly men and predominantly working class men</u>
<u n="375" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="376" who="S0618">that swore</u>
<u n="377" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>

<u n="379" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="380" who="S0618">and I think those boundaries have pretty much dissolved for this generation</u>

<u n="391" who="S0618">like a normal person exactly yeah</u>
<u n="392" who="S0619">er but it was only sort of a couple of them er and I think that said a lot about the sort of mm girls that they knew or the girls</u>
<u n="393" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="394" who="S0619">that they hung around with or you know their views and stuff rather than the sort of <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>prob</trunc>problems with me necessarily but I was always really offended by these people</u>

<u n="402" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think the line is really blurry</u>
<u n="403" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="404" who="S0619">but it is a combination of both of those things</u>
<u n="405" who="S0618">very possibly</u>
<u n="406" who="S0619">erm I think it's done with good intentions but it's coming from a bad place</u>
<u n="407" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="408" who="S0619">erm but on this er programme there were two mums and one said I swear all the time in front of my kids <unclear/> we said sort of deliberately we won't stop</u>
<u n="409" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="410" who="S0619">we're not gonna swear at our children but we won't stop ourselves from swearing where we would naturally and the other one said no never er ever at all we've cut it out completely and then they were talking about the impact on the kids and <trunc>ho</trunc> on how these kids with the mum who or the parents who never swear you know sort of gasp if they hear it on the TV</u>
<u n="411" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="412" who="S0619">or you know it's funny if people talk about it in the playground</u>
<u n="413" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="414" who="S0619">and the others they just don't bat an eyelid and they don't have <trunc>a</trunc> they know that it's er offensive language and</u>

<u n="420" who="S0619">erm</u>
<u n="421" who="S0618">I wonder if that was the key thing because you know with with swearing of course it is a part of language but there are situations where it's more or less appropriate</u>
<u n="422" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="423" who="S0618" trans="overlap">a bit like any form of language so</u>
<u n="424" who="S0619" trans="overlap">I think a lot of people yeah</u>
<u n="425" who="S0618" trans="overlap">you need to yeah be educating a child as to you know appropriate use of it I guess</u>
<u n="426" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah I think a lot of people think kids are kind of <pause dur="short"/> er kids are stupid or they won't understand something and they level everything so low</u>

<u n="437" who="S0619">mouth's in the gutter and all this stuff erm <pause dur="short"/> you know and I think <pause dur="short"/> explaining it</u>
<u n="438" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="439" who="S0619">sort of teaching it as well as any other sort thing rather than saying this is taboo</u>
