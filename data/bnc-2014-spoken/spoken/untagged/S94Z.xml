<u n="1" who="S0561">well it's yeah</u>
<u n="2" who="S0640">that's</u>
<u n="3" who="S0561">actually twenty</u>
<u n="4" who="S0640" trans="overlap">that's</u>
<u n="5" who="S0561">doesn't begin to probably closer to forty by the time they've left</u>
<u n="6" who="S0566">well if nothing else if that was paid off it does mean that they're not having to pay it off</u>
<u n="7" who="S0640">oh yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0566">so they gain</u>
<u n="9" who="S0561" trans="overlap">I know what you're saying about</u>
<u n="10" who="S0566" trans="overlap">immediately</u>
<u n="11" who="S0561">yeah ultimately we would lose out of <trunc>eigh</trunc> somebody would <trunc>lo</trunc> we would financially lose out but at the same time that takes that black cloud from over their head</u>
<u n="12" who="S0640">yeah I just said purely financially I accept</u>
<u n="13" who="S0561" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0640">you know there's an emotional thing so it's</u>
<u n="15" who="S0561" trans="overlap">and you know I couldn't give them enough to set them up for life</u>
<u n="16" who="S0640">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0561">so <pause dur="short"/> if I if I could do that then oh I'll pay it all off</u>
<u n="18" who="S0640">yeah yeah well</u>
<u n="19" who="S0561">but all I'm doing is is taking a black cloud from over their head cos let's be honest it's well I mean if <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> didn't but if had <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> stayed on we worked out that they'd be starting their life after</u>
<u n="20" who="S0640">mm</u>
<u n="21" who="S0561">it was like <trunc>eigh</trunc> nearly eighty grand's worth of debt well you just if you can get that off from above your head</u>
<u n="22" who="S0640">but it to some degree it is meaningless debt they will never pay back eighty grand</u>
<u n="23" who="S0561">no</u>
<u n="24" who="S0564">surely that affects</u>
<u n="25" who="S0640" trans="overlap">they will pay back a chunk</u>
<u n="26" who="S0564" trans="overlap">if you're going to go get try and get a mortgage or something like that?</u>
<u n="27" who="S0640">yeah they they're better off doing a deposit for the mortgage or even part ownership of the house</u>
<u n="28" who="S0564">yeah but I mean the</u>
<u n="29" who="S0640">that in your will bequeath it to them so there's no way</u>
<u n="30" who="S0561" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0640">they they will ever actually have to part own it with you</u>
<u n="32" who="S0561">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0640">erm <pause dur="short"/> well <trunc>i</trunc>it wasn't for you know students' loans <unclear/> students' loans but one of the things I think it was <pause dur="short"/> either Peter Jones or Richard Branson said if they don't give their children any money what they'll do is they pay their their tax bill <pause dur="short"/> so if they earn nothing the kids get nothing <pause dur="short"/> but for every extra pound they earn they actually earn an extra pound whereas for us cos we</u>
<u n="34" who="S0561" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0640">no one pays our tax bill we earn an extra pound and we only earn seventy-five P and then we get to the threshold and then we actually only earn sixty P <pause dur="short"/> you know erm and</u>
<u n="36" who="S0561">yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0640">I feel that's quite a nice way of doing it</u>
<u n="38" who="S0561">mm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0640">cos it still shows them the value of money</u>
<u n="40" who="S0543"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0640">it's not a big <unclear>dole out</unclear> quickly</u>
<u n="42" who="S0561">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0640">whether they would truly appreciate it is a separate question but <pause dur="short"/> but you could if you were to win the lottery <pause dur="short"/> erm that would be another option is to offer to always what part of their salary they're losing to a student loan so you've essentially taken that burden away from them</u>
<u n="44" who="S0561">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="45" who="S0566">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0561">it's a bit hypothetical <pause dur="short"/> we've <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I have said those really not quite yet cos we're still supporting these but really once you two have graduated with first class honours</u>
<u n="47" who="S0566"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="48" who="S0640">from Oxford for your doctorate</u>
<u n="49" who="S0561"><vocal desc="laugh"/> erm</u>
<u n="50" who="S0566"><unclear>or a second will do</unclear></u>
<u n="51" who="S0561" trans="overlap">really we need to go and see a financial advisor cos we're not making the most of our money</u>
<u n="52" who="S0543" trans="overlap">that's what I'm aiming for</u>
<u n="53" who="S0561">we really need advice on what even if just for a few years before we retire we could make it work so well it's not working for us at all at the moment <pause dur="short"/> really need advice on what to do with it</u>
<u n="54" who="S0640">yeah and if you're gonna do that you need to <trunc>thi</trunc> sit down and think for yourself about what your attitude to risk is and things <pause dur="short"/> cos I know you're very not very but you're quite anti risk aren't you?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0566">yeah</u>
<u n="56" who="S0640">you're averse to shares</u>
<u n="57" who="S0566" trans="overlap">I play I play safe</u>
<u n="58" who="S0640">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0566" trans="overlap">tend to be fairly</u>
<u n="60" who="S0640" trans="overlap">erm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0566">safe</u>
<u n="62" who="S0640" trans="overlap">and that's fine but you're</u>
<u n="63" who="S0566" trans="overlap">and <trunc>t</trunc>touch wood it's actually worked for me in many ways but I probably could have done better</u>
<u n="64" who="S0640">yeah but</u>
<u n="65" who="S0566" trans="overlap">if I'd taken more risk</u>
<u n="66" who="S0561">but if you're doing well enough and you feel safe then</u>
<u n="67" who="S0640">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0564">well if you take a risk and you lose your money</u>
<u n="69" who="S0566">well that's right yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0640" trans="overlap">it's again it's not just about cos <trunc>mon</trunc>money the concept of money is it's an abstract concept as a proxy for almost anything else it's a proxy for retiring earlier <pause dur="short"/> it's a proxy for working shorter hours it's a proxy for</u>
<u n="71" who="S0543" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0640">taking better holidays so it still might be that yes you you know you're happy with what you've done but it might be if you wanted nicer holidays</u>
<u n="73" who="S0566">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0640">you could have invested more riskily</u>
<u n="75" who="S0566">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0640">I'm not pushing you down a risk thing but that is the very first question a financial advisor will ask you</u>
<u n="77" who="S0564" trans="overlap">I <unclear/> taking a risk</u>
<event desc="begin overlap"/>
<u n="78" who="S0543"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="79" who="S0639"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="80" who="S0543">oh the other one's best</u>
<event desc="end overlap"/>
<u n="81" who="S0566">it's getting the balance right I have got some stocks and shares and Isas which were up there they're down here at the moment</u>
<u n="82" who="S0561">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0566">but they're starting to go up again so I'm leaving them there and eventually they'll go <unclear/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0561" trans="overlap"><unclear/> they've got some safe and some</u>
<u n="85" who="S0566">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0561">not high risk</u>
<u n="87" who="S0640" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">I think this is the kind of <unclear/></u>
<u n="88" who="S0561" trans="overlap">but more medium risk</u>
<u n="89" who="S0566">my share of of stocks and shares is fairly small compared with other investment</u>
<u n="90" who="S0561">mm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0566">but I try and push other investments around to get the best I can</u>
<u n="92" who="S0561">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0566">like the erm the <anon type="place"/> bonds the first year was a nice nice return if I just leave it to renew the return has dropped quite a bit so I'm cashing it in I'm gonna move it somewhere else</u>
<u n="94" who="S0561">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0566">to try and get a better return so that's the way I</u>
<u n="96" who="S0561" trans="overlap">but this er you've gotta say on top of it as well if you we to a financial advisor and he says do this this and this <pause dur="short"/> and then we see back er sit back and lose leave it we'll probably lose out you've got to keep revisiting haven't you?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0640">it only needs an hour every quarter</u>
<u n="98" who="S0566"><trunc>s</trunc>someone <trunc>s</trunc> one said that if you spend an hour working on your finances and you're twenty pounds better off you've just earned a wage of twenty pounds an hour</u>
<u n="99" who="S0561">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0566">people forget that that</u>
<u n="101" who="S0640">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0566" trans="overlap">that you know they spend an hour where oh I can't be bothered doing this I'm only earning but actually you go to work and you'd be glad to earn that</u>
<u n="103" who="S0561">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0566">you know spend a bit of time working on it you can earn a lot more than that</u>
<u n="105" who="S0561" trans="overlap">yeah but we'd need help</u>
<u n="106" who="S0640" trans="overlap">well and that's a that's an after tax</u>
<u n="107" who="S0561" trans="overlap">I wouldn't know where to start</u>

<u n="110" who="S0566">yeah it can be yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0561">yeah but we've just sort of said I mean well we're supporting these and things there's outgoings and what have you</u>
<u n="112" who="S0640">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0561">now is not the best time really to</u>
