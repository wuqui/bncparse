<u n="20" who="S0529" trans="overlap">do they know what it is though? cos I'm worried that</u>
<u n="21" who="S0530" trans="overlap">no no no no</u>
<u n="22" who="S0529">I'm worried that they know what it is is the problem</u>
<u n="23" who="S0530">I tell them it's like a writers' blog</u>
<u n="24" who="S0529" trans="overlap">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos</u>
<u n="25" who="S0530">because it's partly true <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0529">yeah well like no that is for you cos you do actually <unclear>do like</unclear> writing <unclear/> no but what happened was like my mum rang me up yesterday and she was like I think you've been on like this you've just been like writing talking to people like on the internet for too long and I was like how what? why would you say something like that? cos she never says stuff like that</u>
<u n="27" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="28" who="S0529">and I kind of was like oh shit do you like know something that you wanna tell me? and then erm we had a bit of a fight so I just like hung up on her</u>
<u n="29" who="S0530">oh my god</u>
<u n="30" who="S0529"><unclear>I know</unclear> <vocal desc="laugh"/> but she didn't like say whether she like found it or not cos I didn't wanna like bring to her attention that I had a blog if she didn't know</u>
<u n="31" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm if she didn't know</u>
<u n="32" who="S0529" trans="overlap">and then just like just find out if she had been on it but she said something that kind of sounded like she might have an inkling and then I wrote that on my blog I wrote like I've gotta hope my mum didn't know about this blog I hope like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> hasn't told her and then my friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> just texted me this morning that I'm gonna be really honest with you me and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like erm wrote a message to your auntie on Facebook like telling her like we're worried about you erm and I got like really angry at that because they know how much I don't like talking about it to my family and they like</u>
<u n="33" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="34" who="S0529">what I tell them in confidence I expect to be kind of kept in confidence</u>
<u n="35" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0529">and I was really quite angry <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0530" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0529">but I said like yeah I get what I get like kinda why you did it but you've just gotta like take this with a pinch of salt like I'm up here you know I'm writing all this stuff when I'm on my own and I do actually have people to talk to like I you know I've got you I've got the college I've got you know like I'm seeing counselling and stuff so they don't need to worry</u>
<u n="39" who="S0530">mm mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0529">and she was like okay that's fine and then and then my other friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> though who's the one who actually wrote the message I'm trying to get in contact with her but she's not replying to me</u>
<u n="41" who="S0530">no</u>
<u n="42" who="S0529">so I don't actually know if she has <unclear/> like she could have done but also I don't think they told her like my address the blog address</u>
<u n="43" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0529">like I I would hope they didn't but</u>
<u n="45" who="S0530" trans="overlap">I'm sure they wouldn't of told her</u>
<u n="46" who="S0529">I know it just seems to be the no <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> apparently said like she just said I have a blog like in the message but I mean my auntie kind of knew I had a blog cos I think I mentioned it but I don't know what they told her like it's really really scary <unclear/> er</u>
<u n="47" who="S0530" trans="overlap">I doubt they would have told her where you're at on your blog or what your URL is</u>
<u n="48" who="S0529" trans="overlap">I know but even so it's <unclear/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0530" trans="overlap">but yeah it's not great</u>
<u n="50" who="S0529">it's really like pissed me off a lot I kind of get why they did it but also I don't get why they did it because they know me and they know that that's like</u>
<u n="51" who="S0530" trans="overlap">your <trunc>spa</trunc></u>
<u n="52" who="S0529"><unclear/> one hundred of things you should not do</u>
<u n="53" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="54" who="S0529">to piss <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> off</u>
<u n="55" who="S0530">I mean if</u>
<u n="56" who="S0529"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="57" who="S0530">if they said I'm worried about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> they could of just said like I just I rang her up and spoke to her and she's not very happy if they had to do it you know what I mean? rather than say er looked on her blog</u>
<u n="58" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0530">like I wouldn't yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0529" trans="overlap">like why didn't they just tell me?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0530">yeah mm</u>
<u n="62" who="S0529" trans="overlap">like why didn't they just say to me like I'm worried about you? because they haven't done that they've just been like like routinely asking if I'm okay</u>
<u n="63" who="S0530" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="64" who="S0529">and then I said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like to be fair would you rather I kind of like unloaded on you like I do on Tumblr every time?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="66" who="S0529">cos that's what <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s been doing about her situation and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s like completely exhausted with it and I said to her like do you really want that? and she was like yeah fair enough like cos I don't mind that I understand that you know not everyone can take it at once and so that's why I kind of like keep my answers short when she's when she's asking me how I am</u>
<u n="67" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0529">cos she looks on my blog anyway and it's just like <vocal desc="sigh"/> that's really annoying me and now I wanna change my URL cos I don't want yeah cos I I mean the ideal situation would be if I could just like delete it completely but <unclear/> do that</u>
<u n="69" who="S0530" trans="overlap">no I don't think you should have to do that</u>
<u n="70" who="S0529">but I don't know if I can do that at the moment like I do think I mean I know it's like really toxic and I am like really dependent on it but <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> uh I don't know I think I have gotten better with it like last year it was way worse than this on Tumblr like I was literally just going on there all the time</u>
<u n="71" who="S0530">mm mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0529">but now I kind of only go on there to re-blog stuff and then if I get messages I'll answer them but I'm making a lot more like a lot less kind of actual like personal posts</u>
<u n="73" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0529">than I used to</u>
<u n="75" who="S0530">definitely</u>
<u n="76" who="S0529">which is kind of an improvement <vocal desc="laugh"/> but I don't think I can actually delete it yet and <unclear/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0530">well you shouldn't you shouldn't feel like you have to like there's nothing wrong with it but</u>
<u n="78" who="S0529" trans="overlap">well no it is <unclear>you know</unclear></u>
<u n="79" who="S0530">there is a point like where maybe it can detract from your real life</u>
<u n="80" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="81" who="S0530">just for your own yeah I mean for me now like I go on it in the evening a little bit</u>
<u n="82" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0530">but I don't go on it during the day really</u>
<u n="84" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0530">which helps cos it's like routine maybe</u>
<u n="86" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0530">I dunno but yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean sometimes the reality like <unclear>if you do</unclear> get addicted to this sort of thing like the lines between real life and Tumblr can kind of get blurred</u>
<u n="88" who="S0529">yeah <unclear/> and like <unclear/> that and</u>
<u n="89" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0529">but yeah like when you're feeling really low you do get wrapped up in it and it's difficult not to</u>
<u n="91" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah definitely cos it's an easy way of expressing yourself really</u>
<u n="92" who="S0529">well exactly that that's what like my argument is like I feel better talking like writing about it than I do actually like</u>
<u n="93" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0529">verbally speaking and <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> oh it's just <unclear/> problems when it's friends <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but she just she shows it to everyone like like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and that</u>
<u n="95" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0529">I get that she's scared and she's worried and stuff but she shows it to her boyfriend er she shows it to her friends and they all know about it and it's just <vocal desc="sigh"/> er like I know it's public but you have to find it like you have to have the name of it to know what what it is</u>
<u n="97" who="S0530">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0529" trans="overlap">and she just gives out the name of it and it's like <vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0530" trans="overlap">that's not that's not right to be honest</u>
<u n="100" who="S0529" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="101" who="S0530">I wouldn't ever give out anybody's Tumblr</u>
<u n="102" who="S0529">no I know like I <vocal desc="sigh"/> like I I erm I sympathise with her because no I empathise with her even like <unclear>cos</unclear> I get <unclear>that she kind of</unclear> doesn't know what to do and her and her boyfriend talk about it a lot but I just I don't really like what she <unclear/></u>
<u n="103" who="S0530">went behind your back and did it yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="sigh"/> well no I'm glad she told me today cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> didn't fucking step up like she hasn't even replied to me and she hasn't gotta read more things so I bet she's read it and just isn't replying <vocal desc="sigh"/> cos I've sent her like five messages <pause dur="short"/> it's really annoying</u>
<u n="105" who="S0530">ah <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="106" who="S0529" trans="overlap">but enough of my stupid dramas</u>
<u n="107" who="S0530">it's not stupid dramas</u>
<u n="108" who="S0529"><unclear/></u>
<u n="109" who="S0530">I get pissed off and anxious when people read my blog that I don't know</u>
<u n="110" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><unclear/> like if my family have read it that is like a massive <vocal desc="laugh"/> like a massive drama</u>
<u n="111" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <trunc>li</trunc>literally I don't mind if my friends read it sometimes</u>

<u n="176" who="S0529">a worldwide thing that anybody can see if they know my <unclear>ID</unclear> <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's quite ridiculous but it feels a lot more personal than a diary <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="177" who="S0530" trans="overlap">if you ever wanted to keep a diary like here would be like the best place ironically</u>
<u n="178" who="S0529" trans="overlap">I know it would yeah <pause dur="short"/> it really would</u>
<u n="179" who="S0530">because like nobody's gonna come here in here and like steal it</u>
