<u n="904" who="S0195">so you get a certain amount of antenatal courses free on the NHS we didn't do those erm we basically paid a hundred and eighty quid for this course</u>
<u n="905" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="906" who="S0195">which I thought was a right rip-off at the time I thought there's no way I <trunc>re</trunc> really didn't wanna do this course at a hundred and eighty quid</u>
<u n="907" who="S0192">what can they teach you?</u>
<u n="908" who="S0195" trans="overlap">well what can they teach you that the NHS one isn't gonna do?</u>

<u n="912" who="S0195"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="913" who="S0192">not much of a compromise is it?</u>

<u n="916" who="S0195">I compromised my position</u>
<u n="917" who="S0192">I bet</u>
<u n="918" who="S0195">but anyway we we went to this course and it was two full Saturdays and one evening and do you know what? this course was absolutely brilliant</u>
<u n="919" who="S0192">oh</u>
<u n="920" who="S0195">it taught me so much yeah I was really ill prepared for and this course it <trunc>w</trunc> it was it was excellent I can recommend it highly enough</u>
<u n="921" who="S0192" trans="overlap">that's good that you recommend it so highly</u>
<u n="922" who="S0195">and if you think it about it actually</u>
<u n="923" who="S0192">are you sure you're not a salesman?</u>
<u n="924" who="S0195">oh yeah no no I <vocal desc="laugh"/> I think if you think about it a hundred and eighty quid for two people to go on a two full day course with one evening</u>
<u n="925" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no it's pretty good</u>
<u n="926" who="S0195">that's a good deal</u>
<u n="927" who="S0192">yeah definitely what kind of things did you learn then?</u>
<u n="928" who="S0195">mm</u>
<u n="929" who="S0192">what kind of wisdom can you pass on cos</u>
<u n="930" who="S0195">we</u>
<u n="931" who="S0192"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I are going to be well screwed by the time we may eventually end up having children</u>
<u n="932" who="S0195">well you'll probably be better off coming back here to have kids wouldn't you anyway?</u>
<u n="933" who="S0192">yeah that's the problem like it complicates the situation quite a lot I've met children that are from families that move around a lot and the the child though</u>
<u n="934" who="S0195" trans="overlap">they're pretty fucked up <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="935" who="S0192">well yeah I mean basically though the child may be on paper more intelligent and you know speaks numerous languages and done these kind of things with regard to social interaction with people in their school or whatever I mean I met a girl that in my in my upper school that was erm a compulsive liar basically</u>
<u n="936" who="S0195">yeah</u>
<u n="937" who="S0192">cos she'd been travelling so much and she'd been around so much people couldn't call <trunc>bull</trunc> call her bullshit</u>
<u n="938" who="S0195">yeah</u>
<u n="939" who="S0192">which she hadn't you know what I mean you haven't been around</u>
<u n="940" who="S0195" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="941" who="S0192">so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I have to take that into consideration if we wanna have children we need to settle down and then we have the problem of well I don't think we're gonna settle down for a little while so <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="942" who="S0195">therefore you won't have kids for a little while</u>
<u n="943" who="S0192">we still wanna do a PhD after we <unclear/></u>
<u n="944" who="S0195" trans="overlap">do you wanna have kids then?</u>
<u n="945" who="S0192">a part of us definitely does like both <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I like to experience things and having a child is a pretty big experience</u>
<u n="946" who="S0195">it's well it's the ultimate one that</u>
<u n="947" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah it's massive</u>
<u n="948" who="S0195" trans="overlap">could obviously</u>
<u n="949" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah and it's a massive experience and nothing else covers it so we've discussed it and we kind of think maybe if we get to like forty I think</u>
<u n="950" who="S0195">wow</u>
<u n="951" who="S0192">another ten years of travelling educating <unclear/></u>
<u n="952" who="S0195" trans="overlap">well the thing is mate forty's too late for a woman these days</u>
<u n="953" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="954" who="S0195">I mean it can be done I mean in our</u>
<u n="955" who="S0192" trans="overlap">my mum had one at forty-seven</u>
<u n="956" who="S0195">well yeah and there was a woman in our NCT class who was forty-four</u>
<u n="957" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="958" who="S0195">er but she'd got artificially inseminated</u>
<u n="959" who="S0192">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="960" who="S0195">so her eggs weren't working so it's someone else's eggs and his sperm</u>
<u n="961" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and this is the problem again when we've added what up what we need to do and then we decide that forty is the perfect age to do it and then realise</u>
<u n="962" who="S0195" trans="overlap">biologically it's not <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="963" who="S0192"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s mum yeah hit hit the menopause at forty-one so you know that stuff can easily happen quite young if you're a woman</u>
<u n="964" who="S0195" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="965" who="S0192">so then I guess we've decided that at that point we may just adopt I think</u>
<u n="966" who="S0195">yeah</u>
<u n="967" who="S0192">erm it would be</u>
<u n="968" who="S0195" trans="overlap">but that's not the same is it though?</u>
<u n="969" who="S0192" trans="overlap">you've got a child that's not the same as you</u>
<u n="970" who="S0195">it's not the same</u>
<u n="971" who="S0192">but if you think about it adoption could be better if you waited and you adopted a child when they were eighteen years old and just about to go to uni and you pay for them to go to uni</u>
<u n="972" who="S0195">yeah</u>
<u n="973" who="S0192">and then</u>
<u n="974" who="S0195">they'd just be like oh cheers mate <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="975" who="S0192">and then you you you basically have an agreement</u>
<u n="976" who="S0195" trans="overlap">mug <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="977" who="S0192">you sign a contract that says I pay for you for uni and for the next ten years and then you pay for me for when I'm like retiring cos we may need help <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="978" who="S0195" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> that's not a very good deal</u>
<u n="979" who="S0192">I think that could be a good</u>
<u n="980" who="S0195" trans="overlap">well for them it's not</u>
<u n="981" who="S0192" trans="overlap">if you set up single people with students around the country that don't have a</u>

<u n="1207" who="S0192">just nattering like mad <pause dur="short"/> the problem was that <trunc>w</trunc> we'd applied to this job about three or four months before so we actually</u>
