<u n="89" who="S0518">but they had ten years to do that</u>
<u n="90" who="S0517">had they sort of expected ten years though?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0518">yeah</u>

<u n="114" who="S0517">the more it spreads the quicker it is I suppose isn't it?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0518" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> thing is if it's got into your lymphatic system isn't it? or</u>
<u n="116" who="S0517" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>

<u n="756" who="S0517">he wants to go on a Saturday morning and referee the little ones <pause dur="short"/> which I assumed was why <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was doing it or is that?</u>

<u n="999" who="S0518">I think what it was is they couldn't <pause dur="short"/> pull apart whether it was <pause dur="short"/> real issues <pause dur="short"/> or <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>h</trunc>health issues or relationship issues <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> health issues they can't deal with unless it's mentally <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>men</trunc> affecting your mental health <pause dur="short"/> so if it's just side effects</u>

<u n="1001" who="S0518" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and on the four sections of questions <pause dur="short"/> two of them <pause dur="short"/> I <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>u</trunc> you know were not a worry but erm anxiety and low moods I scored highly on <pause dur="short"/> because obviously <pause dur="short"/> when I was asked the questions <pause dur="short"/> I was having daily panic attacks <pause dur="short"/> how often do you feel anxious or panicky?</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0517">every day</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0518">every day <pause dur="short"/> so that gives you a high score</u>

<u n="1005" who="S0518">you know? <pause dur="short"/> how often do you feel?</u>

<u n="1007" who="S0518">what?</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0517">you didn't <trunc>y</trunc>you haven't always felt anxious or? <trunc>i</trunc></u>
<u n="1009" who="S0518">no but they ask you it's based on the last two weeks</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0517" trans="overlap">it's <pause dur="short"/> last</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0518">so every time</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0517" trans="overlap">right <pause dur="short"/> but that I mean you've been on the drugs for the last two weeks?</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0518">yeah so</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0517">mm</u>
<u n="1015" who="S0518">when they first asked me the set of questions <pause dur="short"/> they say <pause dur="short"/> only answer how you felt in the last two weeks <pause dur="short"/> don't think back to the past don't think how you've been <pause dur="short"/> previously or whatever <pause dur="short"/> how have you felt?</u>

<u n="1017" who="S0518">during the last two weeks? <pause dur="short"/> and then I think I told you I was <trunc>l</trunc> not a high-risk person because I hadn't <pause dur="short"/> entertained <pause dur="short"/> taking my own life or self-harming or anything that was <pause dur="short"/> not a problem <pause dur="short"/> and then there's a whole series of questions like how much does this affect you? <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> carrying out your social life so are you able to go out and meet people? doesn't affect me at all yes I go out <vocal desc="laugh"/> and meet people I actually feel better for meeting people</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0517">mm</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0518">so all of those questions <pause dur="short"/> I <pause dur="short"/> scored really low on so they're not an issue <pause dur="short"/> but obviously anxiety and low moods because the questions that come up in low moods are <pause dur="short"/> during the course of last fortnight and it it's sort of a choice between erm <pause dur="short"/> never <pause dur="short"/> it ranges between never <trunc>t</trunc></u>

<u n="1023" who="S0518">er all the time how often do you feel erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> as a person <pause dur="short"/> er that you are letting your <trunc>s</trunc> or others down? <pause dur="short"/> so from <pause dur="short"/> every day <pause dur="short"/> because that's how <trunc>s</trunc> you know just being off work I'm letting people down <pause dur="short"/> you know?</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0517">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1025" who="S0518" trans="overlap">every day <pause dur="short"/> so that's why I score highly in those two areas</u>

<u n="1029" who="S0518" trans="overlap">but that's how they have to do it <pause dur="short"/> and so I think because there are all these <trunc>thi</trunc> issues the girl that made the assessment put me through to level three <pause dur="short"/> then <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>I</trunc> I went to meet this woman she's called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and then erm <pause dur="short"/> she's</u>

<u n="1431" who="S0517">mm</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0518">and it's it's <pause dur="short"/> stuff that's happened all goes to shape the person that we are we can't do anything about that because that's happened <pause dur="short"/> but it's when we come up against something that potentially <pause dur="short"/> can <pause dur="short"/> trigger something off <pause dur="short"/> that you pick the right attitude to deal with it</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0517" trans="overlap">yes yeah yeah</u>
