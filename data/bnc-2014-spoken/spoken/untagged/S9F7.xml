<u n="1" who="S0526">I've been a model <trunc>engin</trunc> nothing to do with cataracts I've been a model engineer for nearly thirty years <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I've built three traction engines I'm now doing a railway engine <pause dur="short"/> built a number of stationary engines <pause dur="short"/> workshops been built up over the years <pause dur="short"/> several lathes <pause dur="short"/> different types different milling machines <pause dur="short"/> been a member of the club for <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/> model engineers for nearly thirty years <pause dur="short"/> and I'm here on a working party doing not a lot</u>
<u n="2" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/> so the background noises we can hear are other people working this morning <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> can you tell me? <pause dur="short"/> er all the things you've done <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> over the years <pause dur="short"/> what would you say <pause dur="short"/> erm was your biggest achievement?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0526">probably the last traction engine <pause dur="short"/> mclaren compound</u>
<u n="4" who="S0486">right <pause dur="short"/> and erm was that? <pause dur="short"/> can you tell me the erm <pause dur="short"/> where that originates from the Mclaren compound?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0526">it was <pause dur="short"/> ordered by the War Office <pause dur="short"/> for service in the First World War <pause dur="short"/> but it never saw service but it wasn't completed until nineteen nineteen <pause dur="short"/> so it was surplus to requirements by that time</u>
<u n="6" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="7" who="S0526">it went <pause dur="short"/> for road haulage <pause dur="short"/> but the road hauliers didn't like it they said it was too big <pause dur="short"/> converted to a showman's engine the showman didn't like it <pause dur="short"/> because they said it was too big <pause dur="short"/> and subsequently the wheels were cut back to make it better for <pause dur="short"/> british roads <pause dur="short"/> the steering was moved from one side to the other for the same reason <pause dur="short"/> and it went back into service as a road locomotive heavy haulage</u>
<u n="8" who="S0486">oh right <pause dur="short"/> they are very dramatic I frequently see you at shows driving erm your steam engines <pause dur="short"/> erm what are you working on at the moment?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0526">erm my first railway engine <pause dur="short"/> which is a</u>
<u n="10" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="11" who="S0526">a narrow gauge engine <pause dur="short"/> at er <pause dur="short"/> seven and a quarter inch gauge <pause dur="short"/> but because it's a narrow gauge it works out at er <pause dur="short"/> almost third full size</u>
<u n="12" who="S0486">oh right <pause dur="short"/> I see and how far <pause dur="short"/> down <pause dur="short"/> down the line are you working on that?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0526" trans="overlap">I've <pause dur="short"/> I've a <pause dur="short"/> I have a rolling chassis I've been on it <pause dur="short"/> a year <pause dur="short"/> next month</u>
<u n="14" who="S0486">oh <pause dur="short"/> gosh <pause dur="short"/> so how much time do you put in every day?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0526">about three hours a day</u>
<u n="16" who="S0486">really?</u>
<u n="17" who="S0526">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0486">that's real dedication</u>
<u n="19" who="S0526">mm</u>
<u n="20" who="S0486">one of the things that's always appealed to me about the model engineers is the <pause dur="short"/> people who do it are real engineers <pause dur="short"/> they're not train spotters <pause dur="short"/> they're not <unclear/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0526" trans="overlap">oh no I'm not <trunc>n</trunc>not really</u>
<u n="22" who="S0486" trans="overlap">they're <pause dur="short"/> they're not train set people</u>
<u n="23" who="S0526">no <pause dur="short"/> I'm</u>
<u n="24" who="S0486"><trunc>the</trunc></u>
<u n="25" who="S0526">not really into railways railways have always left me cold erm from the age of nine</u>
<u n="26" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh right?</u>
<u n="27" who="S0526">to twenty-one <pause dur="short"/> we lived <pause dur="short"/> in a cottage with a very long garden <pause dur="short"/> at the bottom of which was the mainline railway track</u>
<u n="28" who="S0486">oh right?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0526">and I wasn't a bit interested in the trains</u>

<u n="34" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="35" who="S0526">and you hear a train coming and look out you could see the glow from the firebox as it went past</u>
<u n="36" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah yes</u>
<u n="37" who="S0526">but erm <pause dur="short"/> my biggest erm thought of railways at that time was that they <trunc>inter</trunc>interrupted whatever I was listening to whether it was the television or what</u>
<u n="38" who="S0486" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="39" who="S0526">you couldn't hear a thing as they trundled past</u>
<u n="40" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> well your <trunc>trai</trunc> your erm <trunc>d</trunc> engines here are a lot less noisy than that aren't they?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0526" trans="overlap">well of course they're a lot smaller <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="42" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and this has been a wonderful project on this <pause dur="short"/> field here <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="43" who="S0526" trans="overlap">it has it's had its ups and downs</u>
<u n="44" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0526" trans="overlap">it's not perfect but then whatever is?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0486">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I remember when they first said because I used to live in <anon type="place"/> erm er before I met <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> twenty years ago</u>
<u n="47" who="S0526" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0486">and erm <pause dur="short"/> when I lived here it was <trunc>a</trunc>around the time that somebody bulldozed the pavilion do you remember that?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0526">er no <pause dur="short"/> I don't actually remember it but I the story has been told to me on numerous occasions yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0486" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> numerous occasions <pause dur="short"/> and I remember</u>

<u n="54" who="S0486">well I I remember reading it in the gazette and I said when you said you <pause dur="short"/> when they all said they were coming here from <anon type="place"/> I thought my goodness <pause dur="short"/> oh dear <pause dur="short"/> I don't hold up much hope so I was quite pessimistic about it</u>
<u n="55" who="S0526"><unclear>yeah</unclear></u>
<u n="56" who="S0486">erm <pause dur="short"/> because there has been a <pause dur="short"/> I mean there was one lady I don't know whether you know this in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> who gave a talk at <anon type="place"/> hall <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> she came from London to talk to a group <pause dur="short"/> and the group <pause dur="short"/> outside there was erm <pause dur="short"/> a group of boys and they banged on the windows and pounded on the doors and <pause dur="short"/> she was so terrified she said she would rather give a talk in London than she would in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="57" who="S0526">really?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0486">and that yeah <pause dur="short"/> that there was such <pause dur="short"/> you know the erm <anon type="place"/> hall where</u>

<u n="67" who="S0526">least I didn't think so at the time</u>
<u n="68" who="S0486" trans="overlap">these <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> these were youngsters</u>
<u n="69" who="S0526" trans="overlap">I probably would now</u>

<u n="73" who="S0526" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="74" who="S0486">in Victorian England which I had found a collection of in a junk shop</u>
<u n="75" who="S0526">right?</u>
<u n="76" who="S0486">and I talked about it and I've got still got them and they're wonderful <pause dur="short"/> and erm they said to me oh we hope it's not like last <vocal desc="laugh"/> time and then they told me about it so that's how I knew</u>
<u n="77" who="S0526" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="78" who="S0486">of it really <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> anyway erm <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> the <pause dur="short"/> the erm <pause dur="short"/> project here has gone from strength to strength recently</u>
<u n="79" who="S0526">yes <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> well we've got about half a mile of track <pause dur="short"/> we've got points we've got sidings <pause dur="short"/> the first lot <pause dur="short"/> was fabricated off site <pause dur="short"/> at the engineering workshop of er <pause dur="short"/> of one of our members <pause dur="short"/> who is <pause dur="short"/> kind enough to let us use his equipment</u>
<u n="80" who="S0486">right?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0526">including his welder and his machines for for <pause dur="short"/> making points <pause dur="short"/> the rest was was built on the ground here on site</u>
<u n="82" who="S0486">right then you've got a turntable <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="83" who="S0526" trans="overlap">we have a turntable</u>
<u n="84" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0526">yeah <pause dur="short"/> we've</u>
<u n="86" who="S0486" trans="overlap">er</u>
<u n="87" who="S0526">we've got a return loop unfortunately we haven't <pause dur="short"/> a continuous run from the station <pause dur="short"/> so the trains go out go round a loop <pause dur="short"/> back through the woods <pause dur="short"/> and then back <pause dur="short"/> onto the turntable where they're turned <pause dur="short"/> and run around a train <pause dur="short"/> we have got a continuous loop down the bottom but that doesn't help passengers <pause dur="short"/> on and off the station</u>
<u n="88" who="S0486">right <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="89" who="S0526">so I've just seen somebody else turn up possibly with an engine</u>
<u n="90" who="S0486">oh right</u>
<u n="91" who="S0526">they did say they wanted to get the bugs out of this engine</u>
<u n="92" who="S0486">oh did they? <pause dur="short"/> oh right</u>
