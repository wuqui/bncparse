<u n="34" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="35" who="S0192">and they took the midnight ferry</u>
<u n="36" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="37" who="S0192">and then there were meant to drive to the spring</u>
<u n="38" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="39" who="S0192">I've haven't heard from her I've emailed her I've emailed his <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s grandparents nobody's getting back to me I haven't heard from anyone there's been no confirmation that they've actually arrived there and it's now Thursday</u>
<u n="40" who="S0227">is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0192">no he's not bothered he's just like I'm sure they're fine though mum told me that she'd message me</u>
<u n="42" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0192">I mean they should have arrived how long does it take to drive do you think?</u>
<u n="44" who="S0227">well it's it's a bloody long drive</u>
<u n="45" who="S0192">six hours through France six hours through Spain?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0227">not a chance France is twice the size of the <trunc>u</trunc> erm <trunc>Uni</trunc>United Kingdom</u>
<u n="47" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0227">and then Spain is about the same erm you're looking at about erm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0192">well they might be able to get some pretty big roads</u>
<u n="50" who="S0227">even with the tour roads um you're erm to the Spanish border from here south is probably about eight to nine hundred miles in a straight line</u>
<u n="51" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0227">then you've got to add the deviation to that</u>
<u n="53" who="S0192">it's nearly a thousand miles through just through the length of France</u>
<u n="54" who="S0227">yeah that's getting there it's about seven hundred to get into the probably eight hundred by road to get to the south of France erm the erm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0192">so what do you think then like a twenty hour journey?</u>
<u n="56" who="S0227">oh easy easy twenty hours</u>
<u n="57" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0227">twenty hours I would say I don't know how far down <trunc>Spa</trunc> erm we drove from we drove from erm Kian to Barcelona</u>
<u n="59" who="S0192">Barcelona</u>
<u n="60" who="S0227">and that took us quite a long time to do that</u>
<u n="61" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0227">and they're right right down near the Spanish border and they're much they're further south than Barcelona erm I imagine they're I don't know where</u>
<u n="63" who="S0192">oh yeah they are</u>
<u n="64" who="S0227">there's Costa Brava Costa Del Sol Costa</u>
<u n="65" who="S0192">they near to Alicante not too far from there</u>
<u n="66" who="S0227">not too far from Alicante? so probably</u>
<u n="67" who="S0192">erm Alicante's east coast isn't it? it's <trunc>fur</trunc> it's between Alicante and Melena</u>
<u n="68" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0192">it's near to <unclear/></u>
<u n="70" who="S0227">right that sounds like sounds like it could be Costa Del Sol</u>
<u n="71" who="S0192">Costa Del Sol</u>
<u n="72" who="S0227">erm so it's it's quite a drive I mean personally I wouldn't drive I would fly and hire a car</u>
<u n="73" who="S0192">no of course but they looked into flying and it was they said it was a thousand pounds for the three of them to fly and they said no we can't afford that</u>
<u n="74" who="S0227">erm I did go with easy easy</u>
<u n="75" who="S0192">they said they left the tickets too late too book and then when they went to book they couldn't find it cheaper than a thousand pounds for the three of them so they're driving</u>
<u n="76" who="S0227">what's the price of I mean you could have got down to this <unclear/> you could have this is not massively close but it is it is pretty close I suppose it's also the <unclear/> the expense of the car and they're going in peak season they're going in they've gone in the summer holidays</u>
<u n="77" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0227">so things will be <unclear/> the price of a plane ticket to Costa Del Sol which is south of France I think it was something like a hundred and twenty pounds for both of us return flights</u>
<u n="79" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0227">for both of us</u>
<u n="81" who="S0192">that's abnormally cheap</u>
<u n="82" who="S0227">erm yeah prices do pump up I would have probably bought the tickets erm erm further back</u>
<u n="83" who="S0192">I mean I told her that I was coming home six months before I came home and she was telling me then that they were going to Spain so why didn't they book their flight then? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0227">well um that's why when I responded to your email that I found it a little bit strange that she couldn't have locked into a commitment because she couldn't have booked a holiday at were because you have to book it you can't you can't book into the next year erm officially you have to wait until the new new financial year starts before you can do that so she hadn't booked a holiday erm so and then I did think well I don't think you've paid for your air flights because I was assuming they were going to go down by air now so why is it you can't move it which she did in the end anyway</u>
<u n="85" who="S0192">so should I not be worried then? it is possible they wouldn't have gotten there until midnight on Tuesday and then</u>
<u n="86" who="S0227" trans="overlap">she should yes</u>
<u n="87" who="S0192">and then they could have been sleeping all of Wednesday</u>
<u n="88" who="S0227">yeah I'd leave it until this afternoon if you haven't heard anything get your brother to ring and see if he gets anything cos they should by this afternoon she should have got her act together erm they got a phone between the lot of them erm to make the call to say yes we're here erm a little drive especially with erm I don't know if your mum was going to take turns but a long drive especially when you consider that erm like in the car is a young child they can sleep for some of that you can't sleep for all of it and it's a question of how much how stimulated he's kept</u>
<u n="89" who="S0192">they were silly as well they weren't leaving after a full night's sleep they were leaving after a full day's being awake</u>
<u n="90" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="91" who="S0192">they were leaving at midnight</u>
<u n="92" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="93" who="S0192">which means it seems ridiculous they have to drive another twenty-four hours without sleeping</u>
<u n="94" who="S0227">yes yes unfortunately erm I think sometimes they act like um <unclear/> some places when mum was a teenager they kind of did those things that you can do that that thing when you're young when we went when I drove down to south of France with family erm we we left at about one or two o'clock in the morning because they had gone through the <unclear/> being able to get to sleep before that be I wasn't sure <unclear/> because I knew they were coming back</u>
<u n="95" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0227">so I went on a drive down there without any sleep we got to <unclear>Leon</unclear> because we weren't taking the toll roads we were taking the not toll roads to save money plus the car wasn't the best car in the world health wise and erm erm about seven o'clock that night it went down <unclear/> which is just <unclear/> the south of France but I was I was twenty twenty-four at the time driving a fifty-one <unclear/></u>
<u n="97" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0227">especially if I you know you're fifty-one and you haven't had a night you've been asleep</u>
<u n="99" who="S0192">yeah it's ridiculous</u>
<u n="100" who="S0227">I would have gone in the daytime</u>
<u n="101" who="S0192">oh yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0227">but I'm thinking they're looking at staying a night in France so we'll just carry one in the night erm then sleep for most of the journey</u>
<u n="103" who="S0192">I think that was the main reason they wanted to go to sleep</u>
<u n="104" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0192"><unclear/> twenty hours</u>
<u n="106" who="S0227"><unclear/> I don't know if he if he's a good sleeper or he might be one who has six or seven hours sleep <pause dur="short"/> yes so erm I can only imagine that your mum's gonna do some of the driving as well but erm I don't know how comfortable she would be with that it is a long it is a lot just to put on one's shoulders</u>
<u n="107" who="S0192">selfish but I do wish they'd never had <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> at all the whole family apparently have <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s children don't have much contact with him now because they pretty much resent <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> so</u>
<u n="108" who="S0227">oh it's another uh they will probably especially if they're female they would look at it as though their family was a prototype erm and he's now got a new family now this was the <unclear/> to block out all the wrinkles to save the family</u>
<u n="109" who="S0192">I think the main problem is with their uh now <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s had three children and she's thinking well I wanted you to be a grandfather to my children and you've barely got any time to do anything</u>
<u n="110" who="S0227">no because he's and it must have been erm it must have been a <trunc>sho</trunc>shock for her because the they were they was only about a month or so in it that when she told him that she was he was going to be a grandmother erm father he countered with oh by the way I'm gonna become a father again that would have pulled the rug from under her</u>
<u n="111" who="S0192"><unclear/></u>
<u n="112" who="S0227">yes it would have done and the thought that my dad and his new erm wife having another child and then a boy erm she it would have also hurt by proxy his first wife because they had two children together which were daughters she probably wanted a son he probably wanted a son with her I meant it must have been debated on he would have liked to have a boy that never happened he then had another marriage that didn't work and then he had a marriage again and had a child erm <unclear/> so for him for for them they they feel like feel like our family is is it doesn't it doesn't necessarily cement the families together</u>
<u n="113" who="S0192">no it doesn't</u>
<u n="114" who="S0227">the children can feel they will feel this is our family he's related to us but he's part of that new family you know and we're old guard um</u>
<u n="115" who="S0192">mum's hurt as well because erm refuses to let her children call mum grandmother so she's not a grandmother at all because they don't call her anything so they don't see her as a grandmother even though she says she puts in as much attention as she can</u>
<u n="116" who="S0227">I think she's I think she's right in that sense that yes because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> isn't your grandfather then</u>
<u n="117" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0227">uh I agree with yes she should be the grandmother</u>
<u n="119" who="S0192">she's growing up with them</u>
<u n="120" who="S0227">is is it better to have ten grandmothers or no grandmothers?</u>
<u n="121" who="S0192">yeah I only grew up with one grandmother and one grandfather</u>
<u n="122" who="S0227">yes exactly</u>
<u n="123" who="S0192">I only have one granddad that I don't ever see</u>
<u n="124" who="S0227">yes I do agree with her if she puts the effort and she wants to be as well</u>
<u n="125" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0227">erm so it's yeah that but they shouldn't be surprised about the dismay that his daughters had because um</u>
<u n="127" who="S0192">no I don't think they're surprised I think they're just wishing it was</u>
<u n="128" who="S0227"><unclear>that's how it's</unclear> going to be but um</u>
<u n="129" who="S0192">but they chose to have <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="130" who="S0227">well yes but I would imagine</u>
<u n="131" who="S0192">it's their choice and they have to live with the consequences of their choice</u>
<u n="132" who="S0227">indeed</u>
<u n="133" who="S0192">you can't guarantee how people are going to react to it</u>
<u n="134" who="S0227">no this this was clearly a they were both on separate agendas they have never actually been honest with each other I doubt if asked a question when she was pregnant together by someone erm what are you hoping the baby will be because they were both operating under different agendas both of them would have come up with the standard stock answer we don't mind as long as it's healthy as long as the baby is healthy which is a true statement but it's not the the full truth he would have been secretly thinking and hoping</u>
<u n="135" who="S0192">boy</u>
<u n="136" who="S0227">it's a boy and she was wanting a girl one of them was going to be disappointed unless it was twins and was going be one of each</u>
<u n="137" who="S0192"><unclear/></u>
<u n="138" who="S0227">yeah so erm so when it she gave birth I don't know if she knew beforehand it was going to be a boy or she was waiting you know to be pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised</u>
<u n="139" who="S0192">apparently it's a boy it's a hyperactive little boy like me and apparently he's very similar to if I was that annoying when I was a little boy I'm very sorry <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="140" who="S0227">I <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="141" who="S0192">I hear he's like two little boys</u>
<u n="142" who="S0227">I haven't spent any time with them I've <unclear/> stuff like that but</u>
<u n="143" who="S0192">from waking up to going to bed he has a lot a lot of energy</u>
<u n="144" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="145" who="S0192">a lot of energy</u>
<u n="146" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0192">and I guess I was like that too apparently <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> wasn't so</u>
<u n="148" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="149" who="S0192">that is a lot of work</u>
<u n="150" who="S0227">I don't remember you being that bad to be fair</u>
<u n="151" who="S0192">no?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0227">but I would imagine I'm just trying to <unclear/> similarity with you so that you connect making connections erm obviously <trunc>af</trunc>after having him I mean you had to <unclear/> because if she tried to go at the gate like her sister did her sister was going to go at the gate as many times as it took her to get <unclear/> a boy even though she was telling oh she was on the pill she was not taking them and he was stupid enough to fall to fall for that twice</u>
<u n="153" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="154" who="S0227">it was a case that she knew that she was <unclear/> to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was coming up with the old with the excuses that I would come up with the real excuse is don't need to have another child I've got all the help I need I have one son two daughters I don't need any more I don't need to be more tired don't need you to be more tired and the money it's going to cost us to raise another yet another one</u>
<u n="155" who="S0192">at that point it's his duty to have a vasectomy</u>
<u n="156" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0192">had you ever considered that?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="159" who="S0192">it sounds horrible</u>
<u n="160" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="161" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="162" who="S0192"><unclear/></u>
<u n="163" who="S0227">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> sounds <trunc>p</trunc></u>
<u n="164" who="S0192">it looks like a really</u>
<u n="165" who="S0227">sounds painful</u>
<u n="166" who="S0192">I don't really wanna get it done <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s brother's got it done</u>

<u n="172" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="173" who="S0227">so erm <trunc>sh</trunc> if I was <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> if if mum had gone to the well again I would say look we can't er A we're too old that was the first excuse the second is we can't afford it what I wouldn't have said but which was the real reason as I said was <vocal desc="laugh"/> don't need don't need it</u>
<u n="174" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="175" who="S0227">I've got what I want she hasn't got what she wants</u>
<u n="176" who="S0192">what did you mean nature took care of itself?</u>
<u n="177" who="S0227">er well I won't be erm having any more children because er erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>

<u n="305" who="S0227">and the ceiling of that will never be as high as the ceiling as an doctor so</u>
<u n="306" who="S0192"><unclear/> you're always gonna be competing</u>
<u n="307" who="S0227">so by coming a</u>
<u n="308" who="S0192"><unclear/></u>
