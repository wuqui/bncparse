<u n="76" who="S0327">you know what I would say? I would say it's worth it <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> if if you can do it er cos I mean getting it you know you are in a very special position having having the wherewithal to do it not everybody does and I suspect a first will stand you well in stead in various whatever happens in your life</u>
<u n="77" who="S0326">yeah well er it's just sort of satisfying as well</u>
<u n="78" who="S0327">and it's satisfying exactly erm</u>

<u n="89" who="S0326">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0327">and not very helpful</u>
<u n="91" who="S0326">mm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0327">and you know both her mum and I have said look you're paying nine thousand a year you wanna get your</u>
<u n="93" who="S0326" trans="overlap"><unclear>it's a</unclear> demand yeah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0327">money's worth</u>
<u n="95" who="S0326">cos also lots of</u>
<u n="96" who="S0327" trans="overlap">but she's also finding the work <trunc>interes</trunc> I think she works she probably has to work harder than you do to to get as far but erm I think she's also finding it interesting</u>
<u n="97" who="S0326">yeah she er erm messaged me the other week cos she's doing a <trunc>s</trunc> a dissertation about beekeeping in the</u>
<u n="98" who="S0327" trans="overlap">I think yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0326">in the ancient Mediterranean</u>
<u n="100" who="S0327">I think that's really interesting</u>
<u n="101" who="S0326">so I was telling her some texts er sort sort of cos the Romans were really obsessed with bees</u>
<u n="102" who="S0327">were they?</u>
<u n="103" who="S0326" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0327">were they?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0326">they think they could <trunc>l</trunc> they they thought you could sort of tell <trunc>y</trunc>you know sort of augury with birds? they did the same thing with bees <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="106" who="S0327">did they <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0326" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah and then Virgil wrote a whole sort of book of poetry about bees <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> he says they're like er</u>
<u n="108" who="S0327" trans="overlap">well I think it'd be really great if she can put together a thesis on that</u>
<u n="109" who="S0326" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0327">because erm I mean I suppose there are some are there? some complete what's happened there?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0326">oh it got smashed up <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="112" who="S0327">erm well she ought we ought to pick your brains then</u>
<u n="113" who="S0326">yeah I mean <pause dur="short"/> yeah they really like them and they were interested in them and they think they can they think if they sort of if there's a swarm of bees they <trunc>m</trunc> it means so and so's gonna happen er you know?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0327">I don't think we've got any further erm much since then</u>
<u n="115" who="S0326"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="116" who="S0327">you know I would just as soon put my faith in a swarm of bees as I would in the in the weather forecast these days <vocal desc="laugh"/> frankly erm <pause dur="short"/> yes no I think that's that's really really good and I mean the the best thing is to of course to be interested</u>
<u n="117" who="S0326">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0327">erm <pause dur="short"/> and what do you have to choose a thesis? or are you?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0326">erm I don't have I mean I probably will do a dissertation next year but I haven't I can't really <trunc>dec</trunc> think of something to do it about <pause dur="short"/> erm I'll probably do something er sort of reception <trunc>y</trunc>you know like sort of reception theory</u>
<u n="120" who="S0327">no what's reception theory?</u>
<u n="121" who="S0326">it's kind of like just the way you I think it it just makes classics sort of relevant to me the way <pause dur="short"/> you interpret er instead of trying to <trunc>ac</trunc> think like a Roman you think like a sort of someone from the twenty-first century when you read the texts so <pause dur="short"/> it's sort of like books like <vocal desc="cough"/> like Homer in the twentieth century <pause dur="short"/> how to interpret differently</u>
<event desc="sound of cooking"/>
<u n="122" who="S0327">did they say twelve minutes for this? <pause dur="short"/> twelve minutes</u>
<u n="123" who="S0326">ah</u>
<u n="124" who="S0327">oh <pause dur="short"/> I'm just trying to get my head round that</u>
<u n="125" who="S0326">so it's just the way sort of it's it's really sort of simple it's just the way you respond to something it's the way you receive it</u>
<u n="126" who="S0327">yes</u>
<u n="127" who="S0326">but it's in classics it's interesting because there's sort of a <trunc>dialo</trunc> so if you look at Homer people have been receiving that sort of all the way through from like Roman to from Greek to Roman to the Middle Ages to now and it's I think it's it's counter-intuitive if you think everybody's response responds the same way to things erm</u>
<u n="128" who="S0327">er <trunc>r</trunc> you mean everybody within a <trunc>perio</trunc> or everybody over a very long period?</u>
<u n="129" who="S0326">over sort of it make it makes the the work sort of <trunc>s</trunc> you you can like free it from its position er and and sort of rework it and look at it new</u>
<u n="130" who="S0327" trans="overlap">and look at it new yes <pause dur="short"/> well I mean to some extent we do that anyhow don't we?</u>
<u n="131" who="S0326" trans="overlap">yeah it's it's that's why it's like sort of simple but</u>
<u n="132" who="S0327" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="133" who="S0326">I <trunc>th</trunc> I just think it's a bit it's helpful to think erm try and get into the mindset of of sort of Greek and Romans but it's not</u>
<u n="134" who="S0327">yes</u>
<u n="135" who="S0326">the it's not the end all and be all</u>
<u n="136" who="S0327">right <pause dur="short"/> I mean <trunc>f</trunc> you know it seems to me that politically a lot of stuff people think oh they shouldn't have done this or they shouldn't have <trunc>d</trunc> you know you take something like I don't know anti-Semitism well anti-Semitism say in the early nineteenth century</u>
<u n="137" who="S0326">mm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0327">er was going to be er seen very differently from the way it is now</u>
<u n="139" who="S0326">yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0327">and lots of people can't do that they can't make that leap erm you know there's erm a that's that's one of the things I didn't like about postmodernism when it came in or or literary theory that that everything was judged from the viewpoint now er I mean <trunc>w</trunc> I'm talking about within art so you take someone like Gauguin and you would deconstruct and look at him in terms of colonialism and so on but actually that really wasn't his fault</u>
<u n="141" who="S0326">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0327">that was the world he was born into he why would he have taken much notice of that? he was an artist so you can't say these paintings aren't any good or not to be taken seriously or we dismiss them erm because they are politically doubtful</u>
<u n="143" who="S0326">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and so it er kind of keeps things alive because they're not <trunc>f</trunc> really fixed</u>
<u n="144" who="S0327">not er they're not fixed very little is fixed <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="145" who="S0326" trans="overlap">it's interesting yeah exactly which is just sort of <pause dur="short"/> it's I think it's it frees you up from kind of sort of lots of academic stuff you try and fit things into little straightjackets</u>
<u n="146" who="S0327">yes</u>
<u n="147" who="S0326">erm and I think it's just more interesting and more more good to think with like more sort of gives your er your own ideas</u>
<u n="148" who="S0327">well I know that at some point a few months ago <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said that what they what they want from them in their what is she? in her third year is a personal view of er</u>
<u n="149" who="S0326">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0327">and I thought actually for archaeology that is really difficult <pause dur="short"/> I mean how can you have a <trunc>p</trunc>? I can see what you're doing <trunc>y</trunc>you know in a way <vocal desc="cough"/> things are more general erm because you're looking at the way that all society responds to things but for archaeology when you're talking about artefacts which have been scientifically</u>
<u n="151" who="S0326" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0327">and chemically dated and so on how are you supposed to be original about that?</u>
<u n="153" who="S0326">it's not easy really</u>
<u n="154" who="S0327">I mean I think those Tudors were just bored and they've come up with they want to be entertained a bit <unclear/></u>
<u n="155" who="S0326">but they might <unclear>as well</unclear> ask people to do that because it's it's more <trunc>int</trunc> it's more <trunc>in</trunc>interesting for yourself as well</u>
<u n="156" who="S0327">yes</u>
<u n="157" who="S0326">instead of just copying things out of books</u>
<u n="158" who="S0327" trans="overlap">exactly otherwise you know er erm and you know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s got a rather piercing and original mind and er but she can also just absorb facts you can both do that in a way I never could it's very very impressive how's <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> getting on?</u>
<u n="159" who="S0326">he's er I think he's alright he's actually I saw him last night he's in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0327">right</u>
<u n="161" who="S0326">erm I think he's <trunc>d</trunc> I think I think he's sort of finished for the year</u>
<u n="162" who="S0327">oh has he?</u>
<u n="163" who="S0326">I mean he has like a sort of study period that he er and then does exams I think</u>
<u n="164" who="S0327">right</u>
<u n="165" who="S0326">but I think his sort of tuition has ended already <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="166" who="S0327" trans="overlap">okay really? and we're only in March</u>
<u n="167" who="S0326" trans="overlap">well it ends er or it ends in ends in <pause dur="short"/> good Friday</u>
<u n="168" who="S0327" trans="overlap">and is he supposed to do stuff on his own?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0326">yeah I think they er I think he'll he'll have work to do but he doesn't have to be in <anon type="place"/> necessarily</u>
<u n="170" who="S0327">right <pause dur="short"/> and has he got over being dumped?</u>
<u n="171" who="S0326">dunno</u>
<u n="172" who="S0327">you don't know?</u>
<u n="173" who="S0326"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0327">you don't know if there's a new girlfriend on the scene?</u>
<u n="175" who="S0326">erm I don't know if there is should be <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="176" who="S0327">well it's perfectly possible to go for a little while without</u>
<u n="177" who="S0326"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="178" who="S0327">erm and you've still got your lovely cake-maker?</u>

<u n="800" who="S0327">oh didn't they?</u>
<u n="801" who="S0326">it wasn't very I mean they did but it was <trunc>f</trunc> especially for sort of living people <pause dur="short"/> they weren't really it wasn't really er portraiture or or erm public sort of <trunc>m</trunc> commemorative statues of er real life people</u>
<u n="802" who="S0327">so that started also what? in the</u>
<u n="803" who="S0326">yeah</u>
<u n="804" who="S0327">fifth century?</u>
<u n="805" who="S0326">about then yeah</u>
<u n="806" who="S0327">maybe because there was some particularly skilled sculptors perhaps?</u>
<u n="807" who="S0326">well no well I it's I mean er portraiture really becomes a thing er sort of in the Hellenistic period and it's interesting when er</u>
<u n="808" who="S0327">and that isn't <unclear>another</unclear> couple of years a <trunc>h</trunc> couple of hundred years later</u>
<u n="809" who="S0326">yeah it sort of starts at three two three BC</u>

<u n="817" who="S0326">it's in er it's <trunc>w</trunc>it's what I was thinking about when I did this essay sort of how cos the way that people when sort of Pericles in his famous funeral oration he talks about sort of loving the city but he uses <trunc>Ero</trunc>Eros as in you're meant to love it's er it's er like er Plato says you <unclear/> you need to love knowledge and you have to have Eros for it it's all sort of erotic <pause dur="short"/> like I think eroticism is <trunc>r</trunc> at sort of er the <trunc>c</trunc>the core of a lot of er sort of deeper things about Athenian life</u>
<u n="818" who="S0327">erm do you think that it's possible that because those two were powerful they kind of er <trunc>li</trunc>liberated homosexuality in some way? <trunc>th</trunc>they made it okay?</u>

<u n="826" who="S0327">Homer was written at eight hundred BC? as early as that?</u>
<u n="827" who="S0326">but I mean the stories are probably older <trunc>l</trunc>like they're probably from</u>

<u n="829" who="S0326">yeah</u>
<u n="830" who="S0327">utterly fascinating cos we still don't really know how we emerged I mean the more and more <trunc>f</trunc> I mean I don't really hardly read <unclear>anything I can't</unclear> keep up with all that but it does seem as though we emerge pretty well with our behaviour patterns in already in place</u>
<u n="831" who="S0326">yeah</u>
<u n="832" who="S0327">rather than evolve I mean have we evolved? psychologically we've certainly not evolved er for the better</u>
<u n="833" who="S0326">mm yeah</u>
<u n="834" who="S0327">er in some ways I mean there is an aspect of contemporary society where there is a place for empathy now in the last really since post-World War Two</u>

<u n="836" who="S0327">but it's completely recent</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="837" who="S0326">I <trunc>d</trunc> er yeah I just get er cos it's interesting when you look at sort of east and west sort of this <trunc>Chi</trunc> sort of the Chinese wisdom or Far Eastern wisdom's totally different from Greek</u>
<u n="838" who="S0327">yes</u>
<u n="839" who="S0326">and those were the two sort of modes of life or sort of patterns of existence that people operate in</u>

<u n="841" who="S0326">and they come from sort of two small places</u>
<u n="842" who="S0327">well I think we think that it's still probably just slightly more human to have a life in the west if you can ignore all the hundreds of wars there have been I mean to me there is still something fairly horrendous about China I mean if you think of the lives that most sort of the Chinese must live now you know?</u>
<u n="843" who="S0326" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="844" who="S0327">working fifteen sixteen hours a day for for a pittance so you you know now they're getting a a middle class and upper class but it does rather frighten me the thought a lot of artists are going over there and they usually have a horrible time</u>
<u n="845" who="S0326">yeah I mean there's that erm I watched a quite good documentary about Apple and er sort of how they make their factories in China and stuff and they're just erm entire cities that are just factories sort of you live there and you work there with like twenty thousand people</u>

<u n="850" who="S0327">yes right oh really?</u>
<u n="851" who="S0326">erm <pause dur="short"/> and sort of really sort of strange existence of er sort of er these companies set like they just sort of build out of nowhere whole <trunc>s</trunc> towns but all they are is sort of factory and then places where people can sleep and then go back to work and people just sort of <trunc>c</trunc>come from the countryside and live there</u>

<u n="855" who="S0326">there was this</u>

<u n="928" who="S0327">and he's on the radio every week and I think what he does is very good</u>
<u n="929" who="S0326">the er the other week my erm I I <trunc>w</trunc>woke up to that programme it was it was him and then my erm teacher</u>

<u n="935" who="S0327">well it's very nice that <unclear>there are</unclear> still places like that</u>
<u n="936" who="S0326">and I <trunc>l</trunc> I tell them I really <trunc>li</trunc> I <trunc>t</trunc> like <trunc>t</trunc> have one that's <trunc>tw</trunc>two hours <pause dur="short"/> and <trunc>o</trunc>one that's generally about an hour</u>
<u n="937" who="S0327">mm</u>
<u n="938" who="S0326">but also any time you wanted sort of extra time you just sort of they would be they're really happy like willing to like to <trunc>t</trunc>talk talk something through with them they like I mean er like they obviously enjoy it and so I think it's <trunc>m</trunc> it's more rewarding than other universities cos you can you have a real relationship with them</u>
<u n="939" who="S0327">oh it's very good that I mean at I don't know what art schools are like now most of them aren't like that but most of my teaching years we had long tutorials you know at least an hour and I <trunc>h</trunc>have several friends who've remained <trunc>f</trunc> close friends who were students</u>
<u n="940" who="S0326">mm</u>
<u n="941" who="S0327">and that's very that's very rewarding I mean one of the great things about that kind of relationship is you actually can talk about what you're interested in <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> which is not so easy in social life</u>
<u n="942" who="S0326">yeah</u>
<u n="943" who="S0327">you know I mean artists don't talk about art when they're together they they er they complain about their dealers or they talk about money</u>

<u n="948" who="S0326">yeah no</u>
<u n="949" who="S0327">so it's it is very very nice that was always what I liked about teaching <pause dur="long"/> but that's very interesting what you say about the <unclear/> of course those communities going back to pre-ancient Greece or ancient ancient Greece those communities must have been very small</u>
<u n="950" who="S0326">yeah</u>
<u n="951" who="S0327">I mean that's I think one of the problems that's happened everything is now so enormous and everybody's in touch with everybody</u>
<u n="952" who="S0326">yeah <unclear/> yeah sort of globalisation <unclear>of the</unclear> world</u>
<u n="953" who="S0327">I mean I'm sure there's some very good things about it but</u>

<u n="955" who="S0327">yes</u>
<u n="956" who="S0326">kinda cos I think erm I I even I even I can sort of remember just sort of looking at photos and books of other places you know that were sort of like exciting and when you're a child it's like imagine</u>
<u n="957" who="S0327">yes</u>
<u n="958" who="S0326">but now it's sort of that's would be totally <trunc>unr</trunc> sort of <unclear>unrewarding</unclear> compared to a film or</u>
<u n="959" who="S0327">yeah I think that's that's a problem I mean when I er er started travelling just in Europe it was very exciting but when I then went somewhere like Morocco mind you I suspect there are still places in in</u>

<u n="987" who="S0327">ah yes</u>
