<u n="1" who="S0268">it's a <trunc>co</trunc> becomes a bit of a competition then</u>
<u n="2" who="S0269">mm</u>
<u n="3" who="S0268">so where's their where's Maddox and that lot where's their report? <pause dur="short"/> where's their environmental <unclear/></u>
<u n="4" who="S0269" trans="overlap">well they they've said they it's not necessary</u>
<u n="5" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="6" who="S0269">ideally you want <anon type="place"/> to say well you do your bloody assessment</u>
<u n="7" who="S0268">exactly</u>
<u n="8" who="S0269">it puts cost on them</u>
<u n="9" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="10" who="S0269">that's was the because they're what we had opted for the turbines think of as many ways as you can and ducking and diving <pause dur="short"/> and kicking the can down the road</u>
<u n="11" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0269">and think of as many things as you can to put cost on <unclear>Del Boy</unclear></u>
<u n="13" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0269">and that's when we brought the heritage expert out of the top hat</u>
<u n="15" who="S0268">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0269"><vocal desc="laugh"/> but oh I don't I'm getting a bit old for all these fights <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="17" who="S0268">yeah you're getting very <pause dur="short"/> cantankerous in your old age</u>
<u n="18" who="S0269"><vocal desc="laugh"/> what you on about? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="19" who="S0268">what have I got to do? <pause dur="short"/> so you don't like me doing this?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0269">well <pause dur="short"/> what's it what's this reading Telegraph and all then?</u>
<u n="21" who="S0268">oh got it on</u>
<u n="22" who="S0269">oh god well I were er we should have seen pressing buttons won't we?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0268">right it's not really it's not really</u>
<u n="24" who="S0269"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="25" who="S0268">so where were we?</u>
<u n="26" who="S0269">yeah well we we were kicking the can down the road</u>
<u n="27" who="S0268">yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0269">as quickly as we could</u>
<u n="29" who="S0268">mm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="30" who="S0269">but I would think the <pause dur="short"/> the outcome would be the members say well it's all too much er to take in defer the decision <pause dur="short"/> kick it down the road for a month and then refuse it</u>
<u n="31" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0269">seek more information</u>
<u n="33" who="S0268">but that would be the ideal thing <pause dur="short"/> absolutely and it happened so many times in our case didn't it? er referrals and</u>
<u n="34" who="S0269" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0268">so yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0269">the worst the worst outcome is if they approve it but I can't see that</u>
<u n="37" who="S0268">right</u>
<u n="38" who="S0269">so they either reject it or defer it</u>
<u n="39" who="S0268">are we all going? are we the three of us going? we are?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0269">I would think so</u>
<u n="41" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0269">half past six</u>
<u n="43" who="S0268">mm <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> you sure it's half past six? yeah I think it is just</u>

<u n="47" who="S0268">just but I <trunc>c</trunc> I six o'clock seems to</u>
<u n="48" who="S0269">mm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0268">stick in my mind more than six thirty</u>
<u n="50" who="S0269">but the other thing that's concerning me is er <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> seems to be away</u>
<u n="51" who="S0268">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0269">in fact I went round her house <pause dur="short"/> cos she didn't <pause dur="short"/> respond to the emails she didn't respond to the phone calls and I thought oh</u>
