<u n="105" who="S0167">why?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0378">because <pause dur="short"/> I'd left Staples voluntarily <pause dur="long"/> even though I'd just</u>

<u n="110" who="S0378">they said no</u>
<u n="111" who="S0167">that's very strange</u>

<u n="113" who="S0167">so you</u>
<u n="114" who="S0378" trans="overlap">since my job</u>
<u n="115" who="S0167">well I've done that <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="116" who="S0378">I know but I don't know why they and erm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0167" trans="overlap">that's a oh</u>
<u n="118" who="S0378" trans="overlap">yeah the only thing I got from them because I literally had zero money zero zero zero zero</u>
<u n="119" who="S0167" trans="overlap">yeah that's what I did</u>
<u n="120" who="S0378" trans="overlap">was a travel card cos I said I've got an interview I can't get there</u>

<u n="125" who="S0167">well I guess that's something but</u>
<u n="126" who="S0378">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so that was yeah really lucky</u>
<u n="127" who="S0167">that's stupid because it just discourages people from taking jobs then cos you think well I may as well not take this job because I may as well just go on Jobseeker's if they're gonna start punishing people for having a job which essentially is what they've done to you</u>
<u n="128" who="S0378">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0167">I mean it's not like <trunc>yo</trunc> so if you'd just sat at home being a student and not bothering to do anything</u>
