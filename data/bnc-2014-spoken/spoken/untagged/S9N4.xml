<u n="47" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0082">and um er I er you know he he would've been an ideal person cos</u>
<u n="49" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="50" who="S0082">it's not that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> doesn't know a lot about the countryside round here cos she's lived in this area longer than <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has <pause dur="short"/> you know she moved here in the <trunc>s</trunc> nineteen sixties I think</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0082">but um <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has just spent a lot of time you know sort of er involved in er all sorts of things <pause dur="short"/> and also <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s on the area he's the area secretary <pause dur="short"/> and you've got  you've got  the groups <pause dur="short"/> you've got all you know</u>
<u n="53" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="54" who="S0082"><anon type="place"/> group <pause dur="short"/> south <anon type="place"/> group <pause dur="short"/> east <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="57" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0082">which is called <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> well it's actually called <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> but it's basically <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> so it's all the groups in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="60" who="S0082">so he's stopped being er on the committee of our group which is <anon type="place"/> group</u>
<u n="61" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="62" who="S0082">but he's on the committee of the er area group which is called <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> and he's the secretary <pause dur="short"/> so so um I um you know I I believe he er would be the right person <pause dur="short"/> but I mean</u>
<u n="63" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="64" who="S0082"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> might want to do it herself or she might suggest somebody else</u>
<u n="65" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0082">the er the person who could do it very well is somebody called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="67" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0082">who used to work on the county council <pause dur="short"/> she was very senior</u>
<u n="69" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="70" who="S0082">on the county council <pause dur="short"/> but um when she retired she's just I think she's just about sixty now when she retired you know a lot of the <trunc>c</trunc> council work is farmed out to um what do they call them? Um</u>
<u n="71" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">right I'm gonna pop up the pharmacy</u>
<u n="72" who="S0082">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="73" who="S0084">alright</u>
<u n="74" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">be back in a bit</u>
<u n="75" who="S0082">you alright? Yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0084">see you in a bit</u>
<u n="77" who="S0082">um and they er outsourcing you know when they</u>
<u n="78" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="79" who="S0082">you know councils outsource so much work these days</u>
<u n="80" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0082">and when <trunc>Ji</trunc> er and obviously she must've been involved in outsourcing when she was a member of the council because when um she got to retirement the <trunc>outs</trunc> one of the outsourcing companies</u>
<u n="82" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0082">er presumably knew her knew about her offered her a job <pause dur="short"/> offered her basic er basically as far as I'm aware offered her her old job <pause dur="short"/> in other words she used to work for the council doing these various things</u>
<u n="84" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0082">which was outsourced because she was retiring</u>
<u n="86" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0082">so the company to whom it was outsourced got in touch with her and said would you be prepared to do your job but for us?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="89" who="S0082">and that's what she's doing <pause dur="short"/> and er I think she's probably earning a hell of a lot more money</u>
<u n="90" who="S0084">nice</u>
<u n="91" who="S0082">doing it <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="92" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0082">um so therefore she's another one <pause dur="short"/> she she's like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> very very knowledgeable <pause dur="short"/> you know <trunc>invol</trunc> been involved in all sorts of um um matters with the because she was on the council <pause dur="short"/> she's a you know she's a member of <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> she's also a member of something called <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> cos there's a there's an in there's lots of rambling groups in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> but the one that um you know people of my generation and older er er think about in addition to <anon type="place"/> is <anon type="place"/> which is a an independent</u>
<u n="94" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0082">one <pause dur="short"/> er she's president of that <pause dur="short"/> she's secretary of our group <pause dur="short"/> she used to be the secretary of area but she resigned cos she just had too much to do</u>

<u n="98" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="99" who="S0082">so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> or <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> would be good <pause dur="short"/> but for the reasons I said I don't think either of them will be available tomorrow <pause dur="short"/> cos</u>

<u n="140" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0082">but um when I got there they hired a coach had hired a coach</u>

<u n="152" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0082">but she couldn't go <pause dur="short"/> she she's full-<trunc>ti</trunc> she's still full-time teacher er <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>

<u n="158" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="159" who="S0082">um with their families and who else was there? Oh yeah there's a woman er I would say in her forties who doesn't like groups <pause dur="short"/> prefers to do it one to one</u>
<u n="160" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="161" who="S0082">she's a bit intimidated by groups which is  which is  fine you know</u>

<u n="166" who="S0084">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> um yeah <pause dur="short"/> and there were two um er sponsors for one of the women that comes to our group <pause dur="short"/> um she well in fact I think there was one sponsor but I can't I don't know whether the <trunc>th</trunc> just trying to remember who it was now <pause dur="short"/> the thing is they both went <trunc>ou</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> what happens is the service is basically to show um er people thinking about the Church what it's like as a diocese <pause dur="short"/> cos all they've seen so far is a small group of people</u>
<u n="167" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="168" who="S0084">in their area</u>
<u n="169" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0082">in their parish church</u>
<u n="171" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0082">you know <anon type="place"/> is a fairly big parish but I mean some of them are very small parishes</u>
<u n="173" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="174" who="S0082">so it's to give them an idea of what happens in the diocese <pause dur="short"/> so er and there are two types of person er who are um er or the Church divides them into two types <pause dur="short"/> there are lots of types but the Church divides them into two types</u>
<u n="175" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="176" who="S0082">of person who are seeking you know information about the Church <pause dur="short"/> there's those that have been baptized in another Christian Church like me</u>
<u n="177" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="178" who="S0082">as I was er when I um was received <pause dur="short"/> and there are those who are not baptized</u>
<u n="179" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="180" who="S0082">and the ones who are not baptized are called catechumens</u>
<u n="181" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="182" who="S0082">that's an old sort of technical word</u>
<u n="183" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0082">and the ones that already are baptized er are called candidates</u>
<u n="185" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="186" who="S0082">male or female <pause dur="short"/> um and what happens is that the two groups separately go and meet what in the past would have been the bishop <pause dur="short"/> but <trunc>becau</trunc> but because the bishop died</u>
<u n="187" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0082">his deputy er er on official on the official level</u>
<u n="189" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="190" who="S0082">you know on a sort of civic and pageantry level um er is it's quite strange actually <pause dur="short"/> his his office is called vicar general <pause dur="short"/> um but it's only he's only called vicar general when the bishop's alive <pause dur="short"/> so when the bishop can't go to something</u>
<u n="191" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="192" who="S0082">he sends the vicar general</u>
<u n="193" who="S0084">he nominates him</u>
<u n="194" who="S0082">okay <pause dur="short"/> but if a <trunc>bish</trunc> <trunc>v</trunc> if a bishop dies or for some reason can't continue</u>
<u n="195" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0082">you know steps down or whatever then the vicar general becomes the administrator <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure why <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="386" who="S0084">is it in the traditional sort of base and stand? Rather than like a hole in the ground?</u>
<u n="387" who="S0082">yeah it's it's basic I mean basically they don't they they what they tend to do is make it up on the sanctuary <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="388" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="389" who="S0082">so it's so that er they can tip water in it</u>

<u n="392" who="S0084">oh okay</u>
<u n="393" who="S0082">um and but for children I think there is one and I think it's at the back of the church <pause dur="short"/> I think it's um as you come in you know when you come in er if you go on the side aisle <pause dur="short"/> the left</u>
<u n="394" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="395" who="S0082">side aisle</u>
<u n="396" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="398" who="S0084">oh okay</u>
<u n="399" who="S0082">it's the there's often a screen up</u>
<u n="400" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="401" who="S0082">um but I think if you look beyond the screen you can see um the font in there <pause dur="short"/> and that's for babies <pause dur="short"/> but for adults they tend to um um because it's you know it's Easter</u>
<u n="402" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="403" who="S0082">er Vigil is a big thing they do it all at the front by the altar</u>
<u n="404" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="405" who="S0082">um <pause dur="short"/> cos if they did it tucked away in a little  in a little  you know cubicle</u>
<u n="406" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="407" who="S0082">it wouldn't have the same effect really</u>
<u n="408" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="409" who="S0082">Cos it is a  it is a  community you know parish <trunc>c</trunc> community thing</u>
<u n="410" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="411" who="S0082">you know you want everybody at at mass to see what's going on</u>
