<u n="356" who="S0466">something like nobility yeah</u>
<u n="357" who="S0454">yeah and the servants like</u>
<u n="358" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="359" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I wonder where the servants live I don't really understand that</u>
<u n="360" who="S0466">er</u>
<u n="361" who="S0454">do you think they lived out? cos not all servants lived in did they?</u>
<u n="362" who="S0466">no</u>
<u n="363" who="S0454" trans="overlap">did doesn't really seem like there's a servant's room you know like servants' quarters</u>
<u n="364" who="S0466">no there was the room the bell comes the bells come through into the kitchen didn't they?</u>
<u n="365" who="S0454">yeah so that suggests actually</u>
<u n="366" who="S0466">they hang around</u>
<u n="367" who="S0454" trans="overlap">the servants didn't live in the building because in like Lanhydrock when we went there they had bells <trunc>i</trunc> the servants' quarters in the bedrooms</u>
<u n="368" who="S0466">oh yeah okay</u>
<u n="369" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so they'd know if they were ever needed</u>
<u n="370" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="371" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but yeah the only small bedrooms are the ones next to the bathrooms aren't they?</u>
<u n="372" who="S0466">yeah but then they seem a bit close</u>
<u n="373" who="S0454" trans="overlap">they're</u>
<u n="374" who="S0466" trans="overlap">to the family</u>
<u n="375" who="S0454">that's what I think I think they're too close</u>
<u n="376" who="S0466" trans="overlap">cos they're normally separated out</u>
<u n="377" who="S0454">yeah and then it's obvious the stables have never been converted into rooms</u>
<u n="378" who="S0466">mm mm and there's the coal shed but that wouldn't have been a room that's</u>
<u n="379" who="S0454">no</u>
<u n="380" who="S0466" trans="overlap">I think that's pretty much a coal shed</u>
<u n="381" who="S0454">yeah so I don't think they did live in they probably</u>
<u n="382" who="S0466" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="383" who="S0454" trans="overlap">lived in the village didn't they?</u>
<u n="384" who="S0466">yeah and then came up for day shifts</u>
<u n="385" who="S0454">yeah which is nice I guess they had a bit of privacy</u>
<u n="386" who="S0466">yeah <pause dur="short"/> have you do you have you watched Downton Abbey?</u>
<u n="387" who="S0454">no</u>
<u n="388" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="389" who="S0454">I keep meaning to watch it though</u>
<u n="390" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it is good I that's a shame I've probably just deleted all the</u>
<u n="391" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="392" who="S0466">copies I had I was running out of space I need a bigger hard drive</u>
<u n="393" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="394" who="S0466">but it's very good and you can get it on like Netflix or</u>
<u n="395" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="396" who="S0466" trans="overlap">one of those things</u>
<u n="397" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah yeah I should yeah I meant to download loads of stuff on my laptop before I left but I haven't whoops</u>
<u n="398" who="S0466" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="399" who="S0454">never mind</u>
<u n="400" who="S0466">no it's really good I've watched all of them quite addictive</u>
<u n="401" who="S0454">yeah I got a bit <trunc>in</trunc> more into TV this time cos I I watched erm</u>
<u n="402" who="S0466">what in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="403" who="S0454" trans="overlap">all of Humans did you watch that?</u>
<u n="404" who="S0466">oh I just saw an advert on a bus was it Channel Four?</u>
<u n="405" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="406" who="S0466">no I haven't seen it what's it about?</u>
<u n="407" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it's finished though</u>
<u n="408" who="S0466">oh I could get it on 4OD anyway</u>
<u n="409" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh okay there's only like six episodes</u>
<u n="410" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="411" who="S0454">so it's quite cool because a lot of sci-fi focuses on technology</u>
<u n="412" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="413" who="S0454">and it's a bit sort of techy isn't it? but this is quite cool cos it focuses on the humans</u>
<u n="414" who="S0466">uhu</u>
<u n="415" who="S0454">and their reaction to technology so it's basically about androids that they're robots but they <trunc>lo</trunc> they've been designed to look exactly like humans</u>
<u n="416" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="417" who="S0454">so yeah and the</u>
<u n="418" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that's <trunc>goo</trunc></u>
<u n="419" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so the father you know the typical family the mum's really busy she hasn't got really time to do everything the house is a mess</u>
<u n="420" who="S0466">uhu</u>
<u n="421" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and they never get to spend time together</u>
<u n="422" who="S0466">uhu</u>
<u n="423" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so the father without speaking to his wife like goes out</u>
<u n="424" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="425" who="S0454">and buys this robot</u>
<u n="426" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="427" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and the kids are really excited the little kid's really excited and of course the robot comes home and does everything brilliantly</u>
<u n="428" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="429" who="S0454" trans="overlap">like everything's clean she works out how they like their coffee and she remembers it</u>
<u n="430" who="S0466">okay</u>
<u n="431" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and just everything's perfect and the wife reacts really badly of course cos she feels</u>
<u n="432" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah that's fair enough yeah</u>
<u n="433" who="S0454">she doesn't have like a purpose</u>
<u n="434" who="S0466">okay</u>
<u n="435" who="S0454" trans="overlap">in the house and she objects to it and then the teenage daughter's really anti robots just on principle so she hates it</u>
<u n="436" who="S0466">right</u>
<u n="437" who="S0454">and tries to hack it and is like</u>
<u n="438" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="439" who="S0454" trans="overlap">basically abusing this robot except robots don't feel do they?</u>
<u n="440" who="S0466">no</u>
<u n="441" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so what's the problem?</u>
<u n="442" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="443" who="S0454">and then yeah the son ends up fancying her</u>
<u n="444" who="S0466">oh okay</u>
<u n="445" who="S0454" trans="overlap">like the fifteen-year-old son cos she's really beautiful</u>
<u n="446" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="447" who="S0454">er so he gets really upset about how it's being treated</u>
<u n="448" who="S0466">oh right okay</u>
<u n="449" who="S0454" trans="overlap">anyway yeah they get they take it back to the shop cos the family don't agree but the son gets so upset that he like chases after them and nearly dies in a car crash</u>
<u n="450" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="451" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but somehow the robot saves them</u>
<u n="452" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that sounds quite good</u>
<u n="453" who="S0454">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="454" who="S0466" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="455" who="S0454">so this it's nice it's looking at the human side and then it turns out it's not a normal robot it's one of like only five in the world where they're sentient and they can feel</u>
<u n="456" who="S0466">oh it's like a</u>
<u n="457" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so they're like yeah</u>
<u n="458" who="S0466"><vocal desc="gasp"/> oh</u>
<u n="459" who="S0454" trans="overlap">they've been abusing this robot so then</u>
<u n="460" who="S0466" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="461" who="S0454">how does that change the dynamic? that's like a person</u>
<u n="462" who="S0466" trans="overlap">quite different</u>
<u n="463" who="S0454">yeah no the police are after them</u>
<u n="464" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="465" who="S0454">why are they after them? yeah it's quite cool</u>
<u n="466" who="S0466">oh I I wanna watch that</u>
<u n="467" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and I like the fact that they focus on the human relationships</u>
<u n="468" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="469" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah cos it's different it's very few things have done that have they?</u>
<u n="470" who="S0466"><trunc>ye</trunc> that's right one film though which if you like that you'd like we watched it</u>
<u n="471" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="472" who="S0466">at the beginning of the year it's called Ex Machina</u>
<u n="473" who="S0454">oh okay</u>
<u n="474" who="S0466">and it was quite similar it's erm <pause dur="short"/> no it's different but it's it's a new robot it's been developing its artificial intelligence</u>
<u n="475" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="476" who="S0466">this guy and and he gets and employed for his company to fly out</u>
<u n="477" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="478" who="S0466">and he just <trunc>j</trunc>just to interact with it for a week</u>
<u n="479" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="480" who="S0466">to test it</u>
<u n="481" who="S0454">okay</u>
<u n="482" who="S0466">erm but it's smart it's a bit like that you know it's self-learning and so on</u>
<u n="483" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="484" who="S0466">and it's really <trunc>interest</trunc> just I won't ruin the story but following their interaction and</u>

<u n="487" who="S0454">oh</u>
<u n="488" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and but it was all the machine was very clever cos the machine didn't fall in love back but imitated falling in love back</u>
<u n="489" who="S0454">right</u>
<u n="490" who="S0466">as a ploy to escape</u>
<u n="491" who="S0454">oh</u>
<u n="492" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it's a very clever erm</u>
<u n="493" who="S0454">that's clever</u>
<u n="494" who="S0466" trans="overlap">show how the machines you know are one or two steps ahead and</u>

<u n="540" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="541" who="S0454">so that was</u>
<u n="542" who="S0466" trans="overlap">but they they had to be a really high</u>
<u n="543" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="544" who="S0466" trans="overlap">success rate</u>
<u n="545" who="S0454">they went really really high to to make it work and then of those three couples one pulled out before the marriage</u>
<u n="546" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="547" who="S0454">cos the girl kind of got cold feet and her family didn't approve so she was <trunc>th</trunc>that was out</u>

<u n="552" who="S0466" trans="overlap">at all yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="553" who="S0454">so then there were two couples left and they did go through with it but yeah one was disastrous and</u>
<u n="554" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="555" who="S0454" trans="overlap">there was the the husband he just stopped communicating with her it was just all an act</u>
<u n="556" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="557" who="S0454" trans="overlap">like the wedding looked really good and it looked like they were getting on in the honeymoon</u>
<u n="558" who="S0466">then he just</u>
<u n="559" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but then he just</u>
<u n="560" who="S0466" trans="overlap">went back to his true self</u>
<u n="561" who="S0454" trans="overlap">as soon as yeah and then it turned out</u>

<u n="563" who="S0454">he was like on Tinder looking</u>
<u n="564" who="S0466"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh no</u>

<u n="569" who="S0454">and they never even said goodbye</u>
<u n="570" who="S0466">oh okay</u>
<u n="571" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so that was really bad</u>
<u n="572" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="573" who="S0454">and then the other couple got on fine and they were still together at the end after five weeks and they</u>
<u n="574" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh really?</u>
<u n="575" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that's how they ended it</u>
<u n="576" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="577" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I think that was the last one in the series</u>
<u n="578" who="S0466">wow</u>
<u n="579" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but I guess they'll do another series it is quite cool because</u>
<u n="580" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="581" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you know in the Middle East like arranged marriage is</u>
<u n="582" who="S0466" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="583" who="S0454" trans="overlap">still the way it's done but it's not erm blind like that normally</u>
<u n="584" who="S0466">okay</u>
<u n="585" who="S0454" trans="overlap">like they do normally meet like normally it's the parents and the brothers and the sisters are out kind of looking for a man like the girl will say I wanna get married</u>
<u n="586" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="587" who="S0454">and then they'll all kind of look for someone suitable amongst their network</u>
<u n="588" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="589" who="S0454">you know like someone's cousin or a friend of a friend</u>
<u n="590" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="591" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and then they kind of vet him like secretly from afar so they'll like ask questions</u>
<u n="592" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="593" who="S0454">and then</u>
<u n="594" who="S0466" trans="overlap">if they're <unclear/></u>
<u n="595" who="S0454" trans="overlap">if it's all okay then they invite him to the house and the girl's invited into the room and they <trunc>usu</trunc> this normally in very strict families they wouldn't even get that but yeah they'll get a chance to kind of talk and then</u>
<u n="596" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="597" who="S0454">in more modern families they might be allowed to communicate by email or even phone</u>
<u n="598" who="S0466">oh okay</u>
<u n="599" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but generally not in the Gulf</u>
<u n="600" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="601" who="S0454">and yeah but she's still allowed to say no she can</u>
<u n="602" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="603" who="S0454" trans="overlap">even when they meet she could say</u>
<u n="604" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it's</u>
<u n="605" who="S0454">I don't like him so it's not a forced marriage</u>
<u n="606" who="S0466" trans="overlap">find another one yeah</u>
<u n="607" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah and then they'll just bring another one and that can go on for ages</u>
<u n="608" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="609" who="S0454">but what's a bit nasty in the Gulf is it's linked with money</u>
<u n="610" who="S0466">I was gonna say I think inevitably it's gonna be linked to status and money</u>
<u n="611" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so well there's dowry payments so</u>
<u n="612" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="613" who="S0454" trans="overlap">the guy has to actually pay and the</u>
<u n="614" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="615" who="S0454">the girls like for whatever reason or maybe it's the family I'm never quite sure go for the highest bidder</u>
<u n="616" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="617" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so then that's nasty</u>
<u n="618" who="S0466">that's not good</u>
<u n="619" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that becomes something else then</u>
<u n="620" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="621" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but I I don't like that idea it's not about them as a person</u>
<u n="622" who="S0466">no I think if it's arranged like that but not to do with money</u>
<u n="623" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="624" who="S0466">you know I can kind of understand it working cos it happens all the time you introduce friends oh you'll get on great with this person</u>
<u n="625" who="S0454">yeah I think you do it informally anyway</u>
<u n="626" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and it can you often pull people together</u>
<u n="627" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="628" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="629" who="S0454">yeah and it's not forced that she can say no but yeah the money thing I think I've talked to a lot of guys about that and then said oh you know I'm gonna get engaged and then it wouldn't work out and I'd say why and they would say it was usually the money they just</u>
<u n="630" who="S0466" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="631" who="S0454">asked for so much like they're really greedy</u>
<u n="632" who="S0466">who and who gets the money the family?</u>
<u n="633" who="S0454">the bride gets it</u>
<u n="634" who="S0466">the bride?</u>
<u n="635" who="S0454">but I wonder how much is actually given back to her parents</u>
<u n="636" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="637" who="S0454">yeah it seems quite dodgy</u>
<u n="638" who="S0466" trans="overlap">cos if the bride gets it and then they get married don't they have fifty fifty anyway?</u>
<u n="639" who="S0454">no it's all hers</u>
<u n="640" who="S0466">oh they get sort of <unclear>put away</unclear></u>
<u n="641" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah so that's kind of <trunc>wi</trunc> cos in the past when there was no welfare state if they were divorced or if the husband died</u>
<u n="642" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="643" who="S0454">she would have been left penniless</u>
<u n="644" who="S0466">oh yeah with nothing</u>
<u n="645" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and possibly with kids to bring up so that was her way of</u>
<u n="646" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it's a security</u>
<u n="647" who="S0454" trans="overlap">her way of surviving</u>
<u n="648" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="649" who="S0454">like a divorce but nowadays that doesn't make sense because there</u>
<u n="650" who="S0466" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="651" who="S0454">there is welfare and the state wouldn't let you know you starve to death</u>
<u n="652" who="S0466">no</u>
<u n="653" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but yeah the money's hers it whatever happens</u>
<u n="654" who="S0466">oh <trunc>ri</trunc> no it seems so weird though like it's well paying</u>
<u n="655" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it's not it doesn't in the past</u>
<u n="656" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and then to the highest bidder that's kind of weird</u>
<u n="657" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah it had a reason but now it just seems to be like money grabbing for money's sake</u>
<u n="658" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="659" who="S0454">and then like the divorce rate's really really high in the Gulf</u>
<u n="660" who="S0466">is it?</u>
<u n="661" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and you're like yeah well that's part of the reason cos you went for the highest bidder not like</u>
<u n="662" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="663" who="S0454">the one who's gonna make you happy</u>
<u n="664" who="S0466">do you think that's do you think some people are just going for the money and then get the money and then get divorced cos they get to keep the money?</u>
<u n="665" who="S0454">I wonder about that</u>
<u n="666" who="S0466">some</u>
<u n="667" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="668" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and <unclear>they know</unclear> is it just doesn't work out and because you know</u>
<u n="669" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah I wonder that</u>
<u n="670" who="S0466" trans="overlap">they didn't go for the person they liked yeah</u>
<u n="671" who="S0454">and they don't get the chance to really get to know each other in most cases in the Gulf</u>
<u n="672" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="673" who="S0454">like it is literally like they walk in a room oh he looks nice</u>
<u n="674" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="675" who="S0454" trans="overlap">he's got quite a lot of money</u>
<u n="676" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="677" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and it's just done on that not like I mean I guess in an ideal world they'd get to like court wouldn't they?</u>
<u n="678" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="679" who="S0454">but yeah they weren't really allowed that</u>
<u n="680" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="681" who="S0454">I don't know if it will change the divorce rate is really high like</u>
<u n="682" who="S0466" trans="overlap">I'm surprised I didn't think it would be so cos</u>
<u n="683" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah you wouldn't think so and they never publish their divorce figures</u>
<u n="684" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="685" who="S0454">like but yeah it's crazy crazy high <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="686" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="687" who="S0454">yeah it's weird I reckon a lot of them though the family pressures them to get married the boys and the girls so they get married to keep them happy knowing they can get divorced within like a year or so</u>
<u n="688" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="689" who="S0454">and then they can kind of be with probably the person they've loved all their life you know they've got someone else in mind</u>
<u n="690" who="S0466">in the back of their mind</u>
<u n="691" who="S0454" trans="overlap">until they've done for the marriage then then they're not gonna be allowed to marry them</u>
<u n="692" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="693" who="S0454">I reckon that's what</u>
<u n="694" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and get the money</u>
<u n="695" who="S0454">really happens</u>
<u n="696" who="S0466">and the <unclear/></u>
<u n="697" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="698" who="S0466">that's a shame</u>
<u n="699" who="S0454">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah and there's a lot of cheating like it's really rife with the guy</u>
<u n="700" who="S0466" trans="overlap">men and women cheating or</u>
<u n="701" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I don't know about the women</u>
<u n="702" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="703" who="S0454">I don't think so with the woman cos yeah that would be really</u>
<u n="704" who="S0466">I can imagine that would be</u>
<u n="705" who="S0454">shameful</u>
<u n="706" who="S0466" trans="overlap">very yeah</u>
<u n="707" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and that yeah</u>
<u n="708" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah very</u>
<u n="709" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but with the men oh it's really awful</u>
<u n="710" who="S0466">oh okay</u>
<u n="711" who="S0454" trans="overlap">just</u>
<u n="712" who="S0466">just can't</u>
<u n="713" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but they don't love their wife they marry her for kind of family reasons and</u>
<u n="714" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="715" who="S0454">they don't really get on a lot of the time you know when</u>
<u n="716" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it's strange</u>
<u n="717" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="718" who="S0466" trans="overlap">living together</u>
<u n="719" who="S0454">and then they might not</u>
<u n="720" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it's strange isn't it?</u>
<u n="721" who="S0454" trans="overlap">want to get divorced because of the sort of stigma</u>
<u n="722" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="723" who="S0454">and maybe they've got loads of young kids</u>
<u n="724" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="725" who="S0454">yeah it's not very nice</u>
<u n="726" who="S0466">yeah a bit bizarre</u>
<u n="727" who="S0454">mm and then I suppose if you just segregate the sexes then you can't really expect people to have like a normal marriage afterwards you know?</u>
<u n="728" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that's true</u>
<u n="729" who="S0454">cos they don't know how to relate to each other</u>
<u n="730" who="S0466">oh cos they're segregated you mean just with social situations and yeah</u>
<u n="731" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah so then the first time they have a like a non-family member it's their wife if they've never spent time with</u>
<u n="732" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="733" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so then it's gonna be awkward isn't it?</u>
<u n="734" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yes it is very strange yeah</u>
<u n="735" who="S0454" trans="overlap">for both sides</u>
<u n="736" who="S0466">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="737" who="S0454">especially in the UAE where it's even more segregated at least in Oman secondary school education was mix</u>
<u n="738" who="S0466">oh is it?</u>
<u n="739" who="S0454">so even though they didn't really talk to each like you must</u>
<u n="740" who="S0466" trans="overlap">at least see they you were around them</u>
<u n="741" who="S0454" trans="overlap">passively like have to like observe and see like okay they're not aliens and</u>
<u n="742" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="743" who="S0454">you know there'd be something wouldn't there?</u>
<u n="744" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="745" who="S0454">but yeah if you don't even have that</u>
<u n="746" who="S0466">that is strange</u>
<u n="747" who="S0454">yeah then you've yeah it must be really weird</u>
<u n="748" who="S0466">yeah the money thing's weird I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had to pay some payment like a a dowry er with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> getting engaged</u>
<u n="749" who="S0454">really?</u>
<u n="750" who="S0466">yeah</u>

<u n="754" who="S0466" trans="overlap">the the the dad</u>
<u n="755" who="S0454">maybe it's a West African thing</u>
<u n="756" who="S0466">yeah the dad wanted a farm but he ended up buying a herd of cows instead something like that so maybe it's more</u>
<u n="757" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="758" who="S0466">it's not like you have to give me this but it's probably maybe good practice to get a like a gift or something</u>
<u n="759" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh that's really interesting isn't it?</u>
<u n="760" who="S0466">yeah I'm <trunc>su</trunc> <trunc>sh</trunc>she told me that and I don't think she was joking</u>

<u n="766" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it really is</u>
<u n="767" who="S0454" trans="overlap">outdated practice</u>

<u n="770" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="771" who="S0454">very interesting</u>
<u n="772" who="S0466">it's funny in life though how much like cos you think we don't live in like split society of money or whatever and everything's equal and all that</u>
<u n="773" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="774" who="S0466">but really it's not like</u>

<u n="869" who="S0454">yeah pity but also that we're quite we're not very good at letting older people move sideways into new jobs even though we work for so much longer <pause dur="short"/> like there's not many jobs where they actively encourage older people to retrain</u>
<u n="870" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="871" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and they need to teaching is one of the few where they will be quite happy to see someone who's worked in say engineering move across into teaching</u>
<u n="872" who="S0466" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="873" who="S0454">and they think that adds something but most</u>
<u n="874" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="875" who="S0454">it's gonna be impossible for you</u>
<u n="876" who="S0466">yeah</u>

<u n="901" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="902" who="S0466" trans="overlap">designing buildings <trunc>n</trunc> you can't get in</u>

<u n="908" who="S0466">it's strange</u>
<u n="909" who="S0454">it is weird</u>
<u n="910" who="S0466">I don't see the need <unclear>I think an</unclear> engineer yeah they'll have to catch up and stuff but</u>
<u n="911" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="912" who="S0466" trans="overlap">you've still got the same core skills</u>
<u n="913" who="S0454">yeah it's very narrow</u>
<u n="914" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="915" who="S0454">mm <pause dur="short"/> so do you think you'll stay in engineering?</u>
<u n="916" who="S0466">I don't think forever no</u>
<u n="917" who="S0454">no cos you've got your business ideas</u>
<u n="918" who="S0466"><vocal desc="cough"/> no I don't have any ideas at the moment that's the problem</u>
<u n="919" who="S0454">oh</u>
<u n="920" who="S0466"><vocal desc="laugh"/> like property and stuff but</u>
<u n="921" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah you should talk to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I think cos kind of someone who's been successful and</u>
<u n="922" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="923" who="S0454" trans="overlap">moved out of a good career</u>

<u n="926" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="927" who="S0454">and did something he</u>
<u n="928" who="S0466" trans="overlap">something he was more passionate about</u>
<u n="929" who="S0454">exactly he was more passionate about</u>
<u n="930" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah that's the issue it's like I <trunc>qui</trunc> I like my job and stuff I'm not that passionate and I want</u>
<u n="931" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="932" who="S0466" trans="overlap">I want a job that I'm quite passionate about</u>
<u n="933" who="S0454">mm I mean I guess ideally you want <unclear>make like</unclear> consulting but that takes years before you can get to that point doesn't it?</u>
<u n="934" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="935" who="S0454">that's the ideal world where you don't really work that long on projects</u>
<u n="936" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="937" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and then you just take six months off</u>
<u n="938" who="S0466">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="939" who="S0454" trans="overlap">go and live somewhere cheap but yeah that's not easy to arrange</u>
<u n="940" who="S0466">no so I think sometimes I do really like engineering and I think like oh that could be quite good and</u>
<u n="941" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="942" who="S0466">enjoy it but then other times like I think my core engineering isn't as good as it could be but I think it's just cos I'm not that interested in like doing all the maths and stuff</u>
<u n="943" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="944" who="S0466">you know er yeah I think I'll certainly keep going for another few years</u>
<u n="945" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="946" who="S0466">I think <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>might do that</unclear> business idea and kick start it off in the background part time</u>
<u n="947" who="S0454">mm yeah that's a good idea</u>
<u n="948" who="S0466" trans="overlap"><unclear/> I think sort of thing</u>
<u n="949" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah that's the way to do it isn't it?</u>
<u n="950" who="S0466">uhu</u>
<u n="951" who="S0454" trans="overlap">start it off and see how it goes and then</u>

<u n="965" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="966" who="S0466" trans="overlap">I had someone in the canteen a few weeks ago and he drove me nuts he was so annoying he was like <pause dur="short"/> he was he was from Scotland and er he was basically trying to show off at the table he I wasn't eating with him he was on the next table about how like he's he he built he built it himself you know it was it was him he did it er but basically <vocal desc="laugh"/> this is the story is he went to private school his mummy and daddy gave him they paid for his backpacking afterwards</u>
<u n="967" who="S0454">oh come on</u>
<u n="968" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and bought him and paid for the deposit he was like yeah after that I just did it all myself and that's what I want for my kids it's like most people don't have that <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's ridiculous</u>
<u n="969" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah that is ridiculous</u>

<u n="971" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="972" who="S0466" trans="overlap">I mean we we're lucky too cos we got through uni and most people don't</u>
<u n="973" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="974" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and yeah but some people have handouts for a long time like you know for property bought for them</u>
<u n="975" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="976" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that sort of thing yeah</u>
<u n="977" who="S0454">that's true</u>
<u n="978" who="S0466">I don't think that's needed but yeah it's quite a split world isn't it?</u>
<u n="979" who="S0454">yeah it is and it's getting worse like the rich get richer and the</u>
<u n="980" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="981" who="S0454">well I don't know if the poor get poorer but definitely the rich and the poor the when you look at graphs</u>
<u n="982" who="S0466" trans="overlap">splitting</u>
<u n="983" who="S0454">and it's not just the UK is it? like the US is terrible</u>
<u n="984" who="S0466">oh the US is awful oh well especially the whole top one percent thing</u>
<u n="985" who="S0454">yeah I don't know what they can do about that</u>
<u n="986" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="987" who="S0454">I mean cos they'd say if you tax them more then they'll just go elsewhere</u>
<u n="988" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="989" who="S0454">which is always a risk</u>
<u n="990" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="991" who="S0454">too bad</u>
<u n="992" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="993" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="994" who="S0466">it's erm I think it's only set to get worse because</u>
<u n="995" who="S0454">I think so</u>
<u n="996" who="S0466">if the</u>
<u n="997" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it feels like it whenever there's a credit crunch the rich never</u>
<u n="998" who="S0466" trans="overlap">seem to do well</u>
<u n="999" who="S0454" trans="overlap">really suffer in fact if anything they do better</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0466" trans="overlap">cos you</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0454">more people renting</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0466" trans="overlap">cos they take advantage of</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0454">or like you know yeah <trunc>t</trunc>take advantage of people like okay your house is being</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0466" trans="overlap">or the situation</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0454" trans="overlap">repossessed</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0466">get it on the cheap you can afford to invest and</u>

<u n="1008" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0454">that's right</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0454">it's a good time to invest</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0454">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's true</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0466">yeah but I think well with technology there are two trains of thought one is that well we won't have to do any kind of boring manual work great that'll all be provided for free but the other train of thought which I think is more true is that those who can own the machines and the technology will do really well cos they don't need to employ people</u>
<u n="1015" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1016" who="S0466" trans="overlap">but then there <trunc>w</trunc> then there would be no jobs there'd be no low skilled jobs</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0454">and that's <trunc>w</trunc> in a way has already happened</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and that's happened you look at an</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0454" trans="overlap">there's</u>
<u n="1020" who="S0466" trans="overlap">an Amazon warehouse they're</u>
<u n="1021" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0466">you know</u>
<u n="1023" who="S0454" trans="overlap">or Swindon with the car factories where</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1025" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you used to employ like hundreds of people and now it employs like less than ten on a shift and it's</u>
<u n="1026" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it's crazy</u>
<u n="1027" who="S0454" trans="overlap">these massive robots and that's been going on for ages</u>
<u n="1028" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1029" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but I remember going in there and them showing us</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0454">and it is really impressive it's not men any more like standing in a line and doing one thing after another</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0466">it's just a machine</u>
<u n="1033" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it's just a machine doing it</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and someone operating it</u>
<u n="1036" who="S0466">it's inevitable but yeah only the rich corporations or rich people can own these machines or <unclear/></u>
<u n="1037" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah but then what happens? like mass unemployment</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0466">yeah then there's the few people CEOs as you see get paid you know five hundred million a year</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0466" trans="overlap">or whatever stupid sums and there's just this huge yeah and I think with technology anyway well the likes of all these web companies and stuff</u>
<u n="1041" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1042" who="S0466" trans="overlap">they they basically have a market that reaches the whole world</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0466" trans="overlap">the CEO of you know Facebook</u>

<u n="1046" who="S0466" trans="overlap">er say <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0454">yeah it's interesting you wonder what will happen</u>
<u n="1048" who="S0466">it's so global it just needs like one person and you can sell that for <unclear/></u>
<u n="1049" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1050" who="S0466">they were rich enough to invest or wise enough <pause dur="short"/> yeah I don't know</u>
<u n="1051" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I don't</u>
<u n="1052" who="S0466">I don't know what'll happen don't see it getting much better</u>
<u n="1053" who="S0454">no although at the moment labour is cheap enough in some parts of the world that the technology although it's there</u>
<u n="1054" who="S0466">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0454"><trunc>ma</trunc> it means not <trunc>we</trunc> yeah like in the Middle East they could mechanise a lot of stuff but they don't because they know</u>
<u n="1056" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="1057" who="S0454">it's cheaper to have the man go and turn the sprinkler on and off</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0454" trans="overlap">three times a day</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0454" trans="overlap">than to have an automatic system</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0466">bother doing it</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0454" trans="overlap">with a timer</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0454">because that costs money and</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0466" trans="overlap">mad isn't it?</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that guy doesn't cost anything and he's replaceable</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0466">yeah well that's good for labour and if they're treated well</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0454">yeah I'm not sure they are</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0466">no I'm not sure they are</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0454">but yeah I guess that will take quite a long time before in some parts of the world</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0454">like people get replaced</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0466">mm I think our world like we've all we've all been used to living in a richer country for years</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0466">you know the western world but er I think that's gonna be it's going downhill well it already is I think</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0466" trans="overlap">cos I think well there's you know I think the only reason some of these countries have done well is through not exploiting but through use of cheaper labour or</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0454">yeah well yeah</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that's fine it's business</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0454" trans="overlap">definitely well Britain's definitely gone down</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah and it's got loads of <unclear/></u>
<u n="1083" who="S0454" trans="overlap">look at our manufacturing</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0466">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0454" trans="overlap">like our clothes are made in Bangladesh but</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0454" trans="overlap">we all know like they're not exactly getting minimum wage are they?</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0466" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and the safety conditions are terrible</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0466">but that advantage is disappearing</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0454">mm with mechanisation like</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0466">yeah yeah but also these countries so we you know we we used to be high tech and developing these things at high cost and making high profit that's been our model for</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0466">twenty years I suppose but now that that's gone as well</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and <unclear>China</unclear> can make the high tech stuff just as well so</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0466">and we've lost</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but China's yeah I see what</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0466" trans="overlap">lost our identity a little bit</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0454">but there's still a lot of developing countries China can't really be</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0454" trans="overlap">be called a developing country</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0466">oh no no no that's right</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0454" trans="overlap">in the past we used to say like developed developing</u>
<u n="1106" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1107" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but it's too simple now</u>
<u n="1108" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0454" trans="overlap">there's like things in between</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0466" trans="overlap">scale</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0454">or what do they call them? like the Brics or the Rics? the</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0466" trans="overlap">I think Brics</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0454" trans="overlap">like recently industrialised</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0466">Brazil Russia and India</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0466">yeah I mean</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so it's too simplistic</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0466" trans="overlap">Brics mm</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0454">yeah there's Ric and there's Bric isn't there? I think Bric is the</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0466" trans="overlap">what's Ric? recently industrialised country?</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah and then I think it includes Russia <pause dur="short"/> india China with the</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0466" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0454">and then</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and then there's Bric it's Brazil</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0454" trans="overlap">Brazil Brazil yeah</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0454">mm <pause dur="short"/> but I dunno like <pause dur="short"/> with farming there's always been two schools of thought about farming and overpopulation like if the world population keeps on increasing</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0454" trans="overlap">then we're gonna have mass famine</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0454" trans="overlap">because the world can only support X many people</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0466">yeah the <unclear/></u>
<u n="1135" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that's called the Malthus there was this guy called Malthusian principle says that</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0466">okay</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and then there's another school of thought and that's pretty old that's like hundreds of years old that guy's</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0466" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0454">er hundreds of years ago and then there's this other woman interestingly who came along you know eighteen hundreds and said that's wrong</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0454" trans="overlap">Boserup this is and she said technology necessity is the mother of all invention</u>
<u n="1142" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="1143" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and technology will surpass every time the the like the world gets to its carrying capacity for food versus</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0466">oh it resolves it</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0454" trans="overlap">population it will resolve itself because it's a necessity and that will breed innovation and to date</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0466" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0454">she's probably been right like India was said to have this mass famine according to the Malthusian model</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0466">okay</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0454">and it never ever happened</u>
<u n="1150" who="S0466">they managed to</u>
<u n="1151" who="S0454" trans="overlap">because the green revolution came along and then they had all these like dwarf varieties of wheat which</u>
<u n="1152" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="1153" who="S0454" trans="overlap">grew much quicker and they had</u>
<u n="1154" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0454" trans="overlap">fertiliser and they had this and it's not without problems cos they've also had pollution</u>
<u n="1156" who="S0466">yeah and and we innovating now with GM and everything</u>
<u n="1157" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah exactly and now</u>
<u n="1158" who="S0466" trans="overlap">I mean you can do you can grow meat</u>
<u n="1159" who="S0454">yeah so we've got the this was the green revolution and now they're calling this one the G revolution</u>
<u n="1160" who="S0466">ah okay</u>
<u n="1161" who="S0454">but the inevitably there'll be something else won't there?</u>
<u n="1162" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1163" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and all of these have problems but we've never reached a point of global starvation and I don't think we ever will because look at like the capacity you have even in cities for urban farming which people are experimenting with like</u>
<u n="1164" who="S0466">ah</u>
<u n="1165" who="S0454">using rooftops to grow food or warehouses there's such a lot of empty space</u>
<u n="1166" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah the city could almost be self-sustaining</u>
<u n="1167" who="S0454">it could like</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0466" trans="overlap">almost</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0454">if you look at the rafters</u>
<u n="1170" who="S0466" trans="overlap">there's a lot of space</u>
<u n="1171" who="S0454">you know in houses like everyone's got that space for nothing</u>
<u n="1172" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1173" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and that could grow mushrooms say</u>
<u n="1174" who="S0466">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="1175" who="S0454">or water where you know the Japanese have much more intensively done aquaculture</u>
<u n="1176" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and grown mussels and oysters</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0454">on just little rafts</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0466" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0454" trans="overlap">floating on the sea but the turnover is phenomenal like so if you just wanted to produce protein</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0466">you could could you?</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0454">you could in a very small body of seawater</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0454">so yeah</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0454">I kind of feel like we'll never reach carrying capacity and it's nonsense to only talk about farmland disappearing</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0466">space yeah</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0454">because even in the desert now with like where there's no soil it's all like hydroponics right?</u>
<u n="1190" who="S0466">right</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0454">and it's cheap it is economical like there a bunch of herbs is ten P here you'll pay at least one pound fifty for the same bunch</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0466">oh right</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and that's grown in soil so</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh that's interesting</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0454">there there is a kind of</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you know it's not an economic argument to say that it can't be done</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0466">no you put yourself I think by using technology like all hydroponics and stuff</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0466">the risk is that you you put yourself in quite a precarious <trunc>s</trunc> like food <trunc>securit</trunc> like food is available I mean but it's more precarious like it's reliant on technology</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1202" who="S0466" trans="overlap">so if one's er something going wrong everything falls down <trunc>s</trunc> kind of thing</u>
<u n="1203" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1204" who="S0466">whereas if we're just growing on farmland it's not really interconnected and so on</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0454">but it's interconnected in other ways like bad weather</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0454" trans="overlap">whereas you could say in a greenhouse</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0466">yeah <vocal desc="cough"/> true you can control that</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that can be more controlled so you</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you don't really have a a bad weather year</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0466">no</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0454" trans="overlap">where the apples fail but</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but yeah I guess technology could fail and the greenhouse I dunno</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0454">breaks or whatever and like yeah and obviously</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0454">in the desert that would be disastrous if your cooling system didn't work</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0454">then it can't be done</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0454">but it is amazing</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0466" trans="overlap">see you're more</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0454">the</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0466" trans="overlap">like mm</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0454" trans="overlap">the greenhouses now we've got in the UK like East Anglia they grow them like vertically tomatoes</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0454">and it's just phenomenal like the turnover</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0466">and how quick they can do it</u>
<u n="1231" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1232" who="S0466">oh wow</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0454">yeah like just masses and masses and like</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that's cool that</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0454" trans="overlap">machines for harvesting as well</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0466">very well yeah industrial farming's been industrial for ages</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0454">yeah it has in a way it was probably the first thing that got industrialised wasn't it?</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1239" who="S0454">but we're still dealing with the fallout from that</u>
<u n="1240" who="S0466">in what what way?</u>
<u n="1241" who="S0454">like farm farmers not making money</u>
<u n="1242" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0454">and like</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="1245" who="S0454">yeah it got so cheap to mass produce that</u>
<u n="1246" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah I see what you mean</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0454" trans="overlap">small farmers got pushed out</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0454">and it's now just sort of big agro business isn't it?</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0466">yeah yeah huge interesting there's erm I don't know where I saw this it was on TV some documentary er about the human race the human brain</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1252" who="S0466">and it periods in history where it's known there's been a huge issue like the ice age or you know a huge a threat to the human race they found that the human brain erm or the skull has increased in size</u>
<u n="1253" who="S0454">oh that's interesting</u>
<u n="1254" who="S0466" trans="overlap">there's there's a direct correlation</u>
<u n="1255" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1256" who="S0466" trans="overlap">so it's an increase er well they think an increase in brain power essentially so when you need to survive when there's a</u>
<u n="1257" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0466" trans="overlap">real threat your brain kind of accommodates it and it gets bigger and they get more intelligent</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that makes sense that's very Boserup kind of</u>
<u n="1260" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh is it?</u>
<u n="1261" who="S0454">extended</u>
<u n="1262" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah yeah like yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="1263" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you know idea about necessity and invention but also a necessity in evolution yeah I remember reading</u>
<u n="1264" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it's quite interesting</u>
<u n="1265" who="S0454">you know traditionally we thought of evolution happening very slowly which it probably does</u>
<u n="1266" who="S0466">but it might be more spurts</u>
<u n="1267" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but there seems to be yeah it seems to be that the main like mutations have actually occurred when a serious threat's occurred</u>
<u n="1268" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh really? so there's a theme there?</u>
<u n="1269" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1270" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1271" who="S0454">which makes sense doesn't it?</u>
<u n="1272" who="S0466">I don't know does it? I don't know how does that fit into random mutations though?</u>
<u n="1273" who="S0454" trans="overlap">cos there are always random mutations but</u>
<u n="1274" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1275" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but perhaps there's no advantage to having</u>
<u n="1276" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh that's true</u>
<u n="1277" who="S0454">a random mutation so there's no reason for it to be selected naturally selected</u>
<u n="1278" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that's true but when there's a threat</u>
<u n="1279" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but if say there was a threat</u>
<u n="1280" who="S0466">ah</u>
<u n="1281" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and you randomly mutated and that one's smarter</u>
<u n="1282" who="S0466">yes</u>
<u n="1283" who="S0454">then you're more likely to get through that and there'll be a sort of bottleneck where</u>
<u n="1284" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that's true</u>
<u n="1285" who="S0454">anyone who's a bit thicker and couldn't work out how to do it</u>
<u n="1286" who="S0466">doesn't get through</u>
<u n="1287" who="S0454" trans="overlap">dies off</u>
<u n="1288" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1289" who="S0454">yeah that kind of makes sense to me</u>
<u n="1290" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that makes sense and if let's say you know seventy percent of the population died during those threats</u>
<u n="1291" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1292" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that makes a lot of sense cos the the thirty percent with that mutation will go through and then suddenly that's a whole <unclear>clean</unclear> population</u>
<u n="1293" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0466" trans="overlap">that's like succeeded right?</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah no it makes sense to me</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it does make sense yeah</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm a kind of bottleneck like an evolutionary bottleneck</u>
<u n="1298" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0466">I did my dissertation on genetic algorithms</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0454">did you?</u>
<u n="1302" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1303" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh oh that's cool</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0466">really interesting it was</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0466">it was on so genetic algorithm is a <pause dur="short"/> an algorithm but you it's basically it's a you have a problem you want to solve if</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1308" who="S0466">you let the computer solve it through natural selection</u>
<u n="1309" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0466">of the population of random initial solutions</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0466">erm that's er er so that's cool so you kind of have to <trunc>c</trunc> <unclear>clone</unclear> your chromosome and stuff so I I I was interested so was my lecturer on how it how you could apply it to civil engineering problems so</u>
<u n="1313" who="S0454">oh</u>
<u n="1314" who="S0466">they're normally multi-objective or multi erm yeah multi-objective problems</u>
<u n="1315" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0466">where like there's no just simple formula</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0466">so I thought what's a good one? and I thought well tidal turbines</u>
<u n="1319" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1320" who="S0466">but a tidal of <unclear/> so a whole fleet of thirty underwater wind turbines basically</u>
<u n="1321" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0466">and there are so many factors in what in what essentially is a profitable one it would be the speed of the water the interaction on one to another</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0466" trans="overlap">local effects even the length of cabling that you need so <trunc>m</trunc> it's such a</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0466" trans="overlap">complex thing and and they all interact with each other so it was a really good one so <trunc>y</trunc> so I had the gene was just made up of I think it was just the turbine the X on my coordinates and that's all you needed</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0466">so so the software generation number one just created a whole load of random coordinates and just stuck a load of random turbines in the water</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0454">oh</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0466">then it would measure its fitness essentially through the mass that is what you can code is you know like cost of keeping it and all that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0466">and and it sorry its the first population would have a population of like say a hundred</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0466">and they would they would erm mutate</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0466">and reproduce</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0454">okay</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0466" trans="overlap">so the next one you'd pick it would <trunc>sor</trunc> would you pick the best? yeah you'd pick the top fifty percent</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0454">oh okay</u>
<u n="1340" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and then and then erm they'd breed together and then a one random mutation and then that <unclear>round</unclear> goes through to the next and so on and so on and so on</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0454">oh that's clever</u>
<u n="1342" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and it's cool cos you could watch it on the screen and the turbines would slowly move and they would slowly line up cos that was an optimum reduction in cabling then</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1344" who="S0466">or they'd space themselves apart so there's no interaction</u>
<u n="1345" who="S0454">wow</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0466">cool</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0454">that is cool</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0466">really neat yeah</u>
<event desc="sound of sirens"/>
<u n="1349" who="S0454">wow what's going on?</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0466">dunno sounds like a fire truck</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0454">yeah it does actually</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0466"><vocal desc="cough"/> yeah I found that interesting</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0454">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's cool <pause dur="short"/> yeah the food one interests me a lot but at the moment people talk about like the crisis but we're still throwing away so much food that</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0466" trans="overlap">well like a third or a fifth or</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah it's</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0466" trans="overlap">something</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0454" trans="overlap">some crazy statistic that</u>
<u n="1358" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it doesn't really make sense to talk about a food crisis erm in terms of production</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0466">no</u>
<u n="1361" who="S0454">there are other problems like distribution sure</u>
<u n="1362" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0454">like but that's a localised problem</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and maybe we've just got people erm in the wrong places really</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0454">you know if the climate's changing</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0466" trans="overlap">well maybe</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0454">and there's drought there then that area is no longer sort of able to support a human population naturally</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so we shouldn't have huge megacities like</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0466">yeah like</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0454" trans="overlap">Perth or something</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0466">right</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you know like that's gonna be</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0454">people need to move and it's only developed</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0454" trans="overlap">countries that can afford</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0454" trans="overlap">to keep people there</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0466" trans="overlap">if you've got the money</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0454" trans="overlap">whereas like say Sudan or something</u>
<u n="1384" who="S0466">they'd never live there</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0454">they need to move those people need to go somewhere</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0466"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1387" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but the problem is where do they go?</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0454">but it will happen naturally like migration</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0466">yeah and it does happen</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0454">and it is happening</u>
<u n="1392" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0454">the migrant crisis</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0454">and that will be interesting to see how we cope because refugee has a very narrow definition in law like what makes a refugee? but we're now getting the point where we've got environmental refugees like</u>
<u n="1398" who="S0466" trans="overlap">what's that?</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0454">er where</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh like fleeing from yeah</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0454" trans="overlap">for example your</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0466" trans="overlap">the conditions</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0454">yeah like low lying islands in the Pacific are actually being flooded</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0454" trans="overlap">because of local climate change but they don't actually <trunc>fi</trunc>fit our definition</u>
<u n="1406" who="S0466">no</u>
<u n="1407" who="S0454">of a refugee</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0466" trans="overlap">but I suppose they are though</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0454" trans="overlap">who have to be yes of course they are</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0466">they need <unclear/></u>
<u n="1411" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but the law needs to change to support that because then they could claim asylum</u>
<u n="1412" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1413" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I mean their homeland</u>
<u n="1414" who="S0466">because it's unsuitable to live</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0454" trans="overlap">has actually been destroyed</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0454">but that's an extreme example where you can show their home doesn't exist</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0454">like obviously they have to go</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0466" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1421" who="S0454" trans="overlap">somewhere else but what about where it becomes so dry or so hot</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0454">like at what point do you say this land is no <trunc>e</trunc> longer able to support the size of the population</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and people have to leave?</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0466">it's quite a hard definition quite multi</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0454">yeah exactly because it depends on a lot of factors doesn't it? like</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0454" trans="overlap">are you able to import food? so then it's about economy</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0454" trans="overlap">like it yeah</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0466">yeah cos otherwise you could claim asylum from Perth</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0454">right</u>
<u n="1434" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and it's couldn't you right?</u>
<u n="1435" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1436" who="S0466">although er although actually the government would provide everything</u>
<u n="1437" who="S0454">it would have to</u>
<u n="1438" who="S0466" trans="overlap">if you didn't have <unclear/></u>
<u n="1439" who="S0454" trans="overlap">determine it in terms of food security I suppose like</u>
<u n="1440" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1441" who="S0454">but then food security could be short term problem</u>
<u n="1442" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1443" who="S0454" trans="overlap">right like civil war but</u>
<u n="1444" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1445" who="S0454">but yeah I guess that's already covered under war the</u>
<u n="1446" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="1447" who="S0454">droughts aren't usually permanent they're cyclical so then at what point do you say like</u>
<u n="1448" who="S0466" trans="overlap">how long do you live through it or</u>
<u n="1449" who="S0454" trans="overlap">how long do they have to?</u>
<u n="1450" who="S0466" trans="overlap">should you have to <unclear>pay</unclear> for it?</u>
<u n="1451" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1452" who="S0466">or yeah</u>
<u n="1453" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1454" who="S0466">oh complex</u>
<u n="1455" who="S0454">it is yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm but urban farming I think that's a really important area like all of us should be developing like</u>
<u n="1456" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1457" who="S0454">it's still so small scale like Exeter's got this really cool project where they collect coffee grounds</u>
<u n="1458" who="S0466">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="1459" who="S0454">this company or charity I'm not sure which from like</u>
<u n="1460" who="S0466">yes</u>
<u n="1461" who="S0454" trans="overlap">from like coffee shops for free you know a lot of it and</u>
<u n="1462" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and get rid of the waste</u>
<u n="1463" who="S0454" trans="overlap">will give it for free and then they put into kind of like er sort of a sandbag kind of thing but a bit bigger</u>
<u n="1464" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="1465" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and they've cut holes in the side and</u>
<u n="1466" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="1467" who="S0454">they</u>
<u n="1468" who="S0466" trans="overlap">do you plant them?</u>
<u n="1469" who="S0454" trans="overlap">they plant the spores of oyster mushrooms in them and they just hang them on hooks in this kind of like warehouse</u>
<u n="1470" who="S0466">mm</u>
<u n="1471" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and then they grow and they sell those back</u>
<u n="1472" who="S0466">oh cool</u>
<u n="1473" who="S0454" trans="overlap">to supermarkets locally so that's really nice it's cyclical</u>
<u n="1474" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1475" who="S0454" trans="overlap">because their input material is just waste</u>
<u n="1476" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1477" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and their output is something they can sell</u>
<u n="1478" who="S0466">that's good so</u>
<u n="1479" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and it doesn't taste</u>
<u n="1480" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it pays for itself</u>
<u n="1481" who="S0454">yeah and as it happens they're using an empty warehouse but theoretically I guess you could use any dark place</u>
<u n="1482" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1483" who="S0454">like a ceiling in a house or</u>
<u n="1484" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh yeah? yeah</u>
<u n="1485" who="S0454">you know in a factory where there's like rafters and</u>
<u n="1486" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1487" who="S0454">you just need like to be able to walk around and be able to harvest them but yeah I guess you can't live off mushrooms but</u>
<u n="1488" who="S0466">no but you'd have many many things</u>
<u n="1489" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1490" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1491" who="S0454">I mean that's particularly good cos it doesn't need light I guess you don't have to make any conversions</u>
<u n="1492" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1493" who="S0454">to you know like most things</u>
<u n="1494" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1495" who="S0454" trans="overlap">would need light</u>
<u n="1496" who="S0466">that's true</u>
<u n="1497" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so it's not really practical to retrofit you know glass ceilings or whatever</u>
<u n="1498" who="S0466">no <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1499" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but lots of places have flat roofs don't they? like industrial units that potentially could be</u>
<u n="1500" who="S0466" trans="overlap">cool <unclear>ugly</unclear> as well</u>
<u n="1501" who="S0454">yeah a garden <pause dur="short"/> like schools often have flat roofs don't they?</u>
<u n="1502" who="S0466" trans="overlap">mm it's such a shame we don't use our roof spaces</u>
<u n="1503" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1504" who="S0466" trans="overlap">isn't it?</u>
<u n="1505" who="S0454">that's a waste isn't it?</u>
<u n="1506" who="S0466" trans="overlap">it's a huge space</u>
<u n="1507" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it's a really dead space</u>
<u n="1508" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1509" who="S0454">and then you see really cool houses like in Scandinavia where they grass over the roof</u>
<u n="1510" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh I like that</u>
<u n="1511" who="S0454">as insulation</u>
<u n="1512" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1513" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so it's a very thick layer of insulation</u>
<u n="1514" who="S0466">that's true</u>
<u n="1515" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah that's cool I really like that idea</u>
<u n="1516" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1517" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1518" who="S0466">in Korea they did use their roofs quite well there there would be gardens and stuff</u>
<u n="1519" who="S0454">oh that's good</u>
<u n="1520" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1521" who="S0454">yeah and in the Middle East they are you know</u>
<u n="1522" who="S0466" trans="overlap">have <unclear>pools</unclear> of</u>
<u n="1523" who="S0454" trans="overlap">built strong enough to not <unclear>pools</unclear> so much</u>
<u n="1524" who="S0466">oh</u>
<u n="1525" who="S0454">but they're strong enough that they put water tanks and stuff</u>
<u n="1526" who="S0466">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1527" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but they're strong you can walk on they're designed to be walked on</u>
<u n="1528" who="S0466">oh that's good</u>
<u n="1529" who="S0454" trans="overlap">whereas ours usually aren't are they?</u>
<u n="1530" who="S0466">no</u>
<u n="1531" who="S0454">but</u>
<u n="1532" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1533" who="S0454">yeah I guess we just need to but that's a huge amount of space isn't it?</u>
<u n="1534" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1535" who="S0454">and then there's this cool project in London I saw where they have a supermarket and they grow there's a community garden on the roof</u>
<u n="1536" who="S0466">oh right</u>
<u n="1537" who="S0454">and then they sell the produce downstairs in the supermarket</u>
<u n="1538" who="S0466">that's cool</u>
<u n="1539" who="S0454">so that's nice like really like zero</u>
<u n="1540" who="S0466" trans="overlap">local</u>
<u n="1541" who="S0454" trans="overlap">food miles</u>
<u n="1542" who="S0466">yeah</u>
<u n="1543" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1544" who="S0466">mm <pause dur="short"/> I hate erm there's so much waste with <pause dur="short"/> like people you know everybody wants a brand new kitchen every seven years</u>
<u n="1545" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1546" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and you'll so much waste <pause dur="short"/> I mean I did it as well in the flat but</u>
<u n="1547" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1548" who="S0466">so why it's a shame we can't reuse or recondition stuff a bit more</u>
<u n="1549" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1550" who="S0466">or put new fronts on rather than whole thing and all of that</u>
<u n="1551" who="S0454">it's true <pause dur="short"/> mm but you wonder if it's deliberate they make it like that</u>
<u n="1552" who="S0466" trans="overlap">oh it is</u>
<u n="1553" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so that they get more money</u>
<u n="1554" who="S0466">well Ikea</u>
<u n="1555" who="S0454" trans="overlap">if things were modular then</u>
<u n="1556" who="S0466" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1557" who="S0454">it <trunc>wou</trunc></u>
<u n="1558" who="S0466" trans="overlap">Ikea deliberately makes well they they basically converted the furniture market and made it something cos previously people who buy a nice wooden table and it would last</u>
<u n="1559" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="1560" who="S0466">like twenty years Ikea made it cheap and such that it's fashionable so therefore it's in fashion and then out of fashion like</u>
<u n="1561" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1562" who="S0466" trans="overlap">clothes right?</u>
<u n="1563" who="S0454">that is good yeah</u>
<u n="1564" who="S0466" trans="overlap">and then you have to even though they're not broken you're buying new ones every three years cos they're out of fashion</u>
<u n="1565" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1566" who="S0466" trans="overlap">they've done the same thing with their furniture</u>
<u n="1567" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1568" who="S0466"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="1569" who="S0454">that's true yeah</u>
<u n="1570" who="S0466" trans="overlap">you you look at old Ikea stuff from ten years ago it looks awful</u>
<u n="1571" who="S0454">yeah?</u>
<u n="1572" who="S0466" trans="overlap">doesn't stand up yeah</u>

<u n="1648" who="S0466">yeah</u>

<u n="1661" who="S0454">then it's not a big enough space to really carry it off</u>

<u n="1663" who="S0454">yeah that's true</u>
