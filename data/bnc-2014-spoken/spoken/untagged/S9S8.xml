<u n="1" who="S0255">are you tired?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0256"><vocal desc="yawn"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="3" who="S0255">how was this evening?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0256">yeah it was good it was alright we did learn to skate but we had to do the new warm up for the new course so that was interesting <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="5" who="S0255">what do you mean? what's the new warm up?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0256">erm the new course skate skate excellence which has taken the place of learn to skate we get to wear these jazzy boot covers and erm we have to do like a warm up with them so they get warmed up for their lesson basically that they have and then they have so much lesson time</u>
<u n="7" who="S0255">so what's the point of the boot covers?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0256">erm they've got like left and right on them and then they've got different colours to correspond with edges and things like that</u>
<u n="9" who="S0255">oh right so as you <trunc>ta</trunc> saying to warm up you sort of say</u>
<u n="10" who="S0256">you go onto your orange edges your yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0255">oh right</u>
<u n="12" who="S0256">but it's erm confuses me</u>
<u n="13" who="S0255"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0256">my brain it doesn't work that way so erm</u>
<u n="15" who="S0255"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0256">yeah I'm not finding it <vocal desc="laugh"/> the easiest</u>
<u n="17" who="S0255">oh never mind</u>
<u n="18" who="S0256">but er it's okay I'm sure I'll get it <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> seems to think I'll get it</u>
<u n="19" who="S0255">yeah you usually do it's just sometimes your brain takes a minute or two longer or a bit longer because of the left right thing as well doesn't it?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0256">yeah well they've got L and R on the boots and you have different coloured gloves on each hand for left and right</u>
<u n="21" who="S0255">yeah but left and right doesn't help you cos your brain thinks of left and as being the right one because</u>
<u n="22" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0255">that's the dominant one</u>
<u n="24" who="S0256">I know it just gets easily confused but er it'll be alright I suppose</u>
<u n="25" who="S0255">ah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0256">in the end I just I'm struggling with the idea of colours and doing things like that</u>
<u n="27" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah cos I suppose you just do a certain move without thinking of it as a colour so when you have to think what colour is that move</u>
<u n="28" who="S0256">yeah but it's also just the way that my brain learns things so it</u>
<u n="29" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0256">it erm I learn better from watching and having things broken down slowly</u>
<u n="31" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0256">than having <trunc>t</trunc> if you tell me to go into the tightrope position and then cross my leg and and make the orange edge <trunc>tou</trunc> edges touch</u>
<u n="33" who="S0255">yep</u>
<u n="34" who="S0256">that doesn't make sense to me whereas if you break it down and do the moves slowly and I'll watch it and then I get it and then I can do it</u>
<u n="35" who="S0255">mm so do you think do you find then with the people that are learning it on the learn to skate course do you spot the ones that are struggling and maybe try and show them how to do it?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0256" trans="overlap">well we've we've not got any actually doing it at the minute cos we've our level isn't doing it the girls we've got on our level</u>
<u n="37" who="S0255">oh right</u>
<u n="38" who="S0256">aren't actually doing it yet it's the new ones that are coming in that are starting it we just did the warm up with everybody cos they wanted to do it for some reason erm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0256">the problem is though you've gotta stick to the course you can't it's not as as easily adjustable as learn to skate because learn to skate you get told the move</u>
<u n="41" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="42" who="S0256">and then you teach the move the way that you teach it</u>
<u n="43" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0256">whereas this is now more you do this with the colours you go onto your orange <trunc>e</trunc> erm orange line and then you go onto your green line and stuff so we'll see I mean I've not actually had</u>
<u n="45" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0256">any experience of anybody learning it yet but we'll see</u>
<u n="47" who="S0255">yeah I suppose cos everybody learns things differently so that actually isn't necessarily gonna cater for everybody</u>
<u n="48" who="S0256">no it's very based for kids and it's</u>
<u n="49" who="S0255">oh</u>
<u n="50" who="S0256">it's been designed by a woman that's got dyslexia so for her it probably makes sense the whole way to learn but for me</u>
<u n="51" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0256">it's my idea of my nightmare way of learning cos I if you just tell me something so just <trunc>ha</trunc></u>
<u n="53" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="54" who="S0256">if you taught me how to do a for example er a a crossover and you said you take your left leg you push out you cross your left leg over your right leg</u>
<u n="55" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0256">hold your right leg under and you move it out</u>
<u n="57" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0256">er when I first learned wouldn't wouldn't be able to do it</u>
<u n="59" who="S0255">no cos for me by about the second bit of that being said I'm trying to think well hang on which is my right leg my which the left?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0255">er to to what? but what did you say?</u>
<u n="62" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah whereas if I watch it really slow</u>
<u n="63" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="64" who="S0256">then I get it which is</u>
<u n="65" who="S0255">yeah that's what I I tend to learn more like that</u>
<u n="66" who="S0256">yeah I said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> cos she didn't realise but it took me a good year to actually figure out what I was doing with my arms in the cool down er at at</u>
<u n="67" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0256">at <anon type="place"/> erm cos we do sort of lemons where you push your legs out and then bring em back together again which is simple</u>
<u n="69" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0256">but we do arms with it</u>
<u n="71" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0256">and I couldn't figure out which way I was doing my arms with my legs and it took me a good year to figure out I said most of the time I just waved my arms around</u>
<u n="73" who="S0255"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0256">just sort of bring them round cos er it's like <trunc>br</trunc>bringing them round your your body which I understand but I don't know whether I'm going in or whether I'm going out or</u>
<u n="75" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0256">what I'm doing and <trunc>wh</trunc>when I'm pushing out what I'm doing with my arms took me ages and she said why didn't you say something? I went ah I figured it out</u>
<u n="77" who="S0255">well yeah exactly</u>
<u n="78" who="S0256">just took a while</u>
<u n="79" who="S0255">and if she'd said oh you do this this and this you'd go <trunc>oka</trunc> but that actually wouldn't have made a lot of sense</u>
<u n="80" who="S0256">no</u>
<u n="81" who="S0255">so you just <trunc>w</trunc>wait until your arms were in sync</u>
<u n="82" who="S0256">I struggle with thinking out which way my arms</u>
<u n="83" who="S0255">with what everybody else's arms were doing <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0256">yeah my arm which way my arm goes across my body and <trunc>w</trunc> aware of what my legs are doing at the same time</u>
<u n="85" who="S0255"><vocal desc="yawn"/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0256">sorry</u>
<u n="87" who="S0255">oh sorry I'm tired</u>
<u n="88" who="S0256">I'm tired</u>

<u n="92" who="S0256">I know probably like aim for eightish eight half eight</u>
<u n="93" who="S0255">mm</u>

<u n="121" who="S0255">well that's how I do all of it now so I decided I need to buy some boots but before I started buying boots I saw there was twenty-five percent off on tops so I had to look at the tops</u>
<u n="122" who="S0256"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="123" who="S0255">because obviously there's twenty-five percent off on the tops er so I found a few tops and then I started thinking about er the boots but actually I want to get some new jeans to go with the boots so then I looked at all the jeans and</u>

Monday Tuesday Wednesday get it Wednesday and I get free returns so it's just like shopping at home it's like you go and rather than taking in armfuls of clothes to the changing rooms to try everything on I order this this this</u>
<u n="177" who="S0256">yeah but you do actually have to pay for them</u>
<u n="178" who="S0255">order a couple <trunc>o</trunc> no but you take it into the changing rooms try it all on and then decide what you're keeping then go to the till and pay for it</u>
<u n="179" who="S0256">mm</u>
<u n="180" who="S0255">this way this is my shop and I'm looking buying try like trying trying choose choose choose choose different sizes different colours if I think maybe cos the jeans some of them I'm not quite sure exactly what size then they'll all come I'll stand in the bedroom with <trunc>m</trunc> big floor to ceiling mirror things on the wardrobes</u>
<u n="181" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah but you still have to pay for them initially</u>

<u n="188" who="S0255"><vocal desc="yawn"/> I'm sorry</u>
<u n="189" who="S0256">I just I don't know whether to send them back or what to do cos</u>

<u n="200" who="S0255">if you buy them and keep them think oh I'll have them when I get into them that could be six months before you get down actually just that er cos although you'll lose weight and tone up more the little bit where you need where you need the weight maybe on your stomach or on your hips</u>
<u n="201" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah I know I just annoying cos like I say erm I'm in between two <unclear/> sizes</u>

<u n="215" who="S0256">when I sit down er they're fine</u>
<u n="216" who="S0255">or the medium-rise ones</u>

<u n="218" who="S0255">oh yeah well you've so you've definitely lost weight so you should treat yourself to some new clothes</u>
<u n="219" who="S0256"><unclear/></u>
<u n="220" who="S0255">but the trouble is though you you look at the different sizes and you can get a ten a twelve or a fourteen and fit in all of them in different shops</u>
<u n="221" who="S0256">I know</u>
<u n="222" who="S0255">different sizes it's just ridiculous</u>
<u n="223" who="S0256">mm we know my problem with jeans they don't really design them for bums</u>

<u n="225" who="S0256">jeans are designed for no bums</u>
<u n="226" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="227" who="S0256">because they give you the material for no bums when you've got a bum you get a size that's big enough to fit your bum but falls down</u>
<u n="228" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="229" who="S0256">and then I can't I don't like wearing tight belts so</u>

<u n="239" who="S0256">mm you do just fit into them</u>
<u n="240" who="S0255">I do</u>
<u n="241" who="S0256">that's why I wear jeggings cos jeggings just stretch</u>
<u n="242" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="244" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="245" who="S0256">so I just live in jeggings but I'd rather not like in jeggings I'd rather get some jeans but cos they last longer jeggings don't last long</u>
