<u n="88" who="S0018">yeah but I know what you mean <pause dur="short"/> I think I mean cos I'm I've only got one salary coming in <vocal desc="laugh"/> although not at the moment <pause dur="short"/> um I was just thinking that it it's under twenty-five <pause dur="short"/> it's not a living wage</u>
<u n="89" who="S0170">it's not really</u>
<u n="90" who="S0018">you can't afford to to live pay rent let alone saving for a mortgage on anything below that</u>
<u n="91" who="S0170">yeah exactly <pause dur="short"/> and we have had I mean you've got more experience than me but we have had you know they're not it's not a job teaching English is not a job that you just go in into work and just do <pause dur="short"/> it's I think it and it gives you a lot of good er life experience as well with people <pause dur="short"/> how to deal with people <pause dur="short"/> how to manage situations <pause dur="short"/> cos you know I've had racism in the classroom</u>
<u n="92" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0170">I've had sexism <vocal desc="laugh"/> in the classroom <pause dur="short"/> especially with some of the people from from um usually from Iraq or Iran can be very racist</u>

<u n="101" who="S0170">guys from Africa</u>
<u n="102" who="S0018">how did he cope?</u>
<u n="103" who="S0170">he didn't say anything <pause dur="short"/> cos I said if you say anything else like that again you're not gonna be on this course</u>
<u n="104" who="S0018">did he get on with them?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0170">yeah he was fine after that <pause dur="short"/> he expected me to agree with him <pause dur="short"/> and when he saw my reaction was like of horror rather than <vocal desc="laugh"/> oh yeah you're right <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="106" who="S0018">I was surprised how racist the Chinese students were against Indian people</u>
<u n="107" who="S0170">oh yeah <unclear/></u>

<u n="109" who="S0170">yeah and I find if the Chinese girl were to have a a black boyfriend they would be you know ashamed the family be very</u>
<u n="110" who="S0018">what a shame <pause dur="short"/> yeah like no I think you're right <pause dur="short"/> I mean er the teaching <pause dur="short"/> it's a lot of different skills that you're pulling together all the time</u>
<u n="111" who="S0170">mhm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0018">and even like things like project management <pause dur="short"/> I mean there's no actual projects involved per se but you're still managing <pause dur="short"/> like every class is a project to be managed like</u>
<u n="113" who="S0170">definitely</u>
<u n="114" who="S0018">over the course of the  of the  the academic year or how long the course runs for</u>
<u n="115" who="S0170">mm <pause dur="short"/> you can communicate with people from all walks of life <pause dur="short"/> um and bring them together <pause dur="short"/> cos there can be conflicts in the classroom between certain individuals <pause dur="short"/> and you have to try and sort it out</u>
<u n="116" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0170">I had one class of they were all  they were all  Muslim men but they were from <trunc>var</trunc> different countries but with one Christian guy who was from Eritrea</u>
<u n="118" who="S0018">uh-huh <pause dur="short"/> oh I never knew how to pronounce that</u>
<u n="119" who="S0170">and um</u>
<u n="120" who="S0018">I've only ever seen it written down <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0170">well I think yeah Eritrea <pause dur="short"/> they er I think that's how you say it <pause dur="short"/> and um anyway this Eritrean guy was um saying that he wasn't gonna get married just yet <pause dur="short"/> and he was twenty-four twenty-five <pause dur="short"/> and the other  the other  guys were all no there was two Somali guys who were saying to him you must get married now  you must get married now  <pause dur="short"/> and um he's like well no I haven't got a job now and I don't want to get married until I can provide for my family <pause dur="short"/> and the one Somali guy was saying to him no you must get married it doesn't matter in this country <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> You don't need to have a job <pause dur="short"/> you don't need to worry about that <pause dur="short"/> um Allah will provide <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="122" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="123" who="S0170">and it really it just started into a big argument between everyone in the class because</u>
<u n="124" who="S0018">did it generate a lot of English though?</u>
<u n="125" who="S0170">it did yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0018">perfect <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="127" who="S0170">no it was great <pause dur="short"/> I mean that class they cos they were all from different countries <pause dur="short"/> there were two guys from the same country and they were both Somalian</u>
<u n="128" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0170">but the other guys was like Eritrean Iranian guy from Yemen um Iranian guy <pause dur="short"/> yeah there was all different countries and an Iraqi guy <pause dur="short"/> so <trunc>i</trunc> they had to speak English together <pause dur="short"/> I think some of them spoke Arabic <pause dur="short"/> they you know <trunc>w</trunc> not everyone</u>
<u n="130" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0170">so</u>
<u n="132" who="S0018">that was their only common language <pause dur="short"/> that's good</u>
<u n="133" who="S0170">but it <trunc>w</trunc> it <trunc>m</trunc> all men together was just such hard work <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="134" who="S0018">I can imagine <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="135" who="S0170">like cos the <trunc>sum</trunc> the summer school and I was like thinking after the first week oh my goodness <pause dur="short"/> maybe would have been better if they'd had a a male teacher <pause dur="short"/> But no they were alright about that <pause dur="short"/> except for one guy who was a bit disrespectful to me <pause dur="short"/> quite often actually</u>
<u n="136" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="137" who="S0170">the other guys were like <vocal desc="laugh"/> no don't do that <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="138" who="S0018">oh good <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah sometimes it's it's <trunc>e</trunc> less contentious to just let them sort it out themselves <pause dur="short"/> I had um a class of nineteen-year-olds <pause dur="short"/> one of which was er very very very heavily into the Opus Dei Church in Spain which</u>
<u n="139" who="S0170">oh right <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0018">are very religious Catholic order I think <pause dur="short"/> and her family she had about seven brothers and sisters cos they believe in having numerous er children cos that gives better better gifts to God or something I don't know</u>
<u n="141" who="S0170"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="142" who="S0018">and they were all going on a march in Madrid that weekend</u>
<u n="143" who="S0170">mhm</u>
<u n="144" who="S0018">against gay marriage <pause dur="short"/> because gay marriage was just about to be legalized in Spain</u>
<u n="145" who="S0170">mhm</u>
<u n="146" who="S0018">and there was a a girl in class who was a lesbian <pause dur="short"/> and quite openly so <pause dur="short"/> and she came to class with three of her friends from school <pause dur="short"/> so it was like to her it was</u>
<u n="147" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0018">you know a really open issue <pause dur="short"/> she was really you know very happy talking about it or what not <pause dur="short"/> but because she'd heard that um this other girl's family were going to the er the march she just um unsigned herself from the class <pause dur="short"/> she she stopped coming <pause dur="short"/> and the first day that she didn't come they had a huge argument about how</u>
<u n="149" who="S0170">the class did?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0018">like her three friends against this girl <pause dur="short"/> the Opus Dei girl <pause dur="short"/> and the worst thing about it was that she'd just been indoctrinated <pause dur="short"/> she'd just been brainwashed</u>
<u n="153" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="154" who="S0018">into having this opinion <pause dur="short"/> a really intelligent girl <pause dur="short"/> without having any logical <trunc>ar</trunc> logic whatsoever behind her arguments <pause dur="short"/> and these three girls just picked her apart totally <pause dur="short"/> and I I kind of felt I had to mediate in a way to make sure that she didn't feel that she was being picked on because there were more people that were completely against her opinion than shared it</u>
<u n="155" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0018">but I just took a bit of a backseat and just let them debate it because I I thought it was important for this Opus Dei girl to realize that her beliefs were unfounded</u>
<u n="157" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="158" who="S0018">and that you know kind of a jury of her peers was <trunc>l</trunc> leading her to realize</u>
<u n="159" who="S0170"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0018">that her beliefs were unfounded <pause dur="short"/> and that maybe she should apply a bit of logic and not</u>
<u n="161" who="S0170">mhm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0018">just blindly follow something that someone else is telling her to do</u>
<u n="163" who="S0170">it's it's so a shame like especially people who are from countries that um like in Somalia they're they are mainly Muslim but a lot of them have never read the Quran and they believe what they're told by their imams <pause dur="short"/> because the imam knows <trunc>th</trunc> well they believe that he's knows the Quran and he's read it <pause dur="short"/> so they just follow what he says without ever having read it <pause dur="short"/> without ever</u>
<u n="164" who="S0018">right so it's</u>
<u n="165" who="S0170">like a dog</u>
<u n="166" who="S0018">his interpretation</u>
<u n="167" who="S0170">is a dirty animal that you can't have a dog <pause dur="short"/> and some of the things they believe <pause dur="short"/> one student adamantly believed that if he wrote in the Quran and closed it when he opened on the same page it would be gone</u>
<u n="168" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="169" who="S0170">and he would be damned because it's you know it's the Quran and you should never do it anyway <pause dur="short"/> but I said but how okay why don't you try it and see? and he said well no no no no I could never do that because you know if if I do I'll die sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> And he really really</u>
<u n="170" who="S0018">didn't you offer to try yourself? <vocal desc="laugh"/> Well I can do it <pause dur="short"/> don't worry <unclear/></u>
<u n="171" who="S0170">I was tempted to but I thought no I'm gonna get in trouble if I took it too far <pause dur="short"/> but what some people have been led to believe is amazing <pause dur="short"/> cos they've just been told it their whole lives</u>
<u n="172" who="S0018">and how they don't then question it when they <trunc>ha</trunc> you know er develop rational thought processes</u>
<u n="173" who="S0170">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but you're teaching people to learn to read for the first time <pause dur="short"/> who've never <vocal desc="laugh"/> learnt in their own language</u>
<u n="174" who="S0018">I just wondered whether there might be too many brightness coming through for him</u>

<u n="404" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="405" who="S0018">I can't work out how to stop a call <pause dur="short"/> because when I'm speaking to someone on the phone</u>

<u n="415" who="S0018">the call</u>
<u n="416" who="S0170">the screen <pause dur="short"/> but it means the other person probably finished it already haven't they?</u>
<u n="417" who="S0018">I don't know but like</u>
<u n="418" who="S0170">yeah I think you just touch the screen</u>
<u n="419" who="S0018">when you phone someone and they've got answerphone on and you leave a message</u>
<u n="420" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="421" who="S0018">and they can't put the phone down <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="422" who="S0170">if you just touch the screen</u>
<u n="423" who="S0018">then</u>
<u n="424" who="S0170">and then it should come up like</u>
<u n="425" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="426" who="S0170">and</u>
<u n="427" who="S0018">aha <pause dur="short"/> it's obviously too smart for me</u>
<u n="428" who="S0170">two minutes and he's gone</u>
<u n="429" who="S0018">aw</u>
<u n="430" who="S0170">I knew he would but <vocal desc="laugh"/> I was really desperate <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="431" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="432" who="S0170">determined not desperate <pause dur="short"/> determined that no I'm not going to do it but it's just so easy</u>
<u n="433" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="434" who="S0170">to do it like that <pause dur="short"/> but sometimes it's just makes life easier</u>
<u n="435" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I can imagine <pause dur="short"/> oh well it makes for a less stressed happy mummy</u>
<u n="436" who="S0170">mm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="437" who="S0018">that's probably important</u>
<u n="438" who="S0170">mm yeah</u>
<u n="439" who="S0018">is there something in breast milk that's like a</u>
<u n="440" who="S0170">apparently when you breastfeed you release hormones that er make it easier for you to fall back to fall asleep</u>
<u n="441" who="S0018">oh right</u>
<u n="442" who="S0170">I don't know if that's passed on to him</u>
<u n="443" who="S0018">aha</u>
<u n="444" who="S0170">but for him it um breastfeeding is just very relaxing for him and makes him feel safe</u>
<u n="445" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="446" who="S0170">so he feels safe to be able to fall asleep</u>
<u n="447" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="448" who="S0170">and um it lowers the heartbeat <pause dur="short"/> it um and when they're stressed destresses him</u>
<u n="449" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="450" who="S0170">so it's a wonderful thing</u>
<u n="451" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="452" who="S0170">but I think bottle er does the same <pause dur="short"/> if they're used to bottle feeding that makes them feel because they're with you and next to you and you're holding them and feeding them</u>
<u n="453" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="454" who="S0170">they get the same feeling</u>
<u n="455" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="456" who="S0170">but then they can use a dummy <pause dur="short"/> cos if they usually only take a bottle they'll usually take a dummy</u>
<u n="457" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="458" who="S0170">so</u>
<u n="459" who="S0018">and he's out like a light</u>

<u n="463" who="S0018">really? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="464" who="S0170">actually I need to weigh him to find out <pause dur="short"/> er you can book to go to baby clinic and you book when you've when you feel like it <pause dur="short"/> if you want to know if he's growing okay <pause dur="short"/> you can book like every week but they probably wouldn't <vocal desc="laugh"/> wouldn't be too happy if you went every week <pause dur="short"/> but you can book when you want</u>
<u n="465" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="466" who="S0170">so if you're worried <pause dur="short"/> like maybe I'm not making enough breast milk and I think he's not put on weight</u>
<u n="467" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="468" who="S0170">so you can just go they'll check and make they <trunc>ch</trunc> chart the growth</u>

<u n="470" who="S0170">and he'll on the larger side <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="477" who="S0018">mhm</u>
