<u n="206" who="S0107">something different</u>
<pause dur="long"/>

<u n="212" who="S0110">do you actually make pigeons?</u>
<u n="213" who="S0108">I will make one pigeon for eh for the advert and then basically they just turn up and do whatever they like <pause dur="short"/> I think mainly the crafts are very tenuously linked into the theme <pause dur="short"/> eh but when they turn up the kids just do whatever they want <pause dur="short"/> so we'll do the shirt painting which will be make your own sports kit or whatever <pause dur="short"/> eh and then they'll just come and get their friends to sign their t shirts and that will be their attempt at making their own kit <pause dur="short"/> and the boys will all sit and make friendship bracelets</u>
<u n="214" who="S0110">Don't they  Don't they  want to make designs and? Do you have fabric pens and things?</u>
<u n="215" who="S0108">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> you have they have all the equipment that you could want <pause dur="short"/> it's just kids these days they lack creativity <pause dur="short"/> if I do something they will copy it <pause dur="short"/> like last year I made a photo frame with blue and white triangles on the borders and everybody came out with photo frames with blue and white triangles on the border</u>
