<u n="40" who="S0558">and er yeah within that twelve months otherwise they've got to start again I mean if you if you were buying it for the plot and the location and all the rest of it to be honest I don't think the fact that plans were about to expire would</u>
<u n="41" who="S0517" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="42" who="S0558">overly concern me because it's highly unlikely they're gonna say no next time round when permission has been given</u>
