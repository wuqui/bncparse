<u n="54" who="S0284">mm <pause dur="long"/> well <pause dur="short"/> yes well I got one <pause dur="short"/> not far back <pause dur="short"/> and we don't know <trunc>wh</trunc>what happened <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah my cousin's still looking into it</u>
<u n="55" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0284" trans="overlap">and <pause dur="short"/> oh I thought that was a bit <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="57" who="S0282">oh no there's only one <pause dur="short"/> no there's two no there's one <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="58" who="S0284">and <pause dur="short"/> no my cousin's still <trunc>res</trunc> still researching it but <pause dur="short"/> things don't things don't match up with <trunc>the</trunc> with those census records and <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>th</trunc>there's a family story that erm <pause dur="short"/> someone around that time was was married <pause dur="short"/> was married twice</u>
<u n="59" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="60" who="S0284">er <pause dur="short"/> probably not bigamously <pause dur="short"/> but erm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0282">oh right</u>
<u n="62" who="S0284">so we don't know we don't know what happened that time</u>
<u n="63" who="S0282" trans="overlap">alright</u>
<u n="64" who="S0284">so</u>
<u n="65" who="S0282">oh</u>
<u n="66" who="S0284">well <trunc>tha</trunc>that's not terribly far back</u>
<u n="67" who="S0282">well I had a similar thing my great grandmother ran off <pause dur="short"/> with somebody <pause dur="short"/> during the First World War left five children <pause dur="short"/> erm who then had to go and live with their aunt</u>
<u n="68" who="S0284">mm</u>
<u n="69" who="S0282" trans="overlap">and run off with somebody who was ten years her junior</u>
<u n="70" who="S0284">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0282">and er they er then had another family and she had another four children <pause dur="short"/> so what with the one that died in infancy that was ten children <pause dur="short"/> that she had anyway she er <pause dur="short"/> my great grandmother divorced her <pause dur="short"/> and so she eventually married this other guy <pause dur="short"/> erm and</u>
<u n="72" who="S0284" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0282">well she <trunc>s</trunc> lived with him the whole rest of her life and I think was very happy but erm my father er my grandmother would pretend that <trunc>sh</trunc>she died <vocal desc="laugh"/> and my father was always told that she was dead <pause dur="short"/> when in fact she wasn't she was only living about er thirty-five or forty miles away in erm in Nottingham</u>
<u n="74" who="S0284">oh wow wow <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0282">and only died <pause dur="short"/> in the nineteen sixties so it would've been perfectly feasible to</u>
<u n="76" who="S0284">mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0282">to er have met or known her actually</u>
<u n="78" who="S0284">mm mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0282">but erm <pause dur="short"/> but anyway she was erm <pause dur="short"/> her family except they don't want to know our family</u>
<u n="80" who="S0284">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0282">because erm <pause dur="short"/> there's still somebody living from my grandmother's generation who would probably kill him of shock if he found out</u>
<u n="82" who="S0284">right <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="long"/> and that's intriguing cos she didn't have any <pause dur="short"/> the options weren't so weren't so wide as they were now as they are were they?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0282" trans="overlap">well no cos <trunc>i</trunc> cos it's of <unclear>digit transition</unclear> cos if the <pause dur="short"/> before erm we didn't know what happened we couldn't know if she had got married to this guy or if they'd lived together erm bigamously or <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> or whether erm she had <trunc>d</trunc> she never got married to him or what had happened and erm <pause dur="short"/> and it would've meant that I would've needed to work out when they were likely to have been divorced</u>
<u n="84" who="S0284">yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0282" trans="overlap">from her first husband <pause dur="short"/> and then worked out where it took place and I would've had to then to do sort of do quite a lot of research you know digging about manually as it were and given that she had quite a <trunc>co</trunc> not a <pause dur="short"/> a totally common <pause dur="short"/> surname but a relatively common surname she only had one first name and one surname so therefore</u>
<u n="86" who="S0284" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0282">even in the year where she was born there's forty or fifty women born in that same year with that exactly the same name</u>
<u n="88" who="S0284">yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0282">and erm we didn't know the name of the man she'd run off with so erm so it all sounded a bit impossible until such time as erm one day she just popped up on a <pause dur="short"/> ancestry dot co dot UK search</u>
<u n="90" who="S0284">wow wow gosh yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm so and then which was divorce record</u>
<u n="92" who="S0284">right</u>
<u n="93" who="S0282">so somebody some labour in somewhere some <unclear/> in America I think probably</u>
<u n="94" who="S0284">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="95" who="S0282" trans="overlap"><unclear/> the records and there's you know made a note on it on the <pause dur="short"/> digital files and up it pops so something has lost forever just suddenly rose the top of the <pause dur="short"/> file</u>
<u n="96" who="S0284">yeah <pause dur="short"/> wow yes well you're erm <pause dur="short"/> you're very fortunate like that aren't you? cos some</u>
<u n="97" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0284">no one knows anything about my mother's family <pause dur="short"/> or or that's that's <trunc>th</trunc> that's the story</u>
<u n="99" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0284">and I was trying to track down some friends who live <pause dur="short"/> from their Facebook entry looks as if they might've <pause dur="short"/> their friends from college they might be living erm just three or four miles away from me</u>
<u n="101" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0284">same place scenarios as <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> actually</u>
<u n="103" who="S0282">oh right</u>
<u n="104" who="S0284">and <pause dur="short"/> so what did I have to do? I had to <pause dur="short"/> in really trying to track down them I <pause dur="short"/> I had to pay five pounds to Gingery United <pause dur="short"/> and I only used <pause dur="short"/> sort of fifty pence</u>
<u n="105" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0284">in trying to track down the the other people</u>
<u n="107" who="S0282">oh right <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="108" who="S0284">er and <pause dur="short"/> so often one that'd gone by they reminded me I only got another three days to use my remaining four pounds fifty <pause dur="short"/> and I <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> probably been talking to my cousin on my mother's side and she <pause dur="short"/> talked a little bit er and her <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>s</trunc> cos she just one of the reasons I moved here was cos her cousin is only down in Fareham</u>
<u n="109" who="S0282">alright okay</u>
<u n="110" who="S0284" trans="overlap">so she's only half an hour's drive away</u>
<u n="111" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0284">and she <pause dur="short"/> er er had sent me a <trunc>l</trunc> copy of the marriage certificates <pause dur="short"/> of my grandfather <pause dur="short"/> and we knew about <pause dur="short"/> my mother's father's side but not my mother's mother's side <pause dur="short"/> so I just <pause dur="short"/> put in put in her name and and the records came up <pause dur="short"/> very quickly with her father's name and I tracked down</u>
<u n="113" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0284">her father's name and <pause dur="short"/> you know within <pause dur="short"/> three or four searches then adds <pause dur="short"/> then adds erm <pause dur="long"/> yes yes that's it because there was a reasonable amount of information for</u>
<u n="115" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0284">mother's mother</u>
<u n="117" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="118" who="S0284">and erm mother's grandfather <pause dur="short"/> which actually explains <pause dur="short"/> explains a lot</u>
<u n="119" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="120" who="S0284">because <pause dur="short"/> not that they always <pause dur="short"/> pretended that erm she was <unclear/> as she was</u>
<u n="121" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="122" who="S0284">it seemed to me</u>
<u n="123" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="124" who="S0284">I mean I didn't know but as soon as she <trunc>s</trunc> she she <trunc>ref</trunc> I mean she was fairly militant as a as a as a woman and as as as as a feminist</u>
<u n="125" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="126" who="S0284">erm <pause dur="short"/> er and that was great so I was brought up <pause dur="short"/> taking it for granted that if you work full-time as a warden you didn't do housework</u>
<u n="127" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="128" who="S0284">er <pause dur="short"/> er and and things like that so I I just took it for granted that that erm <pause dur="short"/> er that reasonably educated women did <pause dur="short"/> if they wanted they did did have a did have a job</u>
<u n="129" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0284" trans="overlap">as as my mother always has</u>

<u n="146" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0284">erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>an</trunc>and part of the resentment she says was she was never brought up to do this</u>
