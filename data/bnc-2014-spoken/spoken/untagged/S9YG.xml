<u n="1" who="S0618">there we are hello</u>
<u n="2" who="S0619" trans="overlap">I was sat hello hello</u>
<u n="3" who="S0618">there we are</u>
<u n="4" who="S0619">erm no I was sat on the balcony on Tuesday for hours reading and <pause dur="short"/> drinking tea</u>
<u n="5" who="S0618">very good</u>
<u n="6" who="S0619">I just needed the sun</u>
<u n="7" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0619">and it was so nice and I thought I can't believe it feels like spring</u>
<u n="9" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="10" who="S0619">and then today it's like no <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="11" who="S0618">I know</u>
<u n="12" who="S0619" trans="overlap">and I checked the weather again and it's like up and down up and down and then snow scheduled next Friday as well</u>
<u n="13" who="S0618">yeah but it's funny though cos it'll say snow and then the day will roll round and it'll be rain</u>
<u n="14" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="15" who="S0618">but last night's snow was forecast but I just couldn't believe it when it actually appeared</u>
<u n="16" who="S0619" trans="overlap">no I know</u>
<u n="17" who="S0618">it's just so weird going from fourteen degrees to I think there was probably three or four inches last night</u>
<u n="18" who="S0619">yeah and it's not it wasn't even that cold I don't think I didn't think it was below zero</u>
<u n="19" who="S0618" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> no I agree and this morning the melt was on erm two degrees today apparently so mm yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah mm random I'm just <pause dur="short"/> really I just need some sun now</u>
<u n="21" who="S0618">yeah sun and rest I should think</u>
<u n="22" who="S0619" trans="overlap">just for <pause dur="short"/> mm mm</u>
<u n="23" who="S0618">mm so</u>
<u n="24" who="S0619" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="25" who="S0618">when are you off at you've got today off are you taking?</u>
<u n="26" who="S0619">no I'm in for three hours from four to seven just doing mock speaking exams</u>
<u n="27" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> have you got speak for that?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0619" trans="overlap">cancelled my one to one's yeah it's just like asking questions</u>
<u n="29" who="S0618">okay</u>
<u n="30" who="S0619">it's really not a lot erm <pause dur="short"/> cos I just feel so no I know like <pause dur="short"/> erm in no way should I feel guilty</u>
<u n="31" who="S0618">no god no you're sick</u>
<u n="32" who="S0619" trans="overlap">but <pause dur="short"/> you kind of do anyway</u>
<u n="33" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="34" who="S0619">and I was thinking about it I was like I've never taken time off work apart from once when I was nineteen and I fell down some stairs in a nightclub and broke my nose</u>
<u n="35" who="S0618"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="36" who="S0619">cos I'd drank like a bottle of gin straight</u>
<u n="37" who="S0618">oh that'll do it <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="38" who="S0619">er and then had to my I couldn't even speak my friend had to phone it was when I worked at a clothes shop at uni my friend had to go she just can't come in today cos she's just broken her nose and she's got two black eyes and her face is full of cuts</u>
<u n="39" who="S0618"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="40" who="S0619">so she'll be off for about a week</u>
<u n="41" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="42" who="S0619">and I thought I've never taken time off apart from that er and you know I just feel a bit of a wuss like it's er it's only a cold</u>
<u n="43" who="S0618">I'd say it speaks more of a lack of self-love</u>
<u n="44" who="S0619">do you think?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0618">not wishing to pass on any judgement <trunc>bu</trunc></u>
<u n="46" who="S0619">no go on</u>
<u n="47" who="S0618" trans="overlap">but yeah cos I feel if you love yourself and respect yourself sufficiently then you really want to take good care of the physical human organism your consciousness occupies for a short period of time</u>
<u n="48" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> mm mm mm mm mm mm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0618">and you take care of it and you nurture it and if it's not functioning right you give it what it needs until it does which is usually rest</u>
<u n="50" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> true I'm not a very resty person</u>
<u n="51" who="S0618" trans="overlap">and I think that's why the <pause dur="short"/> no I know</u>
<u n="52" who="S0619">I think that's the problem</u>
<u n="53" who="S0618">or even just <pause dur="short"/> rest sounds like being horizontal and not doing anything</u>
<u n="54" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0618">but it could be just watching Netflix sending emails</u>
<u n="56" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0618">fiddling about on Facebook whatever sitting on the balcony reading a book when it's not full of snow</u>
<u n="58" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm mm mm mm</u>
<u n="59" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0619">yeah I know but I think it's just tricky I find it really hard</u>
<u n="61" who="S0618" trans="overlap">so <pause dur="short"/> I suppose we come from a culture where there's a lot of guilt associated with time off</u>
<u n="62" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0618">and there's this perception that you need to martyr yourself to every role and</u>
<u n="64" who="S0619">and here I think it's completely different</u>
<u n="65" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0619">if you're sick you don't go to work and in England I you know I was sort of talking about this on Twitter the other day like if you're in an office <pause dur="short"/> people <pause dur="short"/> you know say stuff if you you're off work because you've got a cold or whatever</u>
<u n="67" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0619">but then if you're in work and you've got a cold people are like oh god this person's sniffing the whole time</u>
<u n="69" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0619">so you can't win</u>
<u n="71" who="S0618" trans="overlap">you can't win so you might as well do what gives you your greatest joy</u>
<u n="72" who="S0619" trans="overlap">whatever you want yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0619">but I I <trunc>ju</trunc> I feel guilty in the sense that other people are going to have to cover my lessons or they're all being cancelled and all of this stuff so it's just a bit shit</u>
<u n="75" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah I suppose I can understand that if other people need to do more</u>
<u n="76" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0618">but then people get sick so the organisation really expects that that's gonna happen</u>
<u n="78" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah and I've covered lessons for loads of people so</u>
<u n="79" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0619">er</u>
<u n="81" who="S0618">and I imagine there are a lot of people who want the extra money</u>
<u n="82" who="S0619">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0619">so</u>
<u n="85" who="S0618">so you might even be doing somebody a favour</u>
<u n="86" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="87" who="S0618">let's face it the Christmas card credit card bills have just come in</u>
<u n="88" who="S0619">true</u>
<u n="89" who="S0618">there are probably Polish people going fuck how am I going to pay this?</u>
<u n="90" who="S0619">yeah and it was winter break and they had were underpaid so</u>
<u n="91" who="S0618" trans="overlap">and then ta da <pause dur="short"/> yeah so now some extra hours</u>
<u n="92" who="S0619">yeah true</u>
<u n="93" who="S0618">they'd probably be full of gratitude hooray <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s sick hooray</u>
<u n="94" who="S0619" trans="overlap">hooray oh thank you thank you</u>
<u n="95" who="S0618">I think it all works out though</u>
<u n="96" who="S0619">no I think it'll be fine and by Monday hopefully I'll be right as rain I'm just really pissed off because I was doing everything right I was like</u>
<u n="97" who="S0618">describe right</u>
<u n="98" who="S0619">well I was eating right drinking right going to the gym being like sort of really positive</u>
<u n="99" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0619">and like we talked about this loads I was like in a really good frame of mind and I'm just so annoyed that I feel like I've been set back</u>
<u n="101" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0619">you know and it'll take some time to get back to that point</u>
<u n="103" who="S0618">but I I think I said to you in a Whatsapp message I I do wonder is this like the final purge of all of that shit that you've been through in December</u>
<u n="104" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0618">and this just might be everything just coming out now</u>
<u n="106" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0618">cos it's gotta have it's release at some point so if you've been doing all of the stuff that helps your body</u>
<u n="108" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="109" who="S0618">and helps your mind and helps you know every aspect of you then it's it's just I don't know I do see it as that purging process it's that getting it all out</u>
<u n="110" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm mm mm mm yeah part of the recovery</u>
<u n="111" who="S0618">and with lungs you know you'll be coughing it all up that's quite literal really of getting out that which is within and no longer serves you</u>

<u n="307" who="S0619">ah ha ha</u>
<u n="308" who="S0618">but yeah</u>
<u n="309" who="S0619">mm it's funny what you say about you know going back and feeling sort of loved and appreciated <pause dur="short"/> and I think whenever I go home you know apart from sort of my immediate family it doesn't feel like that because</u>
<u n="310" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="311" who="S0619">and I think it's because we're all in our <pause dur="short"/> like early mid twenties and everyone's coming going leaving</u>
<u n="312" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="313" who="S0619">away and come back</u>

<u n="316" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="317" who="S0619">and any particular feeling of return because everyone's always</u>
<u n="318" who="S0618">yeah everyone's doing it there's not a core of people who are always there</u>
<u n="319" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="320" who="S0618">in the same houses in the same jobs</u>
<u n="321" who="S0619" trans="overlap">so you really sort of <pause dur="short"/> yeah so at Christmas when you see absolutely everybody it's really really nice but it's not sort of individual to you everyone feels the same way about everybody I suppose</u>
<u n="322" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="323" who="S0619">er which is you know it's not a bad thing but sort of I'm sort saying it in a sort of selfish way but it's just a sort of different situation I suppose</u>
<u n="324" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's interesting I wonder if that's a stage of life thing because those folks are all aged <trunc>pr</trunc> forty to seventy-five</u>
<u n="325" who="S0619">yeah so they're settled</u>
<u n="326" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0619">they're in the same place and when someone leaves that community it's much more obvious</u>
<u n="328" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="329" who="S0619">erm</u>
<u n="330" who="S0618" trans="overlap">whereas with your age group</u>
<u n="331" who="S0619" trans="overlap">what I mean there's sort of</u>
<u n="332" who="S0618">there's the leaving for uni thing and then there's leaving for various jobs thing</u>
<u n="333" who="S0619">yeah and there's no <pause dur="short"/> nobody's really settled yet</u>
<u n="334" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0619">I suppose</u>
<u n="336" who="S0618">yeah and I guess over the next decade for you and your friends there's gonna be the getting married and having babies thing</u>
<u n="337" who="S0619">yeah so I anticipate really in the next ten years a lot of people will come back home</u>
<u n="338" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="339" who="S0619">they've been to London or they've been abroad or whatever <pause dur="short"/> but when they find somebody they'll probably go back home I guess</u>
<u n="340" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> interesting</u>
<u n="341" who="S0619">I think so</u>
<u n="342" who="S0618">do you equate a relationship with putting down roots in a particular geographical location?</u>
<u n="343" who="S0619">I don't associate relationship with anything to do with me so</u>
<u n="344" who="S0618"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="345" who="S0619">so <pause dur="short"/> so can I</u>
<u n="346" who="S0618" trans="overlap">completely independent no idea</u>
<u n="347" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="348" who="S0619">so I don't know er <pause dur="short"/> but in general do I associate relationships with putting roots down in a particular place? yeah I think so</u>
<u n="349" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0619">but maybe that's just because that's what <pause dur="short"/> society seems to suggest <pause dur="short"/> you should do</u>
<u n="351" who="S0618">mm <pause dur="short"/> I guess yeah I guess historically and traditionally you get married you buy a house you breed <vocal desc="laugh"/> and then <pause dur="short"/> once you've been breeding your offspring need schools</u>
<u n="352" who="S0619">yes</u>
<u n="353" who="S0618">and that I guess is where moving about can cause disruption</u>
<u n="354" who="S0619">mm mm yeah especially for kids in schools yeah for sure</u>
<u n="355" who="S0618" trans="overlap">the small people <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
