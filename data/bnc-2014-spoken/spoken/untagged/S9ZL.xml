<u n="59" who="S0687">begin in Pazin which can be reached on the fast road connecting Rijeka with Rovinj and Pula this small industrial town with a population of around ten thousand may not have immediate appeal but it is worth a flying visit the highlight is the castle first mentioned in nine nine hundred and eighty-three AD as a gift from emperor Otto the second of Hungary to the bishop of Porec the castle now and ethnographic museum</u>
<u n="60" who="S0689">was that was that what actually really happened or is that just mythology?</u>

<u n="75" who="S0687"><trunc>al</trunc>although he never visited Pazin the French novelist Jules Verne was inspired by the pit and the little river that disappears underground the hero of his novel Mathias Sandorf was imprisoned in the castle and escaped by swimming along the underground river to the sea <pause dur="short"/> leave Pazin by taking the main road through the middle of town in the direction of Rijeka and the Ucka Tunnel after two kilometres blah-di-blah-di-blah-di-blah it's just giving you directions <pause dur="short"/> the little village of Draguc little more than a single road of houses and a tall church perched on a cliff in the seventies and eighties this was known as the Istrian Hollywood as a number of films were shot here but these days the village is largely deserted</u>
