<u n="77" who="S0281">mm</u>

<u n="82" who="S0015" trans="overlap">what we eat and what we do our lives</u>
<u n="83" who="S0281">yep everything's changing well it's like most places in the world everybody's becoming more American you know?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0015">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0281">it's er cultural colonisation</u>
<u n="86" who="S0015">oh I <unclear>suppose</unclear> so</u>

<u n="96" who="S0015" trans="overlap">films and things yeah mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0281">and that's why I I you know as a teacher I have noticed in the way that language changes and the way people speak and most of it <vocal desc="laugh"/> really annoys me <unclear>it well</unclear></u>
