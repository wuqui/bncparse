<u n="3" who="S0525">I don't know I think if it was personal property <trunc>y</trunc>you had to you were yeah I think it had to be tied into the business somehow if it was through a through a business pension yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think so I'm not sure they change the rules all the time and I've been out of it a long time now</u>
<u n="4" who="S0641">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so are you gonna start contributing <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>

<u n="10" who="S0525">you should find out if it's linked to <pause dur="short"/> them putting you in a percentage of what you put in</u>
<u n="11" who="S0641">there might be a good scheme and they might obviously not match it but they might</u>
<u n="12" who="S0525">mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0641">contribute quite a little</u>
<u n="14" who="S0525">mm</u>
<u n="15" who="S0641">or at least an amount</u>
<u n="16" who="S0525">they might do yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> but then for I forget the reason why we decided not to buy our property cos erm oh because erm well properties were going down weren't they? and they weren't selling so we thought we'd carry on renting our</u>
<u n="17" who="S0617">mm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0525">our business property but of course if you then <pause dur="short"/> if you've got a pension pot so if you and you know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and you the business or whatever you if you've built up a pension pot and you decide to buy a property <pause dur="short"/> the property then has to pay rent <pause dur="short"/> to the pension pot so the pension pot</u>
<u n="19" who="S0641" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="20" who="S0525">so the pension pot is making money <pause dur="short"/> because you're charging rental and and you're setting that rental</u>

<u n="1835" who="S0641">mm</u>
<u n="1836" who="S0525">but I'm thinking if she doesn't plead guilty that's when they might be calling upon <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and whoever else gave statements to go to court</u>
<u n="1837" who="S0622">yes</u>
<u n="1838" who="S0525">would you expect that?</u>

<u n="1850" who="S0617" trans="overlap">cos she's done it on</u>
<u n="1851" who="S0525" trans="overlap">it depends if she's got</u>
<u n="1852" who="S0617">countless times</u>
<u n="1853" who="S0525">how how did they know she's done it</u>
<u n="1854" who="S0622" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">yeah she's probably well-known <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1855" who="S0525" trans="overlap">how did they know that? did they know who she was then?</u>
<u n="1856" who="S0617">well cos she did it in the high street store the other <anon type="place"/> and then <trunc>af</trunc></u>
<u n="1857" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah but that was on the same day</u>
<u n="1858" who="S0641" trans="overlap">that was still within the same day</u>
<u n="1859" who="S0525">so</u>
<u n="1860" who="S0617">no it wasn't the same day</u>
<u n="1861" who="S0641">oh was it not?</u>
<u n="1862" who="S0525">oh she's</u>
<u n="1863" who="S0617" trans="overlap">no she was doing it on various occasions</u>
<u n="1864" who="S0622">oh really? oh right</u>
<u n="1865" who="S0641" trans="overlap">oh so they do know her?</u>
<u n="1866" who="S0617">yeah</u>
<u n="1867" who="S0525" trans="overlap">they have caught her before then they've obviously convicted her <trunc>bef</trunc></u>
<u n="1868" who="S0617" trans="overlap">no no no no no they haven't caught her before but they know that she's</u>
<u n="1869" who="S0641" trans="overlap">how do they know who she is then? <pause dur="short"/> if she's never been caught</u>
<u n="1870" who="S0617" trans="overlap">because they've got CCTV on the other stores <pause dur="short"/> so she's done it from the high street like a week before us and then came in and did it with us</u>
<u n="1871" who="S0525" trans="overlap">well a week before so we're talking about has she got a history from</u>
<u n="1872" who="S0617">oh right</u>
<u n="1873" who="S0525" trans="overlap">the year before six months before she'd been convicted before now</u>
<u n="1874" who="S0617" trans="overlap">oh I don't know</u>
<u n="1875" who="S0525">that's what we're saying that's what gives you a record</u>
<u n="1876" who="S0617">oh I don't know</u>
<u n="1877" who="S0525">so if she's been if she hasn't been convicted before</u>
<u n="1878" who="S0617">yeah</u>
<u n="1879" who="S0525">this this is her first offence they've actually charged her with then</u>
<u n="1880" who="S0617" trans="overlap">he told me she's done it on numerous occasions so if she gets caught now then she's going to prison</u>
<u n="1881" who="S0622" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="1882" who="S0641">so how does so they do know who she is then?</u>
<u n="1883" who="S0617">I guess so then if he said that to me yeah that's what the policeman said to me</u>
<u n="1884" who="S0641">oh</u>
<u n="1885" who="S0622" trans="overlap">well she's probably</u>
<u n="1886" who="S0525" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="1887" who="S0622">been cautioned or something before and they</u>
<u n="1888" who="S0525">yeah</u>
<u n="1889" who="S0641">yeah</u>
<u n="1890" who="S0525">yeah they must have recognised her from the CCTV</u>
<u n="1891" who="S0641" trans="overlap">they must her on file</u>
<u n="1892" who="S0622">so she's on bail and therefore if she does it</u>
<u n="1893" who="S0641">mm</u>
<u n="1894" who="S0622">she's gonna</u>
<u n="1895" who="S0525">right <pause dur="short"/> so I suppose it it depends now whether she pleads guilty or not</u>
<u n="1896" who="S0617">yeah</u>
<u n="1897" who="S0622" trans="overlap">it'll be difficult for not not to really isn't it? because she</u>
<u n="1898" who="S0617">we've got pictures of her</u>
<u n="1899" who="S0622" trans="overlap">there's pictures of her and <pause dur="short"/> descriptions and all sorts so</u>
<u n="1900" who="S0525">that's what I thought yeah <pause dur="short"/> they've got quite a lot of evidence that you'd be stupid not to plead guilty because if she pleads not guilty and gets found guilty the sentence'll be</u>
<u n="1901" who="S0622">greater</u>
<u n="1902" who="S0525">harsher <pause dur="short"/> so I'm thinking if they've got all the information stacked and she's got an actual <trunc>senten</trunc> and she'll just plead guilty and try and get off with a a lighter sentence</u>
<u n="1903" who="S0622">mm</u>
<u n="1904" who="S0617">and then she'll come out and try and find me</u>
<u n="1905" who="S0525">well no not if she not if you don't have to testify</u>
<u n="1906" who="S0617" trans="overlap">she will</u>
<u n="1907" who="S0525">not if you haven't gotta testify</u>
<u n="1908" who="S0622"><unclear/> but it's not just you</u>
<u n="1909" who="S0617" trans="overlap">yeah but if if I go to prison if if I go to erm</u>
<u n="1910" who="S0641"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1911" who="S0617">court whatever and have to sit there and watch her she then knows again what I look like</u>
<u n="1912" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1913" who="S0617">and she'll she they they probably do come and find you then don't they?</u>
<u n="1914" who="S0525" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="1915" who="S0641">and do what?</u>
<u n="1916" who="S0617">or like you say that she's got friends of friends in the audience</u>
<u n="1917" who="S0525">we've watched a bit too much erm</u>
<u n="1918" who="S0617">that'll come and find me</u>

<u n="1922" who="S0617">she'll have friends of friends in the audience</u>

<u n="1926" who="S0641"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1927" who="S0525">like you you said they I said I said that's always a risk I said cos we've watched a lot of crime programmes but this is petty theft and she might not bother and she might not have friends</u>
<u n="1928" who="S0617">but if she does bother and comes back</u>
<u n="1929" who="S0525" trans="overlap">or <pause dur="short"/> but the <trunc>al</trunc> the thing I also said</u>
<u n="1930" who="S0617" trans="overlap">follows me to the train station</u>
<u n="1931" who="S0525" trans="overlap">the thing I also said to you is you don't have to go to court they can't make you go to court you can say I'm not going and you can say to the police look it you know you you can say is this conviction dependent on me coming to court? have you got enough evidence without me? because I really don't want to do it you know you you can</u>

<u n="1934" who="S0617">no</u>
<u n="1935" who="S0525">so let's see what happens</u>
<u n="1936" who="S0641">I guess the difference is they'll do her for <pause dur="short"/> theft regardless I guess it's for the assault that they would need</u>
<u n="1937" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1938" who="S0641"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> to</u>

<u n="1940" who="S0641">they'll probably need a statement from you then or maybe an appearance</u>
<u n="1941" who="S0622">so if you wanted to press charges now they've got her you could do</u>
<u n="1942" who="S0525">compensation</u>
