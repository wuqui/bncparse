<u n="686" who="S0302">mm and they've been asking for some time</u>
<u n="687" who="S0262">mm <pause dur="short"/> and dad just simply wrote back to him thinking oh I'll just tell him that you know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s passed on and erm and then but I don't think I'll probably hear anything again from him</u>
<u n="688" who="S0302">yeah</u>

<u n="690" who="S0302">mm mm mm mm</u>
<u n="691" who="S0262">and then he went on to say what he'd been doing for the last <pause dur="short"/> fifty years which has been basically he's a scientist he's a sort of genetic researcher of some kind <pause dur="short"/> he's been doing this for years in this Welsh family that happens to be my mum's dad who's called <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="692" who="S0302">oh</u>
<u n="693" who="S0262" trans="overlap">is is the family that he's been fascinated by and he's been doing all this research into it</u>
<u n="694" who="S0302">so wait a minute so can I go back up one thing so this is your mum's dad</u>
<u n="695" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="696" who="S0302">who had your mum is your mum born first or after they were</u>
<u n="697" who="S0262" trans="overlap">my mum was born first</u>
<u n="698" who="S0302">mm yeah</u>
<u n="699" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and so mum er my gran</u>
<u n="700" who="S0302" trans="overlap">then the second marriage is the other</u>
<u n="701" who="S0262"><trunc>ye</trunc> well actually that's the thing at the time that was what happened was probably why they never met was because though my <trunc>fa</trunc> my grandfather <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> married my mother er grandmother <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> well <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that was her name</u>
<u n="702" who="S0302">yeah</u>
<u n="703" who="S0262">became <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> through marriage and then they got divorced when my mum was quite about er erm young maybe five-ish around that mark</u>
<u n="704" who="S0302">oh right so does oh you don't know did your mum remember him? you don't know?</u>
<u n="705" who="S0262" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="706" who="S0302">oh yeah yeah your dad</u>
<u n="707" who="S0262" trans="overlap">oh my yeah</u>
<u n="708" who="S0302" trans="overlap">oh yeah right</u>
<u n="709" who="S0262">that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> she really hated him</u>
<u n="710" who="S0302">oh I see she remembered him in that way</u>
<u n="711" who="S0262">because erm as far as she was concerned she he turned his back on her as a child <pause dur="short"/> and she never received any she never got she never got the impression that well she <trunc>cer</trunc> put it this way she never felt loved by him she certainly felt very rejected by him but this is where <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> comes in which is my mum's half-sister that's my mum's half-sister who I met</u>
<u n="712" who="S0302" trans="overlap">now how much younger is she?</u>
<u n="713" who="S0262">she's what sorry?</u>
<u n="714" who="S0302">how much younger is she than your mum would have been?</u>
<u n="715" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well this is what I'm trying to figure out because</u>
<u n="716" who="S0302">because then you can figure out when they got together and when their</u>
<u n="717" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="718" who="S0302">their children</u>
<u n="719" who="S0262">well I think it's true that <pause dur="short"/> we discussed it I mean she's very open about it all we discussed it quite openly and she said you know I was born illegitimate and so was my brother <pause dur="short"/> so your mother would have had me as a half-sister and a half-brother <pause dur="short"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was my father too so your mother and my and me we we share the the father</u>
<u n="720" who="S0302">yeah</u>
<u n="721" who="S0262">and it's probably quite fair to say that in those days divorce isn't something you just do with the flick of your wrist</u>
<u n="722" who="S0302" trans="overlap">no well</u>
<u n="723" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you actually had to have a reason</u>
<u n="724" who="S0302" trans="overlap">they don't talk about it</u>
<u n="725" who="S0262" trans="overlap">as well to get divorced in those days</u>
<u n="726" who="S0302" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="727" who="S0262">you couldn't just go well actually I don't <trunc>wan</trunc> like</u>
<u n="728" who="S0302">no</u>
<u n="729" who="S0262">you had to have a real reason and normally that was adultery</u>
<u n="730" who="S0302" trans="overlap">and usually it was adultery yeah yeah</u>
<u n="731" who="S0262">so</u>
<u n="732" who="S0302">so the the they didn't manage to get divorced I presume?</u>
<u n="733" who="S0262">they they got divorced</u>
<u n="734" who="S0302">oh they did?</u>
<u n="735" who="S0262">they did granny pretty much hightailed it out of erm <pause dur="short"/> you know <anon type="place"/> which is all the farmy people down there they all knew each other and you know how <unclear/> small very small village in Wales <pause dur="short"/> and she just hightailed it and came up to here <pause dur="long"/> she figured out that she needed to leave anyway that's so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> actually went to the same teacher training college as my mother <pause dur="short"/> by one year</u>
<u n="736" who="S0302">no</u>
<u n="737" who="S0262" trans="overlap">they missed each other by one year</u>
<u n="738" who="S0302">oh <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="739" who="S0262">so <pause dur="short"/> when the lecturer the education lecturer said do you know erm a <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she said no I don't <pause dur="short"/> but she'd actually she'd known since the age of eighteen that she had a sister a half-sister</u>
<u n="740" who="S0302" trans="overlap">oh okay right but she didn't wanna see her dad so she didn't wanna</u>
<u n="741" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="742" who="S0302">didn't wanna find out about her</u>
<u n="743" who="S0262">even she told me you know about erm eight or nine years ago she'd actually <trunc>w</trunc> gone past the turning in <anon type="place"/> where she knew where my mum lived <pause dur="short"/> she knew where she lived and she said she'd they'd gone up to an interview at <anon type="place"/> university at her <unclear/> took her up and that oh that's where you know my half-sister lives and I said oh did you think you think to stop to say hello she said well no not really because we'd never met and also the circumstances are a little <pause dur="short"/> strained let's say and I said it's a real shame because my grandmother loved talking about you I'm sure I'm not sure</u>
<u n="744" who="S0302" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="745" who="S0262" trans="overlap">about my mum</u>
<u n="746" who="S0302">yeah</u>

<u n="748" who="S0302">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="749" who="S0262" trans="overlap">cos I just know what my granny was like <pause dur="short"/> anyway and erm</u>
<u n="750" who="S0302">so it sounds like your mum had her in contact then</u>
<u n="751" who="S0262">I <pause dur="short"/> and we'll never know you know and that's the thing is that I'm sure she</u>
<u n="752" who="S0302" trans="overlap">and maybe she just decided oh I don't want anything to do with them</u>
<u n="753" who="S0262">I she did I'm I'm sure that they both of them knew granny my granny and my mum knew</u>

<u n="761" who="S0262">yeah that's right so I just thought that was just a counter thing <pause dur="short"/> but no no no now I think I realise that this was more of a a thing about mum and gran discussing probably <pause dur="long"/> probably discussing matters related to that</u>
<u n="762" who="S0302">yeah</u>
<u n="763" who="S0262">mm <pause dur="short"/> anyway <pause dur="short"/> they both went to the same teacher training college by you know missed out by one year</u>
<u n="764" who="S0302">mm</u>
<u n="765" who="S0262">and that's really quite strange because as erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> told me she said at the time in Wales you know there were a number of teacher training colleges in Wales and she'd applied to really quite a number <pause dur="short"/> and it just</u>
<u n="766" who="S0302" trans="overlap">well yeah</u>
<u n="767" who="S0262">and it wasn't right next to where they all lived either there was</u>

<u n="783" who="S0262">yeah</u>
