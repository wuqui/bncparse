<u n="236" who="S0653">diplodocus no but it looks sort of slightly like a diplodocus but the reason why they have these legends is because at some point they will've seen you know the fossilised prints of a dinosaur and thought oh what was that? that must've been a big animal that used to walk on the Earth and is no longer or there's often legends about giants you know?</u>
<u n="237" who="S0655">oh yeah</u>

<u n="302" who="S0653">I mean it's not necessarily true <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> it's just that people have found something that looks like that could be there</u>
<u n="303" who="S0655">well</u>
<u n="304" who="S0653">but it's like the legend of the green children isn't it? they've all</u>
<u n="305" who="S0655" trans="overlap">huh?</u>
<u n="306" who="S0653">I tell you that all the time the the green children of Woolpit which is a village in Suffolk near to where I used to teach and it's</u>
<u n="307" who="S0655" trans="overlap">oh la la</u>
<u n="308" who="S0653">er and it's recorded in a couple of different books and it's about the story of these the <trunc>broth</trunc> this brother and sister that were found by other children in the village and they were completely green in their complexion in their skin and the boy was kind of very sad and died but the girl eventually er she would only eat green beans for a long time but then she did eventually eat other things and then she lost her green ness on her skin and learnt to talk and she then explained to them that they came from a different place erm and where it was always dark all the time and that they heard music so they followed the music and they came out into the sunlight and there they were and then eventually she marries a local person</u>
<u n="309" who="S0654" trans="overlap">but why did the boy die?</u>
<u n="310" who="S0653">cos he didn't want to be there and he just sort of pined away and didn't eat</u>
<u n="311" who="S0655">what does pined away mean?</u>
<u n="312" who="S0653">when you're really sad about something and you want to kind of go back to somewhere you kind of give up but it's such an interesting story oh and <trunc>Wool</trunc>Woolpit which is a village forty minutes from here it <trunc>r</trunc>originally means wolf pit so they found these children in a wolf pit and as I say</u>
<u n="313" who="S0655" trans="overlap"><unclear>oh yeah?</unclear></u>
<u n="314" who="S0653">it's in two er written twice <trunc>do</trunc>two different writings and I just think it's there must be something behind there mustn't there? there must be some sort of truth because it's got records of her baptism and things in a church</u>
<u n="315" who="S0655">what?</u>
<u n="316" who="S0653">and I</u>
<u n="317" who="S0655" trans="overlap">that is just <trunc>may</trunc></u>
<u n="318" who="S0653" trans="overlap">it's a bit weird isn't it?</u>
<u n="319" who="S0655">mm well actually there was this lady who ate loads and loads and loads of carrots and her skin eventually got an orange tinge to it</u>
<u n="320" who="S0653" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="321" who="S0655">so that so they might've actually become green from eating all that green food</u>
<u n="322" who="S0653">well and especially if she was in a place where they were hiding in caves or something so she didn't have any sunlight perhaps her face would've been green but I</u>
<u n="323" who="S0655">or she would've just felt very ill</u>
<u n="324" who="S0653">yeah but I've always found it really interesting</u>
<u n="325" who="S0655" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="326" who="S0653">and the fact they didn't speak any English for years I just find it fascinating there must be some sort of truth behind that particular <trunc>le</trunc>legend I think or there's a <trunc>f</trunc> er legend based on a place in erm called Swaffham in Norfolk about now I won't be able to remember all of it but about a man who had a dream that he was going to find riches in London so he went all the way to London</u>
<u n="327" who="S0654">oh yeah</u>

<u n="333" who="S0655">Dick Whittington?</u>
<u n="334" who="S0653">no it's not Dick Whittington but it's very similar he met somebody who told him that she or he or she'd had a dream about someone finding treasure in their own back garden so he then went all the way back to Swaffham dug up his garden and then there was loads of treasure in the back garden</u>
<u n="335" who="S0654"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="336" who="S0653">and again you just think well there must be some kind of truth about it because it's a named person in a particular village</u>

<u n="338" who="S0654" whoConfidence="low"><unclear/></u>

<u n="349" who="S0655" trans="overlap">I'm guessing that they said they would find their riches in London and he kind of did</u>
<u n="350" who="S0653">well he kind of did and he needed to make that journey and that's the hero's journey isn't it? is that actually he could've just if the dream had been more specific he could've just <trunc>du</trunc> you know dug up his back garden but the point of it was that he travelled all that way and learnt lots of things and er kind of found himself discovered who he was but it's a really good story isn't it? I think</u>
<u n="351" who="S0655">who was he? a person who dug a person who digs in his back garden but doesn't plant flowers?</u>
