<u n="43" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> I'm I'm not telling <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if it definitely killed them but like</u>
<u n="44" who="S0115">you mean that someone died eating the the sauce yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0037">no no no no <pause dur="short"/> it didn't like just like choke on it <pause dur="short"/> it had something horrible in it like I don't know <pause dur="short"/> like campylobacter or some really horrible</u>
<u n="46" who="S0115">yeah like salmonella or something</u>
<u n="47" who="S0037">I don't know I'll have to google it <pause dur="short"/> it had like</u>

<u n="50" who="S0115">and someone ate that and and died of and er</u>
<u n="51" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I think it was pasta sauces <pause dur="short"/> but they all had to be recalled <pause dur="short"/> there was like a massive product recall <pause dur="short"/> and I just thought I just thought about</u>
<u n="52" who="S0115" trans="overlap">he'd have to do  he'd have to do  where they'd have to be destroyed so he'd have to lots of mini impressions of himself being burnt so it would be quite</u>
<u n="53" who="S0037">like like a pyre of Lloyd Grossman sauces</u>
<u n="54" who="S0115">it it will be quite upsetting erm to see all those mini mes being sort of burnt</u>
<u n="55" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well but I'm sure it I'm sure it's Lloyd Grossman <pause dur="short"/> maybe I've got that completely wrong <pause dur="short"/> it's probably slanderous</u>
<u n="56" who="S0115">one of something like that yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0037">anyway but yeah I think Masterchef's on</u>
<u n="58" who="S0115">erm <pause dur="short"/> that's a risk <pause dur="short"/> that's cool</u>
<u n="59" who="S0037">but the thing is though unless</u>
<u n="60" who="S0115" trans="overlap">er <unclear/> different now isn't it because we've had so much more cooking programmes</u>
<u n="61" who="S0037">mm</u>
<u n="62" who="S0115">that kind of explosion of cooking recently</u>
<u n="63" who="S0037" trans="overlap">oh good them them horrible baker boys <pause dur="short"/> oh they're so annoying <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I can watch them</u>
<u n="64" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I've seen them <pause dur="short"/> they're er</u>
<u n="65" who="S0037">they're so annoying</u>
<u n="66" who="S0115">they're sort of two little Gordon Ramseys or something</u>
<u n="67" who="S0037">no they're not even like that <pause dur="short"/> they're just so like public school <pause dur="short"/> and like oh the first one to make the most tasty chapatti wins <pause dur="short"/> what ho <pause dur="short"/> it's like don't you think it's really annoying?</u>
<u n="68" who="S0115">I think it's quite fake <pause dur="short"/> it looks quite like they're pretending to be like very competitive <unclear/></u>
<u n="69" who="S0037" trans="overlap">and they're living this like they in this idyllic place where just like he's the butcher and I'm the baker and my other sister's the candlestick maker or something <pause dur="short"/> it's just stupid <pause dur="short"/> that might be a lie</u>
<u n="70" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well they're  they're living  they're living the <pause dur="short"/> I know well they're supposed to live in in two shops next door to each other <pause dur="short"/> one of them one of them is a butcher and then one of them is a baker and then</u>
<u n="71" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well I think it's just bull <pause dur="short"/> well I think it's just made up <pause dur="short"/> I think it's a set <pause dur="short"/> I think they're just actors <pause dur="short"/> it's all a lie</u>
<u n="72" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0037">anyway what I was saying originally</u>
<u n="74" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well yeah it does look  a bit  a bit fake actually yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0037">what I was saying before about MasterChef was like <pause dur="short"/> did you see? I think  I think I think  originally it was like erm in Australia they changed the format and made it really like <event desc="sound of fire"/> with flames and like chop you know really dramatic and like making people cry and shouting at them <pause dur="short"/> and so over here they changed the format because if you remember a few series ago like Greg Wallace and Jonty Rhodes weren't even like</u>
<u n="76" who="S0115">his his name for the record is John Torode</u>
<u n="77" who="S0037">no it's not it's Jonty <pause dur="short"/> anyway like no because  a few  a few series ago it was like erm just normal like hello Mary what are you cooking? and now it's like <event desc="sound of fire"/> the contestants will never survive <pause dur="short"/> it's like</u>
<u n="78" who="S0115">yeah it's more like er something that would have Arnold Schwarzenegger rather than like than sort of Fanny Craddock or whatever</u>
<u n="79" who="S0037" trans="overlap">like yeah it's like action cooking <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0115">mind you <pause dur="short"/> she is she's a bit scary a little bit</u>
<u n="81" who="S0037" trans="overlap">with the eyebrows <pause dur="short"/> did you see  did you see  her eyebrows?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0115">yeah I mean I I think  I think I think  she could take on Schwarzenegger like</u>
<u n="83" who="S0037" trans="overlap">what was her helper? What was her little called again?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0115">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> er Oddjob?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember <pause dur="short"/> no I don't think it was Oddjob</u>
<u n="86" who="S0115">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I don't know like er</u>
<u n="87" who="S0037">he was like her sort of obedient husband and she used to like shout at him and stuff <pause dur="short"/> have you ever seen it? It's sometimes on like</u>
<u n="88" who="S0115" trans="overlap">that's that's disturbing actually</u>
<u n="89" who="S0037">I don't really see it because we haven't got a <unclear/> at home</u>
<u n="90" who="S0115">you don't  you don't  have a like a box set of a</u>
<u n="91" who="S0037">no but there's all those food channels like we haven't got them <pause dur="short"/> just because we've got Freeview</u>
<u n="92" who="S0115">oh yeah well there's that American one isn't there when he he his his purpose is to sort of eat as much as he can before he sort of dies</u>
<u n="93" who="S0037" trans="overlap">man Versus Food?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0037">oh he's a pig him</u>
<u n="96" who="S0115">he he sort of he has a show called the America's Greediest Person or something and then yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0037">man <pause dur="short"/> man Versus Food</u>
<u n="98" who="S0115">oh right yeah <pause dur="short"/> and er mind you some of the things they ate were tasty-looking but they're just very large yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah it always looks tasty but like a tiny plate of it not like seven you know cows in a bap or something</u>
<u n="100" who="S0115">he's like a Elvis Elvis burger or something</u>
<u n="101" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it's like super chilly <pause dur="short"/> yeah like twenty-five Elvis Elvis burgers and sixteen milkshakes and that <pause dur="short"/> it's like extreme eating but yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0115" trans="overlap">okay <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="103" who="S0037">but yeah I think</u>
<u n="104" who="S0115">do but now so but you actually like watching erm MasterChef don't you?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's nice</u>
<u n="106" who="S0115" trans="overlap">the new one with yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I like I do like I like sort of erm <pause dur="short"/> although I think like the format like I don't mind a bit of exciting jazzy cooking and all that <pause dur="short"/> like who knows what's going to happen this week? I like I don't really mind that but I think like this time one thing they've changed in this series that's just started is that like the erm the contestants <pause dur="short"/> it feels like so they do the first bit where they've got like the invention thing and they get all different ingredients and they have to make something <pause dur="short"/> and then but then straight away after that I think they've already kicked like one person off <pause dur="short"/> and then straight away after that it's like the bit where they'd have to go in a restaurant <pause dur="short"/> so like the first of all they make beans on toast and then next think they're down like you know The Savoy Hotel like rustling up some <trunc>fr</trunc> foie gras or something <pause dur="short"/> it just seems a bit extreme <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="108" who="S0115">yeah they it seems extremely hard to to work in that high-pressure environment in in a big you know proper posh restaurant like it seems <pause dur="short"/> there's still a kind of like</u>
<u n="109" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I think I wouldn't like <pause dur="short"/> sorry <pause dur="short"/> yeah when they send it back and it's like that dribble is one millimetre too big and all that</u>
<u n="110" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's I think ex-military chef</u>
<u n="111" who="S0037" trans="overlap">the foam isn't foamy enough</u>
<u n="112" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0037">but I think it's why I don't think I'd like to be a chef because like erm I don't think I'd like the hours</u>
<u n="114" who="S0115">yeah the oh yeah actually because it is a bit sort of well you've got a lunch one that's alright <pause dur="short"/> er er</u>
<u n="115" who="S0037">no but you can't just say I'm going to be like a lunchtime chef</u>
<u n="116" who="S0115">you could <pause dur="short"/> do they not have that? Do they not?</u>
<u n="117" who="S0037" trans="overlap">that's a dinner lady</u>
<u n="118" who="S0115">that I considered being like a chef and I think if I had been a chef I would have wanted to work in during brunch and lunch</u>
<u n="119" who="S0037">dinner lady then</u>
<u n="120" who="S0115">er supposing so <pause dur="short"/> tuck tuck shop and er</u>
<u n="121" who="S0037"><trunc>D</trunc> <trunc>J</trunc> done it <pause dur="short"/> so like what happens if you're a man and you were a dinner lady? Do you get called like a dinner man?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0115">er just chef I think er</u>
<u n="123" who="S0037">well that seems a bit sexist if the dinner ladies are called the dinner ladies</u>
<u n="124" who="S0115">yeah well that's just composition really I mean that's what they are isn't it? They're <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> they er he's erm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0037" trans="overlap">maybe like with the political correctness maybe they're like dinner persons or something <pause dur="short"/> lunchtime operatives <pause dur="short"/> I bet  I bet</u>
<u n="126" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="127" who="S0037">the lunchtime <pause dur="short"/> lunchtime facilitation operative</u>
<u n="128" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I like operative but the special special operations at lunch or something</u>
<u n="129" who="S0037">lunchtime nourishment facilitator or something</u>
<u n="130" who="S0115">but other that's that's amazing er but I think if you can't do the lunch shift then you've then got to sort of hang around from lunch till like evening</u>
<u n="131" who="S0037">but do they not have to prep loads of stuff <pause dur="short"/> like on <trunc>kit</trunc> Gordon Ramsey's thing they have to like shave loads of like carrots and that and otherwise known as peel <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="132" who="S0115"><unclear/> shaved carrots <pause dur="short"/> do they call it shaven when they? It's peeling isn't it?</u>
<u n="133" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I don't think they do <pause dur="short"/> yeah I'm just being stupid</u>
<u n="134" who="S0115">not a skinning the carrot or something</u>
<u n="135" who="S0037">no but do you know what I mean? They've got to like chop things and like</u>
<u n="136" who="S0115">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah I mean I guess well er they probably have like masses of stuff like frozen as well or or</u>
<u n="137" who="S0037">I don't know</u>
<u n="138" who="S0115">they have to make it in bulk or something so like a bit pot or something</u>
<u n="139" who="S0037" trans="overlap">do they not like turn their noses up at them kind of things like</u>
<u n="140" who="S0115">I well I think they're saying that they might say  they might say  they do but I think they maybe secretly <pause dur="short"/> I think there is a lot of defrosting and microwaving that goes on <pause dur="short"/> behind the scenes</u>
<u n="141" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah but sometimes like they must have to half cook like <pause dur="short"/> they must have to like half cook stuff because like otherwise like they wouldn't be able to do stuff would they <pause dur="short"/> some things <pause dur="short"/> some things just take a long time to cook <pause dur="short"/> like if you are slow roasting things they must have to half do them <pause dur="short"/> the same as like when you go out for food <pause dur="short"/> like when you go to Wetherspoon's and you ask for like a roast dinner and it comes after like seven minutes <pause dur="short"/> it's like hmm</u>
<u n="142" who="S0115">erm those are probably microwaved aren't they</u>
<u n="143" who="S0037">I know</u>
<u n="144" who="S0115">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but not not bad though</u>
<u n="145" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it's a bit disturbing really isn't it really when you think about it</u>
<u n="146" who="S0115">what?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0037">like radiating your food</u>
<u n="148" who="S0115">oh you mean the science behind microwaving <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="149" who="S0037">do you not think?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0115">it's just a bit space-agey <pause dur="short"/> it's a bit sort of <unclear/> you know that's has that happening er that shouldn't <trunc>ha</trunc> shouldn't work</u>
<u n="151" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0115">erm obviously radio waves go through our heads all the time don't they <pause dur="short"/> like when we're on the mobile phone or something but they have different ones</u>
<u n="153" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah but I mean to purposely do that to eat your dinner seems a bit weird</u>
<u n="154" who="S0115">how they found it out must be quite interesting <pause dur="short"/> must have been having some fun</u>
<u n="155" who="S0037">yeah like accidentally left his sandwich</u>
<u n="156" who="S0115" trans="overlap">er blasting each blasting themselves and various food items with radiation must have had a cracking cracking afternoon erm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0037">I don't even miss one like cos obviously we haven't got enough room but I don't even miss it <pause dur="short"/> having not not having a microwave</u>
<u n="158" who="S0115">erm so a microwave yeah it's to do with the er frequency and I think it's to do with the water molecules vibrating or something</u>
<u n="159" who="S0037">mm <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="160" who="S0115">erm and there's some stuff you can't put in isn't there <pause dur="short"/> like you can't put metal in <unclear/></u>
<u n="161" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah like when you're <pause dur="short"/> I got really like shouted at home when I put like they've got like a plate with like a golden edge or something and I put a dinner in the microwave it was like <event desc="sound of electrical malfunction"/> and I was thinking oh crap like it's killed the microwave but I just killed the plate so</u>
<u n="162" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0037">no <unclear/> wasn't impressed but never mind</u>
<u n="164" who="S0115">no she's she's no <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
