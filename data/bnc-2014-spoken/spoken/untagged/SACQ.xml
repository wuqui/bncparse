<u n="3" who="S0179">oh great <pause dur="short"/> so basically it's just gonna give you a lot more time in the day</u>
<u n="4" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> basically <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's just</u>
<u n="5" who="S0179">oh God</u>
<u n="6" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> look at him <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> He's gonna put anyone off drug addiction isn't he <pause dur="short"/> surely</u>
<u n="7" who="S0179">one would've assumed</u>
<u n="8" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh <pause dur="short"/> is it fair to compare? Yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh there's um some personal training there <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Doing a nice stretch <pause dur="short"/> slash personal personal trainer getting cosy</u>
<u n="9" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> It's a problem</u>
<u n="11" who="S0179">okay so there's two interesting articles here <pause dur="short"/> one is that comparison</u>
<u n="12" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="13" who="S0179">cUP's</u>
<u n="14" who="S0058">oo <pause dur="short"/> here we are <pause dur="short"/> ah <pause dur="short"/> yes indeed <pause dur="short"/> so the bookshop yeah it's the oldest bookselling site in Britain <pause dur="short"/> we haven't been there all that time but it's been a bookshop since <trunc>fift</trunc> at least fifteen eighty-one <pause dur="short"/> that's really cool <pause dur="long"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> no it's a  it's a  lovely shop</u>
<u n="15" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0058">oh that's interesting <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah there was a lot of um oh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> indeed another English er English fellow there <pause dur="short"/> was he an English student? Does it tell you?</u>
<u n="17" who="S0179">er I think he was <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="18" who="S0058">that would explain why there were so many English fellows coming out</u>
<u n="19" who="S0179">to be fair it wasn't the best thing to do in the world</u>
<u n="20" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="21" who="S0179">it wasn't hugely appropriate</u>
<u n="22" who="S0058">no no <pause dur="short"/> I don't think it was <pause dur="short"/> I don't think it was a very clever way of <trunc>d</trunc> participating in a</u>
<u n="23" who="S0179">well this is the thing that's fucking me off <pause dur="short"/> so it it's sort of punished for being thoughtful principled talented and brave <pause dur="short"/> also being a bit of an arse</u>
<u n="24" who="S0058">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean er</u>
<u n="25" who="S0179">I think er I think he should</u>
<u n="26" who="S0058">er I guess <trunc>pu</trunc> putting your hand up and arguing is a better</u>
<u n="27" who="S0179">I think I I don't think it's entirely unreasonable that they were punished for that</u>
<u n="28" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0179">um but</u>
<u n="30" who="S0058">but that seems</u>
<u n="31" who="S0179">possibly not to that degree</u>
<u n="32" who="S0058">exactly <pause dur="short"/> I mean <vocal desc="laugh"/> no pun intended that seems a bit extreme <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="33" who="S0179">well it depends er you know if you know someone has organized something and you turn up to it it's not then up to you to dictate how that goes</u>
<u n="34" who="S0058">no no <pause dur="short"/> entirely</u>
<u n="35" who="S0179">hence the point <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="36" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0179">the students of <anon type="place"/> like slaves in ancient Greece <pause dur="short"/> probably not</u>
<u n="38" who="S0058">what cos they're not allowed to speak out? Is that the the idea?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0179">er yes <pause dur="short"/> except I don't think that's <trunc>va</trunc> I mean the the University has done some interesting things in its <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>l</trunc></u>
<u n="40" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0179">sort of last year or two of history <pause dur="short"/> that's not the most and to be fair that wasn't actually the University <pause dur="short"/> that was an external er</u>
<u n="42" who="S0058">it was what sorry?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0179">that was an external court proceeding <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="44" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0179">dr <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the senior proctor who first reported Holland as the ring-leader called defenders apologists</u>
<u n="48" who="S0058">what? Apologists for the?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> they could not charge the other protestors cos they did not know enough names <pause dur="short"/> wrecking seminars is wrong</u>
<u n="50" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean to a certain extent yeah <pause dur="short"/> because then he didn't speak <pause dur="short"/> he didn't continue to speak <pause dur="short"/> which in stopping someone from speaking isn't the best way of</u>
<u n="51" who="S0179">er er er well</u>
<u n="52" who="S0058">kind of</u>
<u n="53" who="S0179">he he said Holland denied many people the right to engage with the minister <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> if someone's <trunc>makin</trunc> being stupid</u>
<u n="54" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0179">you show them up for their stupidity through reasoned</u>
<u n="56" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0179">intellectual discussion</u>
<u n="58" who="S0058"><trunc>Tha</trunc> that's what I mean <pause dur="short"/> like it's not the best way of proving that you're kind of yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0179">I mean the problem is that's essentially what the government was doing um was basically denying the students a forum <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="60" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0179"><trunc>h</trunc> er but locally in that instance</u>
<u n="62" who="S0058">yes</u>
<u n="63" who="S0179">that wasn't the problem <pause dur="short"/> huh <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> anyway so where's this er fresh from being dubbed third best in the world <pause dur="short"/> third? Excuse me</u>

<u n="67" who="S0179">hm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0058">league table you're looking at <pause dur="short"/> because um <anon type="place"/>'s sometimes top</u>
<u n="69" who="S0179">er</u>
<u n="70" who="S0058">and MIT's sometimes top depending on what metric you're using</u>
<u n="71" who="S0179">MIT's virtually never top</u>
<u n="72" who="S0058">is it not?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0179">it's often second but</u>
<u n="74" who="S0058">so <trunc>w</trunc> there's no there's normally three isn't there <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="83" who="S0179">fff</u>
<u n="84" who="S0058">just don't put them playing against each other because it's gonna be boring <pause dur="short"/> it's far more interesting <vocal desc="laugh"/> to go and watch <anon type="place"/> play <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="85" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0058">and watch Man U play Chelsea like don't you know <vocal desc="laugh"/> they're good for different things <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="103" who="S0179">less than a <vocal desc="laugh"/> thousand academic staff <pause dur="short"/> that's a contrast ratio</u>
<u n="104" who="S0058">wow <pause dur="short"/> that is interesting</u>
<u n="105" who="S0179">so it's got six times fewer staff <pause dur="short"/> nearly twice the students</u>
<u n="106" who="S0058">that's really interesting actually <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> well they do say like that's the point of <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> that you get really kind of <pause dur="short"/> what do you count as academic staff though? Do you not do you count sort of postdoc?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0179">yes</u>
