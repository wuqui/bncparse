<u n="212" who="S0429">that you <trunc>abs</trunc> they they're not they they become almost caricatures of themselves also like anyone that tries to practice things in real life</u>
<u n="213" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="214" who="S0429">and you can tell it so badly and it's suddenly just like ah this is tragic rather than actually being funny or</u>
<u n="215" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but then also</u>
<u n="216" who="S0429">but then living your whole life thinking well is this funny? is is what I'm saying funny? it's like I don't know I <trunc>fi</trunc> cos at at one point I just thought that was the best thing</u>
<u n="217" who="S0428">but do you not also think that like in real life they're so much funnier than on telly? cos at Christmas mum bought us tickets to see Omid Djalili</u>
<u n="218" who="S0429">oh yeah</u>
<u n="219" who="S0428" trans="overlap">and I've never liked him I've always just thought he was a complete idiot</u>

<u n="224" who="S0429" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="225" who="S0428">at a comedian <pause dur="short"/> so I think as well</u>
<u n="226" who="S0429" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="227" who="S0428">like when you're in the presence of some like</u>
<u n="228" who="S0429" trans="overlap">definitely</u>

<u n="230" who="S0430" trans="overlap">the live the live experience makes a massive difference</u>
<u n="231" who="S0429" trans="overlap">definitely well cos <pause dur="short"/> no I think that of Russell Howard like I I don't I would never really watch Russell Howard and I <trunc>w</trunc> probably would laugh at his jokes if it was on if I <trunc>ha</trunc> end up watching it and yet when I saw him live I thought he was actually really funny and that's how they've got to where they are is cos</u>
<u n="232" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="233" who="S0430" trans="overlap">do you mean Russell Kane?</u>
<u n="234" who="S0429">no no Rushell Russell Howard because Russell Kane I think's amazing</u>
<u n="235" who="S0428">yeah he's good anyway</u>
<u n="236" who="S0430" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="237" who="S0429">but terrible on TV but amazing yeah</u>
<u n="238" who="S0430">mm</u>
<u n="239" who="S0429">no I think I think it's massively in the room and and also I think there's a lot of people that can't put that warmth across</u>
<u n="240" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="241" who="S0429">the TV rather than</u>
<u n="242" who="S0430">I saw as well the last time to be fair on <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the last time I saw him erm my friend who's a big reviewer spoke to me and said he'd heard that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was erm doing this experiment at Edinburgh where basically half of his shows during the month he was doing his normal show that he'd prepared and written all year</u>
<u n="243" who="S0428">yeah and then he wasn't funny at all because my friend <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> went to go and see him and was like totally flopped</u>
<u n="244" who="S0430">yeah so on the other half</u>
<u n="245" who="S0429" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="246" who="S0430">of the shows he was apparently challenging himself to see if he could do improv</u>
<u n="247" who="S0429">right</u>
<u n="248" who="S0430">where basically he was going in with no material</u>
<u n="249" who="S0429">god</u>
<u n="250" who="S0430">and seeing if he could last an hour without any material and I must have seen him on one</u>
<u n="251" who="S0429" trans="overlap">see</u>
<u n="252" who="S0430">of those nights and it was one of the worst shows I've ever seen</u>
<u n="253" who="S0429" trans="overlap">but <trunc>weirdl</trunc> weirdly I think you need in order to do it's like you know what they say when you just train so hard for something you know it instinctively so you don't need to have a massive backup of knowledge because you know it you've done it so many times you know what to do</u>
<u n="254" who="S0430">mm</u>
<u n="255" who="S0429">and yet I don't like that's what he hasn't got so or you need that like flair where you're just</u>
<u n="256" who="S0430" trans="overlap">also I don't think you <pause dur="short"/> also if you're gonna do that</u>
<u n="257" who="S0428" trans="overlap">probably</u>
<u n="258" who="S0430">I think the audience probably need to know</u>
<u n="259" who="S0429">yeah yeah they do yeah</u>
<u n="260" who="S0428" trans="overlap">and they</u>
<u n="261" who="S0430" trans="overlap">and I was really annoyed because I was like he'd won newcomer the year before and people will be buying tickets spending money on him</u>
<u n="262" who="S0429" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="263" who="S0430">because of that and thinking oh I'm gonna see a really polished comedian and instead half of the festival he was technically ripping people off <vocal desc="laugh"/> cos he was doing something for his own indulgence to see whether or not he could last a</u>
<u n="264" who="S0428">but I think that's him it's kind of like</u>
<u n="265" who="S0429" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="266" who="S0430">yeah</u>
<u n="267" who="S0428">cos he is just a bit like that and he is just</u>
<u n="268" who="S0429" trans="overlap">that's</u>
<u n="269" who="S0428">I remember when I met him</u>
<u n="270" who="S0429" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="271" who="S0428">we were at the we were at this like house party in Norway and I was like</u>
<u n="272" who="S0430"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="273" who="S0428">who's that weirdo? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="274" who="S0430"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="275" who="S0428">honestly it was it was <trunc>h</trunc> he was so funny I don't think for that whole week where me and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> were in Norway we stopped laughing</u>
<u n="276" who="S0429">really?</u>
<u n="277" who="S0428">he was so funny</u>
<u n="278" who="S0430">mm</u>
<u n="279" who="S0428">between the three of them</u>
<u n="280" who="S0429" trans="overlap">and also yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0428"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="282" who="S0429">there is a certain like but you've gotta have balls to do that you know like the Man on the Moon? he's that I can't <trunc>reme</trunc> Andy Kaufman</u>
<u n="283" who="S0430">oh yeah</u>
<u n="284" who="S0429">do have you seen Andy Kaufman? he was this amazing comedian and he used to just come onstage and he'd do like he'd just do chicken noises for like half an hour and walk off or something or he'd say nothing and he was so controversial and yet now he's like revered you know like everyone think's he's amazing</u>
<u n="285" who="S0430" trans="overlap">he's idolised <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="286" who="S0429">and yet you can imagine people coming away from that going they've just wasted my <trunc>t</trunc> he's wasted my time for half an hour in in a way there's some quite ballsy going to Edinburgh where it's so tough anyway and then going right I'm not gonna write half my stuff I'm just gonna do it as like there is something amazing about it like this and quite arrogant but there's something amazing</u>
<u n="287" who="S0428" trans="overlap">but but also like cos when the whole point of stand up is that it's supposed to be completely natural so therefore like you're supposed to come across as kind of</u>
<u n="288" who="S0429" trans="overlap">but</u>
<u n="289" who="S0428">I know it's not</u>
<u n="290" who="S0429" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="291" who="S0428">but it's supposed to come across as something that's like completely spontaneous and that's why it's so funny</u>
<u n="292" who="S0429" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="293" who="S0428">so I can totally see why someone would want to kind of recreate that</u>
<u n="294" who="S0429">yeah but weirdly it's that kind of thing isn't it? it's that I've been to so many er there's this one night in London called <trunc>o</trunc> old rope and you sort of think that er it's where people come across and they do new material and if they haven't done any er preparation and they're literally doing new material they can't remember that they can't do it and if they're a new comedian it just it always flops it always does unless they've got this kind of amazing there is few people that can have that kind of eloquence and just this speed of mind or whatever that can make it funny hardly anyone can I think unless they've got this amazing like backlog of comedy so they can just they've got stuff to go back to</u>
<u n="295" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="296" who="S0429">or they know how to build so and like I've seen people just completely flounder and not like just bomb and yet they're funny if you watch <unclear/> they're really funny</u>
<u n="297" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="298" who="S0429">they construct their jokes well and they can learn to deliver them well <pause dur="short"/> but it's two <trunc>complete</trunc> I think that's two completely different types of people</u>
<u n="299" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="300" who="S0429">or people that have just done it a long time they know how to do it</u>
<u n="301" who="S0428">it's really rare</u>
<u n="302" who="S0429" trans="overlap">but you're right it's stripping it back to what it should be <unclear>like</unclear></u>
<u n="303" who="S0428" trans="overlap">but it's it's really rare it's really rare to like I don't know it's really rare to find someone that probably could be that naturally funny</u>
<u n="304" who="S0429">there is someone there is someone but then he's done it for years <pause dur="short"/> there is like I that this guy Daniel Kitson who you would love if you're ever in London he's got a gig on</u>
<u n="305" who="S0428" trans="overlap">we should go next time he's on we'll</u>
<u n="306" who="S0429" trans="overlap">no you should go next time he's on basically he's got</u>
<u n="307" who="S0428" trans="overlap">just buy tickets and we'll go</u>
<u n="308" who="S0429">so you've got this mailing list it's thousands of <trunc>peo</trunc> twenty thousand people isn't it?</u>
<u n="309" who="S0430">twenty-seven thousand</u>
<u n="310" who="S0429">twenty-seven thousand people he's not been on TV since he was on Phoenix Nights you would love him he's completely <unclear/> my <unclear/> completely your mindset and he's like he's got this</u>
<u n="311" who="S0430" trans="overlap">he doesn't really do gigs bigger than like eighty people or whatever</u>
<u n="312" who="S0429" trans="overlap">he does tiny gigs he no occasionally</u>
<u n="313" who="S0428" trans="overlap">that's just brilliant though</u>
<u n="314" who="S0429">he does them at the National Theatre</u>
<u n="315" who="S0430">he does big yeah he does those big <unclear>ones</unclear></u>
<u n="316" who="S0429" trans="overlap">and he charges twelve quid to go in like you can go to the National Theatre</u>
<u n="317" who="S0428" trans="overlap">okay let's let's try and get tickets and just go</u>
<u n="318" who="S0429" trans="overlap">so I'll <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> yeah I'll tell you about cos you would love him</u>
<u n="319" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="320" who="S0429">I tell you <trunc>when</trunc>whenever he's gigging literally you have to get them straight away so I'll just book you a ticket and tell you when it's on</u>
<u n="321" who="S0428">mm mm</u>
<u n="322" who="S0429">erm and if you can't come that's fine but like</u>
<u n="323" who="S0428" trans="overlap">that's really <unclear>close</unclear></u>
<u n="324" who="S0429">it's er yeah it his shows are phenomenal and he can I've been to see so many er like early on material gigs and they they're always good cos he can just talk and he when he talks it's funny but I don't know hardly anyone that can do that and he's been doing it for years</u>
<u n="325" who="S0430">it's rare to find someone who can do both because you get really good MCs people who can do those nights where they just introduce somebody else and they're on to do filler like Jarred Christmas is really good at MCing and talking to people he's actually a really funny comic like just doing the bits in between but if you probably pay to see a full polished hour from him you probably come away thinking oh</u>
<u n="326" who="S0429" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0430">it's it's there's some shortcomings in it</u>
<u n="328" who="S0429">mm</u>
<u n="329" who="S0428">but do you so you know you do these comedy programmes but do you actually meet all the people in them or do never kind of go on set? or</u>

<u n="431" who="S0429" trans="overlap">no but we</u>
<u n="432" who="S0428" trans="overlap">but that's kind of worse is it not?</u>
<u n="433" who="S0429">no it's way worse like legally though because er Big Brother like I worked in <unclear>Big Brother</unclear> you're only allowed to give them a certain amount of alcohol you cannot give them much alcohol at all like if they get really drunk but they're not actually that drunk because you can only give them very kind of and that must be the same for Geordie Shore but it's not because they can just do whatever they want so you don't ever give them alcohol like I doubt they ever give them alcohol on Geordie Shore</u>
<u n="434" who="S0430" trans="overlap">well I'm</u>
<u n="435" who="S0429">cos you're not allowed to you're not allowed to give them <unclear/></u>
<u n="436" who="S0430" trans="overlap">yeah but that's not</u>
<u n="437" who="S0429">that much alcohol legally on Big Brother that's why you have to</u>
<u n="438" who="S0428" trans="overlap">surely Big Brother was like the first show where kind of that happened on telly?</u>
<u n="439" who="S0430">probably</u>
<u n="440" who="S0429">yeah yeah I think you're right yeah</u>
<u n="441" who="S0428" trans="overlap">social experiment and</u>
<u n="442" who="S0429">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah it was</u>
<u n="443" who="S0430">I think we spoke to someone we spoke to legal about it and it was like if you buy a drink and you put drink somewhere and they then take the drink then</u>
<u n="444" who="S0429" trans="overlap">yeah fair enough</u>
<u n="445" who="S0430">you would <trunc>pa</trunc> you are then passing your responsibility to them for having the drink</u>
<u n="446" who="S0429" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> well maybe maybe</u>
<u n="447" who="S0430" trans="overlap">and that's why it <unclear>helped</unclear> us</u>
<u n="448" who="S0429">well maybe the difference is Big Brother's like a self-contained world it they can't get anything in they can't get anything out</u>
<u n="449" who="S0430">yeah</u>
<u n="450" who="S0429">and so you're basically <unclear/></u>
<u n="451" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah so it's a bit different</u>
<u n="452" who="S0430" trans="overlap">and even you can say</u>
<u n="453" who="S0429">yeah it is</u>
<u n="454" who="S0430">even it was like you can also offer you can say would you like a drink</u>
<u n="455" who="S0429" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="456" who="S0430">it's when you say have this beer have this shot</u>
<u n="457" who="S0429" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="458" who="S0430">have this whatever it is is when we suddenly step onto slightly grey area</u>
<u n="459" who="S0429" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="460" who="S0430">which we didn't do here</u>
<u n="461" who="S0429">you're right though really</u>
<u n="462" who="S0428">I dunno I just feel it's a bit it's a bit like weird in a way that like a programme they're telling histories and they're really funny cos I kind of feel oh that's a really great idea but I didn't necessarily see the need for the people to be drinking it like it could have just been like a</u>
<u n="463" who="S0429">mm</u>
<u n="464" who="S0430">sure</u>
<u n="465" who="S0428">but that was like almost an excuse</u>
<u n="466" who="S0430" trans="overlap">but I guess the funny the funny thing comes when you have</u>
<u n="467" who="S0428" trans="overlap">I haven't seen it so I really</u>
<u n="468" who="S0430" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="469" who="S0428">I've seen the adverts though</u>
<u n="470" who="S0430" trans="overlap">yeah but I guess you know I know what you mean cos I think that it <trunc>woul</trunc> you could still do a funny you know if you gave a comedian a story</u>
<u n="471" who="S0429" trans="overlap">you could definitely do it</u>
<u n="472" who="S0430">they could make it really funny without needing to be drunk</u>
<u n="473" who="S0429" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="474" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="475" who="S0430">but what's quite funny is when they make mistakes that's quite literally the and because the way it works is they create the dialogue for the people that act in</u>
<u n="476" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="477" who="S0430">the erm like like the recreations and people in the recreations have to lip-sync to that dialogue so when they make slip ups and you see like someone who's quite you know popular in the comedy world like Rebecca Front or whoever it is someone who's held in quite high esteem looking like Queen Victoria and it looks like a real old period drama but then they're talking this way</u>
<u n="478" who="S0428" trans="overlap">they're making a mistake</u>
<u n="479" who="S0430">in this slurred voice and all that that's what</u>
<u n="480" who="S0429" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="481" who="S0430">adds the extra layer to it that's slightly different I agree I don't think it necessarily</u>
<u n="482" who="S0429" trans="overlap">it's sort of capturing those stories when you've had too much to drink and you're telling this story you're telling it in a completely different way cos you're drunk</u>
<u n="483" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="484" who="S0429">and there is something funny about that</u>
<u n="485" who="S0430">mm</u>
<u n="486" who="S0429">and yet and and actually the reality of it is that it started off as this kind of quite small thing where like people get drunk tell stories and things</u>
<u n="487" who="S0430" trans="overlap">cult following</u>
<u n="488" who="S0429">and it had a cult following and yet if you came to a channel and said we've got this idea <pause dur="short"/> comedians are gonna tell stories from</u>
<u n="489" who="S0428" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="490" who="S0429">history unless you had a massive comedian that wanted to that was their project there's no no way it would ever get a <unclear>way</unclear> cos it's got always got to have like a hook to it</u>
<u n="491" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's just such a crazy such a crazy world that I've never even really</u>
<u n="492" who="S0430" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="493" who="S0428">but the whole comedy world and <pause dur="short"/> it's crazy that you've ended up in that and that's what you wanted to end up in and it's always really funny where you end up</u>
<u n="494" who="S0429" trans="overlap">yeah but I don't feel like I've ended up anywhere</u>
<u n="495" who="S0428">no?</u>
<u n="496" who="S0429">I feel like I'm in in a place at the moment</u>
<u n="497" who="S0428" trans="overlap">we haven't finished <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="498" who="S0429">I haven't finished <vocal desc="laugh"/> no but I wouldn't be surprised in two years if I'm not if I haven't got anything to do with that</u>
<u n="499" who="S0428">with telly?</u>
<u n="500" who="S0429" trans="overlap">with telly or if I have gone a completely different way</u>
<u n="501" who="S0428">what do you reckon you're gonna</u>
<u n="502" who="S0429">it's no but it's always changing it's always changing I don't think I've found my thing yet</u>
<u n="503" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="504" who="S0429">you know <pause dur="short"/> like you don't you don't know exactly where your life's going in two years</u>

<u n="507" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="508" who="S0429">but I think some people I think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> probably if you asked her she might know more where she might be in two years</u>
<u n="509" who="S0428" trans="overlap">she's happy in her job now than she was at Easter or</u>
<u n="510" who="S0429">I don't know she's stressed by it a lot I think she feels happier with it cos she feels like you know whenever you feel like you're kind of into something <unclear/></u>
<u n="511" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="512" who="S0429">erm you kind of enjoy it a bit more</u>

<u n="515" who="S0428">it must make it easier working</u>

<u n="517" who="S0430" trans="overlap">that makes a big difference</u>
<u n="518" who="S0429">and like <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="519" who="S0430">no she just wanted a <unclear/> while she used to be able to work at home at <anon type="place"/> actually but if she had been working at home like she wouldn't just wouldn't have been able to get on that train with us <unclear>this afternoon</unclear> busy isn't it?</u>
