<u n="656" who="S0189">we'll see like I don't know how we start and what's the first thing we do and everything like that</u>
<u n="657" who="S0192">cool first thing we've gotta do is choose a character</u>
<u n="658" who="S0189">well I guessed that but after that</u>
<u n="659" who="S0192">erm</u>
<u n="660" who="S0189">yeah and then we get the card and we find out whether we're a Cylon or not</u>
<u n="661" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="662" who="S0189">and then after that?</u>
<u n="663" who="S0192">after that we collect our erm skills cards</u>
<u n="664" who="S0189">how do you know what ones you get?</u>
<u n="665" who="S0192">it says it on your card here he's gonna have two yellow two green and one purple</u>
<u n="666" who="S0189">okay</u>

<u n="668" who="S0189">do we use them all at once?</u>
<u n="669" who="S0192">no you bet with them so on the cards it will have two things it will have a number in the corner and one to five five would be a strong betting card one would be a low but it also has an action so you can either use this card to bet with or you can do the action on the card some of the actions allow you to give other people actions the actions are quite different the cards repeat a lot though</u>
<u n="670" who="S0189">er so the <vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="671" who="S0192">so like this one</u>
<u n="672" who="S0189">so this card is er is one?</u>
<u n="673" who="S0192">yeah its betting power is only one</u>
<u n="674" who="S0189">so that's low?</u>
<u n="675" who="S0192">yeah it's out of five</u>
<u n="676" who="S0189">so who do you bet with? the other players?</u>
<u n="677" who="S0192">yeah you work as a team to reach your goal of jumping to Kobol</u>
<u n="678" who="S0189">so what would be the purpose of betting this against someone? I don't understand</u>
<u n="679" who="S0192">so there's gonna be a card here and the card is gonna have a crisis like this</u>
<u n="680" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="681" who="S0192">and the crisis says if you pass then such and such if you fail such and such and then it's got a number thirteen</u>
<u n="682" who="S0189">so</u>
<u n="683" who="S0192">so collectively we need to get the power of thirteen and it's only with these two colours yellow and green</u>
<u n="684" who="S0189">yeah so we can either I can either give this up or I can use its action</u>
<u n="685" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="686" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="687" who="S0192">basically</u>
<u n="688" who="S0189">that's cool</u>
<u n="689" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="690" who="S0189">makes sense</u>
<u n="691" who="S0192">er so it has two functions</u>
<u n="692" who="S0189">yeah oh shit</u>
<u n="693" who="S0192">that's the yellow one fairly complicated <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="694" who="S0189">yeah I know</u>
<u n="695" who="S0192">hopefully won't cause any arguments</u>
<u n="696" who="S0189">well we're playing together so er</u>
<u n="697" who="S0192">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> somebody's not gonna be</u>
<u n="698" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="699" who="S0192">somebody's gonna be either on their own oh that's what I was telling you earlier so when you get halfway to eight when you get to four we get dished out another card another loyalty card to see who's a Cylon now if none of these wheels are in the red so if they're all the blue then there'll be a second Cylon but if er any one of these wheels is in the red by the time we get to four then that there won't be another Cylon they'll become a sympathiser and they'll get sent to the Brig but they're not a Cylon they're a Cylon effectively but they sympathise with the humans</u>
<u n="700" who="S0189">is that your rule or the game's rule?</u>

<u n="702" who="S0189">right</u>
<u n="703" who="S0192">the only rule I've added is every time we jump a basestar goes at the front because sometimes you jump and the board clears and you can pull like five or six cards and no Cylons come on the thing and it can get a bit slow so every time we jump I put a basestar so that means there's always a threat there's always a</u>

<u n="706" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="707" who="S0192">there's always a threat it seemed better that way we've only played that way like twice but it er seemed better so I suggest we do it</u>

<u n="839" who="S0192">to jump to Kobol we wanna find Kobol</u>
<u n="840" who="S0227">oh yeah that's supposed to be earth isn't it?</u>
<u n="841" who="S0192"><trunc>s</trunc> yeah so this is our jump track we need to get up to here and jump to the power of eight every time we jump we draw a card and it will tell us a number we wanna get these numbers to eight so they add together this is only two</u>
<u n="842" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="843" who="S0189">this one has two so that'd be four total so we've jumped twice but we're at a power of four we jump three times we're at a power of six just so happens they're all two</u>
<u n="844" who="S0227">so what happens when you hit eight?</u>
<u n="845" who="S0189">we win the game</u>
<u n="846" who="S0227">oh right</u>
<u n="847" who="S0192">so we've gotta jump to er to <trunc>Ko</trunc>to Kobol and then we jump one more time and then we win</u>
<u n="848" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="849" who="S0192">so it's a little bit complicated so I'll just explain it as we go along okay?</u>
<u n="850" who="S0189">sounds good</u>
<u n="851" who="S0227">yeah</u>

<u n="1004" who="S0227">am I allowed to look at these?</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0192">yeah course you are we use these to bet so if you look at the card it has a strength at the top</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0227"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1007" who="S0192">like a number between one and five and we use them to bet that's their strength but you can also use them in <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="1008" who="S0227">is one good or or five good?</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0192">five's good one's bad so three would be medium</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0227">mm okay</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0192">we use them to bet you'll see when it comes round and it's also got an action on it so you can either chose to use the card for its action or you can bet with it and like do it</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0227">okay</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0192">as it goes along right <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> so you got your cards are you gonna move?</u>

<u n="1019" who="S0192">you have to do an action</u>
<u n="1020" who="S0189">okay so if I wanna do an action I should probably move to somewhere useful</u>
<u n="1021" who="S0192">yeah so these ships here can be destroyed we don't want them to be destroyed we wanna protect them so you probably wanna go into that area so that should any ships come over these are actually meant to be over here they will they'll attack you before they attack these</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0189">yeah okay that makes sense</u>
<u n="1023" who="S0192">so you move there?</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="1025" who="S0192">cool now you get an action</u>

<u n="1037" who="S0192">what does it do?</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0189">which is risk one raptor to roll a die if three or higher look at the top card of the crisis or destination dig and place it on the top or the bottom</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0192">okay so this is the crisis card do you wanna do that? we only have four raptors in the whole game but you can risk them</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0189">I'll risk one</u>
<u n="1041" who="S0192">yeah okay so get rid of that card</u>

<u n="1062" who="S0227">that yeah</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0192">you can put it down and say it's good this is okay or it's bad or you can put I think you can put put it to the bottom of the deck it's your choice</u>

<u n="1069" who="S0227">it it's quite a tough tune isn't it?</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0189"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1071" who="S0227">even I erm <trunc>degr</trunc></u>
<u n="1072" who="S0190"><unclear/> it's</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0192">erm it's gonna take you about an hour to get to grips I think we need to go round like twice before we'll understand it I think <unclear/></u>
<u n="1074" who="S0227">unfortunately there's no dummy run is there?</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0192">yeah this is the dummy run nothing's gonna happen too much at the minute don't worry</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0189"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1078" who="S0192">if you don't want to we can stop <unclear/></u>
<u n="1079" who="S0227">no no</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0190">no go on I'll have a go yeah but I'm just <vocal desc="laugh"/> I don't see the point</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0227" trans="overlap">we'll give it a go</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/> at the minute</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0190">at the minute yeah</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0192">yeah fine</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0190">I don't see what we're trying to do er to achieve</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0227">we're trying to get to Kobol</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0227">I do know that much <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1089" who="S0190">yeah but where's Kobol</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0227">earth</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0190">yeah</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0192">we have to jump</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0227">jump</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0192">here so once we get up here</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0227"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1096" who="S0192">we jump and we go back to the start so we basically have to make this thing go up to the top and back down four times</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0190">right</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0192">and er</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0227">and eight</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0192">and we pull cards here that tells us where we go</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0227">eight</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0192">now we lose if any of these the fuel the food the morale the population if any of these go down to zero we lose so certain cards we pull are gonna say minus two of this or minus one of this</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0190">right</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0192">or something like that we have to bet to stop that from happening the Cylons can attack you as well and these little things here these are like destruction on the ship so you can't use this area if it's got one on it</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="1106" who="S0192">so they're they're trying to attack you as well these things here are little population ships if you turn these for example it's got the sign of population people and the sign of morale so if this got destroyed by this or one of these then we'd lose one of each on this one so it's all about losing these basically</u>
<u n="1107" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1108" who="S0192">everything is trying to kill your population kill your morale kill your food and kill your your fuel</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0189">yeah and er whoever's the Cylon they'll want bad things to happen to the rest of the team</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0189">but not to not get found out</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0192">they don't wanna be obvious yeah</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0192">so you wanna keep it a secret so like now <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s gonna draw his crisis card every round we play you draw one crisis card so</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0189">oh so I got to see what I was about to?</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0192">yeah you can either put it back at the bottom and choose another one or or use that one</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0189">oh okay erm</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0192">you're gonna do that one now you can show us so now you put it down on the table</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0189">yeah okay</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0192">what is it? so there's two symbols on the card usually this little sun means jump so now we've drawn this card this goes up one okay? so we're trying to get up on this thing we've gone up one because there's that sign this sign looks like these little ships here and we don't have any on the board so because we have a basestar and we saw this sign the basestar launches one okay?</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0227">okay</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0192">and that goes on to the board</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0192">they're trying to board <trunc>Ga</trunc>Galactica they're trying to get on board and destroy us</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0192">right if we pass it the president that's you looks at one random loyalty card of anyone</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0227">when you <trunc>w</trunc>when you pass what do you mean by pass it?</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0192">okay so at the top of each thing there's a number thirteen</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0192">and there's the colours that you can use these have different colours</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0192">so we all have to bid together using these cards we all have to bid and put them in in a pile and if we get above thirteen cumulatively we win and we pass if we get below if we fail it then we lose one morale and if we get above nine but we don't fail it nothing happens on this one</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0227">okay</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0192">so we've gotta vote for this so you've gotta have a look at your cards</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0227">cos er I've only got two cards I didn't have</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0227">right okay</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0192"><trunc>w</trunc> at the minute</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0190">so have I</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0227">no cos it's not my game <unclear/></u>
<u n="1142" who="S0192">at the minute we only do we don't have many cards <unclear/></u>
<u n="1143" who="S0227">yeah well I'm struggling <trunc>r</trunc> erm not just the concept but but with my eyes because erm to see this I need these but to read this I can't use these</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1145" who="S0227">so I'm kind of off on off on</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0192">it's not working <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1147" who="S0227">I need bifocals</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0192">you need one just a monocle on one eye <unclear/></u>
<u n="1149" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1150" who="S0189">so we're kinda screwed</u>
<u n="1151" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1152" who="S0189">because like we don't have many cards on play</u>
<u n="1153" who="S0192">no and that was quite a high one to pick if I and it was damaging us if I were you I'd've put that to the bottom</u>
<u n="1154" who="S0189">well I didn't know</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0192">no <vocal desc="laugh"/> but that's fine</u>
<u n="1156" who="S0227">you do now</u>
<u n="1157" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1158" who="S0189">yeah oh no</u>
<u n="1159" who="S0192">it's happened</u>
<u n="1160" who="S0189">well</u>
<u n="1161" who="S0192">we can lose it and we just minus one morale that's all</u>
<u n="1162" who="S0189">er can we <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="1163" who="S0192">so now everyone looks at their cards and says how much you can help in this bid you can't be explicit but you can say I can help a bit or I can help a lot and you could be lying</u>
<u n="1164" who="S0227"><trunc>w</trunc> talking of dummy I <trunc>mea</trunc></u>
<u n="1165" who="S0192">you could put in a negative card something that goes against it</u>
<u n="1166" who="S0189">can we only give one card each?</u>
<u n="1167" who="S0192">no you can give as many cards as you want</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0189">right so if I had thirteen then I could put them all down</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0192">yes however there is a destiny deck so there will always be two random cards in it you don't know what those cards are so we need to try and be a bit higher than thirteen cos these could be two negative cards</u>
<u n="1170" who="S0190">so we're all we're doing is looking to the at the numbers on the corner of the cards?</u>
<u n="1171" who="S0227">the the the <trunc>m</trunc></u>
<u n="1172" who="S0192">yeah just the numbers on the corner</u>
<u n="1173" who="S0227" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="1174" who="S0190">it doesn't matter what they say they just <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="1175" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="1176" who="S0227" trans="overlap">so it doesn't matter if it's?</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0192">provided it's the right colours which on this one is yellow and green so it's quite restricted it doesn't do three of the colours</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0227">oh <trunc>s</trunc> oh right so I can do one of my cards</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0192">if you haven't got that colour the</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0227">or it's</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0192">or or if you're a Cylon you could put a card of a different colour down</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0192">and you want them to lose so you're doing that but you have to be careful because if you put too many they'll know that somebody is sabotaging the bet</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0227"><trunc>tho</trunc>those other colours do they? what do they do? do they?</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0189"><trunc>d</trunc> they're negative</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0227">are they negative?</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0192">they're negative against it yeah</u>
<u n="1190" who="S0227">right so if it was say</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0192">so I've pulled two random cards now they could</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0227">so okay</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0192">let's play this one out so we see what's happening here we</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0227">yeah that's why we er have a complete dumminy dummy run</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0192">so actually this is good for us</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0192">I pulled two random cards and they're both in favour and one is a five and one is a three so we're already at power eight</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0227" trans="overlap">that's eight yes</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0192">so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> what actually you'll contribute last cos it's your go first so <unclear/></u>

<u n="1470" who="S0190">right</u>
<u n="1471" who="S0192">so this one here the raiders if you see a sign that looks like these ships</u>
<u n="1472" who="S0190">yeah</u>
<u n="1473" who="S0192">that means that these get activated and they move</u>
<u n="1474" who="S0190">right</u>
<u n="1475" who="S0192">if you see this sign that means that we go up one on the jump we want that</u>
<u n="1476" who="S0190">right yeah</u>
<u n="1477" who="S0192">but we don't want that</u>
<u n="1478" who="S0190">erm so</u>
<u n="1479" who="S0192">basically</u>
<u n="1480" who="S0190">right so</u>
<u n="1481" who="S0227">so if you were a Cylon you'd go for that one rather than that one <unclear/></u>
<u n="1482" who="S0190">you don't choose they both happen</u>
<u n="1483" who="S0227">oh they both happen? <unclear/></u>
<u n="1484" who="S0192">some of them you can see only there's only one</u>
<u n="1485" who="S0227">oh right okay</u>
<u n="1486" who="S0192">this one doesn't have the jump</u>
<u n="1487" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1488" who="S0192">so</u>
<u n="1489" who="S0190">so we'll go with the jump cos that's good isn't it?</u>
<u n="1490" who="S0192">yeah so jumping is good and this one is</u>
<u n="1491" who="S0190">yeah</u>
<u n="1492" who="S0192">just saying admiral chooses so basically you're the admiral so she's gonna give you this card and say you choose what do we do?</u>
<u n="1493" who="S0190">okay</u>
<u n="1494" who="S0192"><unclear/> so what's the choice?</u>
<u n="1495" who="S0227">oh I've got er I've got er the only choice I've got is to move er</u>
<u n="1496" who="S0192">do you want me to read it out?</u>
<u n="1497" who="S0227">er yes</u>
<u n="1498" who="S0192">okay admiral chooses do you wanna read it out <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>? get another voice on here</u>
<u n="1499" who="S0189"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1500" who="S0227">oh the <trunc>ga</trunc> oh you're still oh er you're recording?</u>
<u n="1501" who="S0190">oh you're not recording this?</u>
<u n="1502" who="S0189">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1503" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1504" who="S0227"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1505" who="S0189">it's perfect perfect <unclear/> talk</u>
<u n="1506" who="S0190"><unclear/> not to <unclear/></u>
<u n="1507" who="S0227"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1508" who="S0189">right here we go admiral chooses minus one to morale and the current player is sent to sickbay</u>
<u n="1509" who="S0192">so that'd be <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="1510" who="S0189">or minus one fuel and destroy one raptor</u>
<u n="1511" who="S0192">okay so either minus one morale and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> goes to sickbay</u>
<u n="1512" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1513" who="S0192">or minus one fuel and destroy a raptor</u>
<u n="1514" who="S0227">no I'll put her in sickbay</u>
<u n="1515" who="S0192">are you sure you wanna do that?</u>
<u n="1516" who="S0227">er <trunc>w</trunc>well er we're losing <trunc>res</trunc> by putting her in there she's having a rest we're losing resources with the alternative are are we not?</u>
<u n="1517" who="S0192">you lose resources both ways you <trunc>ei</trunc> you always lose either one morale and send her to sickbay or lose one fuel and destroy a raptor so you're losing one of something</u>
<u n="1518" who="S0227">okay let's go for the lesser of two evils er</u>
<u n="1519" who="S0192">if <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> goes to sickbay then when it's her turn again she can only draw one card at the beginning you cannot skill up with all your cards you can only get one skill card so being in the sickbay or the Brig is bad you don't wanna be there <unclear/></u>
<u n="1520" who="S0227">okay so perhaps it's better to destroy a raptor</u>
<u n="1521" who="S0192">and a fuel</u>
<u n="1522" who="S0227">and a fuel</u>
<u n="1523" who="S0192">cool raptor <trunc>d</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> did it definitely say fuel on there?</u>
<u n="1524" who="S0227">erm <trunc>ro</trunc> de de de de <unclear/></u>
<u n="1525" who="S0189">yeah one fuel</u>
<u n="1526" who="S0192">cool and one raptor</u>
<u n="1527" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah one fuel and one and one raptor</u>
<u n="1528" who="S0189">yeah there's also a jump and er a <unclear>Cylon</unclear></u>
<u n="1529" who="S0192">right so we go up one here and also the Cylons attack so basically when we saw that these activate these things go clockwise around the board these things</u>
<u n="1530" who="S0227">oh that's just another thing to remember <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1531" who="S0192">yeah they go this way round the board</u>
<u n="1532" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1533" who="S0192">and they're trying to destroy our ships</u>
<u n="1534" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1535" who="S0192">or these things okay?</u>
<u n="1536" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1537" who="S0192">these things go either way round the board depending on which way is closer to this bit</u>
<u n="1538" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1539" who="S0192">so this one is clearly closer this way so it's just</u>
<u n="1540" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1541" who="S0192">gonna go this way</u>
<u n="1542" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1543" who="S0192">and try <unclear>and get in</unclear> so now these have activated these three move up one</u>
<u n="1544" who="S0189">oh no</u>
<u n="1545" who="S0192">these lot move up one</u>
<u n="1546" who="S0190">mm</u>
<u n="1547" who="S0192">and these lot move up one okay?</u>
<u n="1548" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1549" who="S0192">so next time if they activate they're gonna try attacking <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and these ships so</u>
<u n="1550" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1551" who="S0189">what happens if I get attacked while I'm in that ship?</u>
<u n="1552" who="S0192">you can be destroyed and you go to the sickbay</u>
<u n="1553" who="S0189">oh right</u>
<u n="1554" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1555" who="S0192">but you can defend yourself also and we can give cards to help you</u>

<u n="1564" who="S0227">mm oh I've got</u>
<u n="1565" who="S0192">actually I have erm my negative is that I can only have eight in my hand</u>
<u n="1566" who="S0227">oh right</u>
<u n="1567" who="S0192">not ten</u>

<u n="1578" who="S0227">is it destroyed?</u>
<u n="1579" who="S0192">this basestar's gone it already had two and I gave it another one</u>
<u n="1580" who="S0227">right and it's three to destroy it yeah so that's that's</u>
<u n="1581" who="S0192" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah so we've got got rid of that one so it's my go I'm now gonna draw a crisis card okay power of nine colours purple and red</u>
<u n="1582" who="S0227">okay</u>
<u n="1583" who="S0192">now that's difficult <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s the only one with reds</u>
<u n="1584" who="S0227">yes</u>

<u n="1742" who="S0227">er it's making more sense I don't know totally what I'm doing but</u>
<u n="1743" who="S0189"><unclear>we're getting there</unclear> I think we should take the food loss</u>
<u n="1744" who="S0190">how many <trunc>f</trunc> how much food have we can we afford to lose?</u>
<u n="1745" who="S0192">well we're at seven if we get down to zero we we're bad</u>
<u n="1746" who="S0227">we're</u>
<u n="1747" who="S0192">population we have the most of but every time we jump these cards pretty much always minus population</u>
<u n="1748" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1749" who="S0192">so you kinda like lose ships as you</u>
<u n="1750" who="S0190">can we have a choice? can I tell you would it?</u>
<u n="1751" who="S0192">yeah you can tell us the choice</u>
<u n="1752" who="S0190">er it you've got we've either got to do minus one food or I've got to lose two of my skill cards and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s got to lose three of his</u>
<u n="1753" who="S0192">and that's all that happens? we don't lose any food or anything?</u>
<u n="1754" who="S0190">yeah the choice</u>
<u n="1755" who="S0192"><trunc>c</trunc> do you have the <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="1756" who="S0189"><unclear>yeah it's</unclear></u>
<u n="1757" who="S0192">do you have the skill cards to get rid of?</u>
<u n="1758" who="S0189">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="1759" who="S0192">can you get rid of two and you get rid of three?</u>
<u n="1760" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="1761" who="S0192">yeah? do that then maybe that's better than losing one of these cos we get the skill cards again we never get that back again</u>
<u n="1762" who="S0227">unless she's a Cylon and we're just we <trunc>sh</trunc></u>
<u n="1763" who="S0192">and then I'm telling you</u>
<u n="1764" who="S0227"><vocal desc="laugh"/> we shouldn't be listening to this at all <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1765" who="S0192">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> who is the Cylon? is anyone the Cylon?</u>
<u n="1766" who="S0190">so I wanna keep the highest score don't I?</u>
<u n="1767" who="S0192">yes</u>
<u n="1768" who="S0190">yeah?</u>
<u n="1769" who="S0192">yeah keep the highest scores</u>
<u n="1770" who="S0190">so I lose two</u>
<u n="1771" who="S0227">is there a possibility that none of us are Cylons?</u>
<u n="1772" who="S0192">there is a possibility that nobody is a Cylon</u>
<u n="1773" who="S0227"><trunc>i</trunc>is it more an interesting possibility if we were all the Cylons?</u>
<u n="1774" who="S0192"><trunc>c</trunc> there can only be one at this point in the game</u>
<u n="1775" who="S0227">oh right</u>
<u n="1776" who="S0192">so at this point now you know I said we need to jump and we need to get a score of eight</u>
<u n="1777" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1778" who="S0192">when we get to a score of four we go into a sleeper phase where somebody wakes up from being a Cylon so we get dealt another loyalty card and that means that one of us is definitely a Cylon and if one of if any one of these are in the red when we get to that phase if this is in the red any one of them then there's only one Cylon in this game because we're already losing so</u>
<u n="1779" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1780" who="S0192">they don't wanna make it too difficult but if we get to four out of eight and we're still in the blue somebody else will also be a Cylon there will be two and it'll be two on two so it depends where we are on this tactically you can actually try and make this just get into the red just when that happens so that you don't get a second Cylon</u>
<u n="1781" who="S0227"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1782" who="S0192">but that's getting a bit complicated you got rid of a red one okay</u>
<u n="1783" who="S0227">right so it's my go own isn't it?</u>
<u n="1784" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="1785" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1786" who="S0227">I pick up two greens and erm oh <unclear>so it gets</unclear> two green er three greens and two purples</u>
<u n="1787" who="S0192">three greens and two purples there you go</u>
<u n="1788" who="S0190">so do we get this every time? each round?</u>
<u n="1789" who="S0192">every time yeah</u>
<u n="1790" who="S0190">every round okay</u>
<u n="1791" who="S0192">so you can get rid of them there's <unclear/></u>
<u n="1792" who="S0227">well that's not a brilliant hand</u>
<u n="1793" who="S0192">yeah I've got a lot of low cards</u>
<u n="1794" who="S0189">me too</u>
<u n="1795" who="S0192">we're actually quite heavily under attack at the moment</u>
<u n="1796" who="S0227">right shall I take a what's it's called card now?</u>
<u n="1797" who="S0192">you haven't moved yet</u>
<u n="1798" who="S0227">oh oh of course I've gotta move before I take my</u>
<u n="1799" who="S0192">now there's a very sneaky one here called FTL control you can actually jump us prematurely if you want to</u>
<u n="1800" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1801" who="S0192">you can go to this location and jump us</u>
<u n="1802" who="S0227">FTL? faster than light?</u>
<u n="1803" who="S0192">yeah so you can jump us prematurely once we're out of the red and we're in the blue which we're in now</u>
<u n="1804" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1805" who="S0192">you can jump early</u>
<u n="1806" who="S0227">yeah I think</u>
<u n="1807" who="S0192">but when you jump you roll a dice if you lose you minus three population if you jump at this point</u>
<u n="1808" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1809" who="S0192">if you lose here you minus one population if you jump at this point</u>
<u n="1810" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1811" who="S0192">so jumping early bears a risk on your population</u>
<u n="1812" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1813" who="S0192">but you can do it</u>
<u n="1814" who="S0227">well look</u>
<u n="1815" who="S0189">I think it'd be worth it</u>
<u n="1816" who="S0227">looking at er</u>
<u n="1817" who="S0192">do you think it's worth it?</u>
<u n="1818" who="S0227">well looking at it tactically erm we've got a load we could clear all this all this space</u>
<u n="1819" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1820" who="S0227">of</u>
<u n="1821" who="S0192">get everything off the board</u>
<u n="1822" who="S0227">death stars and that but I've gotta get a a die that is lower than three?</u>
<u n="1823" who="S0192">lower than a <trunc>s</trunc> er you gotta get a seven or an eight to be okay</u>
<u n="1824" who="S0227">seven or? what? on the dice? oh course it go oh course it's it's not it's not cuboid is it yeah</u>
<u n="1825" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="1826" who="S0227">that's er chances of that are gonna be</u>
<u n="1827" who="S0189"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1828" who="S0227">is eight</u>
<u n="1829" who="S0192">hang on let me just have a quick look it goes up to eight</u>
<u n="1830" who="S0227">erm</u>
<u n="1831" who="S0192">FTL jump the current player rolls the die and if a six or lower is rolled then you lose the population so you need a seven or an eight to be okay</u>
<u n="1832" who="S0227">right so basically</u>
<u n="1833" who="S0192">so can anyone help with dad's die roll in any way? again I think it's purple I think it's tactics</u>
<u n="1834" who="S0189"><unclear>look</unclear></u>
<u n="1835" who="S0192">are you gonna jump early? or are you gonna do a different move?</u>
<u n="1836" who="S0227">oh I've got a <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="1837" who="S0189">think it's worth it</u>
<u n="1838" who="S0227">I've got a seventy-six percent chance of not of not getting it</u>
<u n="1839" who="S0189"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah but we still jump we just lose some population</u>
<u n="1840" who="S0190">can I use this one?</u>
<u n="1841" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1842" who="S0190">can <trunc>w</trunc>well what about this one then?</u>
<u n="1843" who="S0192">let's have a look <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> so this one says play after strength is totalled okay so this one is the same one <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had before that's a skill check so whereas we had the card that says oh that one doesn't have one this one has a power of six let's say we'd skilled up we totalled it up and we only got four but this card allows you to reduce this power by two</u>
<u n="1844" who="S0190">oh right</u>
<u n="1845" who="S0192">so</u>
<u n="1846" who="S0190">so it doesn't reduce what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s got to get on that one?</u>
<u n="1847" who="S0192">doesn't reduce the roll no</u>
<u n="1848" who="S0227">right okay right</u>
<u n="1849" who="S0192">the the I think the one we're looking for is a purple one dad might have it in your purple cards?</u>
<u n="1850" who="S0227">and what's the purple one gonna say?</u>
<u n="1851" who="S0192">do you have one that say like reduce the die roll by two or something?</u>
<u n="1852" who="S0227">erm <unclear>don't think it's that one</unclear></u>
<u n="1853" who="S0192">let's have a look see if there's any in here that say it so I can show you</u>
<u n="1854" who="S0189">strategic planning maybe?</u>
<u n="1855" who="S0227">yes it's the purple's strategic planning but erm erm</u>
<u n="1856" who="S0192">ah here this one says play before any die roll to add two to the result but actually you do wanna add two to the result</u>
<u n="1857" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1858" who="S0192">cos you could get a four and then it gives you six do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="1859" who="S0227">so er could I use my two if I got a six would that give me eight?</u>
<u n="1860" who="S0192">yeah have you got one that says that?</u>
<u n="1861" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1862" who="S0192">yeah? so you add that in now and you gotta play it before the die roll not after</u>
<u n="1863" who="S0227">oh right oh I see right how about if I've got two of them?</u>
<u n="1864" who="S0192">you can only use one per round</u>
<u n="1865" who="S0227">damn it okay so I'm gonna use one of those</u>
<u n="1866" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="1867" who="S0227">so if I get er so now</u>
<u n="1868" who="S0192">so now you've bettered your chances</u>
<u n="1869" who="S0227">I've so I've gotta get six or higher</u>
<u n="1870" who="S0192">you've gotta get five or higher</u>
<u n="1871" who="S0227">five or higher</u>
<u n="1872" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1873" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1874" who="S0189"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1875" who="S0192">you can do it</u>
<u n="1876" who="S0189">yes that'll do</u>
<u n="1877" who="S0192">score you didn't even need it nice</u>
<u n="1878" who="S0227">it was better to <trunc>ha</trunc> to have had it and</u>
<u n="1879" who="S0192">so we jump</u>
<u n="1880" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1881" who="S0192">and we didn't lose any population so this goes back to zero</u>
<u n="1882" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1883" who="S0192">and all these things come off</u>
<u n="1884" who="S0227">come off yeah</u>
<u n="1885" who="S0192">including our own ships</u>
<u n="1886" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1887" who="S0192">you can help</u>
<u n="1888" who="S0227">where do these go?</u>
<u n="1889" who="S0192">just back where they belong <unclear/> there</u>
<u n="1890" who="S0227">where did that go? I <trunc>d</trunc> yeah I didn't know where <unclear/></u>
<u n="1891" who="S0189"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1892" who="S0227">so that's actually been quite helpful</u>
<u n="1893" who="S0192">yeah you've cleared the board</u>
<u n="1894" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1895" who="S0192">so we're back to square one</u>
<u n="1896" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1897" who="S0192">we're not in trouble any more</u>
<u n="1898" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="1899" who="S0192">although I added an I <vocal desc="laugh"/> we added a rule to the game where every time we jump a basestar follows us that's our own rule</u>
<u n="1900" who="S0227">okay</u>
<u n="1901" who="S0192">we can choose whether or not to play that because sometimes when you jump and you clear the board it can take ages before you get a card that brings Cylons back on <unclear>on the thing</unclear></u>
<u n="1902" who="S0227">okay yeah for a bit of spice</u>
<u n="1903" who="S0192">and it can be a bit boring so <unclear>just</unclear> kinda like</u>

<u n="1912" who="S0227">and everyone gets to see this do they not?</u>
<u n="1913" who="S0192">yes</u>
<u n="1914" who="S0227">right erm</u>

<u n="1930" who="S0192">well you <trunc>s</trunc> yeah no it'll give us to basestars so we set this up again <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="2061" who="S0190">right so oh yes erm</u>
<u n="2062" who="S0192">oh we jumped earlier sorry didn't do this when we jump the <trunc>presid</trunc> the admiral gets two of these cards</u>
<u n="2063" who="S0190">oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="2064" who="S0192">and gets to have a look at them and decide which one we choose</u>
<u n="2065" who="S0227" trans="overlap">only me?</u>
<u n="2066" who="S0192">so remember we're trying to get to a power of eight so you need to choose either one that takes us far but is damaging or one that doesn't take us so far and is less damaging <pause dur="long"/> what do you think? I think he's struggling to read it</u>
<u n="2067" who="S0227">no I can read it it's just erm er you were saying about the <trunc>nu</trunc>numerical order on the erm is the higher the numerical order the better? or lower?</u>
<u n="2068" who="S0192">so let's have a look at these ones together normally you'd look on your own one's got a three and one's got a one</u>
<u n="2069" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="2070" who="S0192">we wanna get further so we want the three but the three has a negative lose three fuel</u>
<u n="2071" who="S0227">yes the <trunc>fu</trunc>fuel yes exactly</u>
<u n="2072" who="S0192">which is pretty <trunc>s</trunc> pretty bad erm</u>
<u n="2073" who="S0227">but that gets us three up here doesn't it?'</u>
<u n="2074" who="S0192">yeah but we need to get to eight and another jump</u>
<u n="2075" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="2076" who="S0192">and that would take er nearly half of our fuel away the other one</u>
<u n="2077" who="S0227">how much fuel does it take away?</u>
<u n="2078" who="S0192">three</u>
<u n="2079" who="S0227">oh right well yeah that's yes</u>
<u n="2080" who="S0192"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="2081" who="S0227">so we're gonna have to go for the er</u>
<u n="2082" who="S0192">the other one is a one and it says lose one fuel</u>
<u n="2083" who="S0227">and I've gotta roll a dice</u>
<u n="2084" who="S0192">and then you can roll a die and maybe gain two fuel</u>
<u n="2085" who="S0227">yes that</u>
<u n="2086" who="S0192">so which one do you wanna choose?</u>
<u n="2087" who="S0227">it's got to be the latter er hasn't it?</u>
<u n="2088" who="S0192">okay so this one we didn't do</u>
<u n="2089" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="2090" who="S0192">we've now jumped to a stage of one so one of eight isn't that didn't jump us very far at all</u>
<u n="2091" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="2092" who="S0192">erm so now you roll a die</u>
<u n="2093" who="S0227">and do we lose a raptor? <trunc>o</trunc></u>
<u n="2094" who="S0192">erm we may may risk a raptor to roll a die</u>
<u n="2095" who="S0227">right and what?</u>
<u n="2096" who="S0192">if three or higher gain two fuel</u>
<u n="2097" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="2098" who="S0192">otherwise if it's one or two we destroy the raptor</u>
<u n="2099" who="S0227">right so I've gotta get higher than three</u>
<u n="2100" who="S0192">yeah well three or higher nice so we actually gain two fuel so that helped us so we go up to nine</u>
<u n="2101" who="S0227">right okay</u>
<u n="2102" who="S0192">cool</u>
<u n="2103" who="S0190">now what do I do with these two cards?</u>

<u n="2202" who="S0190">is that because I'm the only woman?</u>
<u n="2203" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2204" who="S0189">no <vocal desc="laugh"/> maybe</u>

<u n="2206" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2207" who="S0190">and then you can't</u>
<u n="2208" who="S0192">so these two actually move round and that's terrible luck cos once these get in we're screwed</u>
<u n="2209" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="2210" who="S0192">we go up one other jump track and now we bet so this is face down so we don't know so if you're a Cylon now you wanna try and sabotage this but chances are <unclear>we'll completely miss it</unclear></u>
<u n="2211" who="S0227" trans="overlap">right is this the <trunc>f</trunc> we're trying to get fourteen aren't we?</u>
<u n="2212" who="S0192">twelve yeah</u>
<u n="2213" who="S0227">twelve?</u>
<u n="2214" who="S0190">so is it to my advantage to give it to you or not? if you're if you're going to erm</u>
<u n="2215" who="S0192">are you a Cylon then?</u>
<u n="2216" who="S0190">I'm not gonna <unclear>tell you what I am am I</unclear>?</u>
<u n="2217" who="S0227">if you're if you're a <trunc>Cy</trunc>if you're a Cylon you don't although you've got the cards you don't have to play them do you?</u>
<u n="2218" who="S0192">no you don't have to play them</u>
<u n="2219" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="2220" who="S0192">you could put in the colours that negate it</u>

<u n="2222" who="S0192">you could put in red and and blue and whatever</u>
<u n="2223" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="2224" who="S0192">so it goes against it</u>
<u n="2225" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="2226" who="S0192">however if we put these cards out turn them and there's like five negative cards in there we know that somebody's definitely <trunc>sabota</trunc> it's not just this random chance cards</u>
<u n="2227" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="2228" who="S0192">somebody's cos er I just put two random ones in</u>
<u n="2229" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="2230" who="S0192">these could be for or against us</u>
<u n="2231" who="S0227">okay</u>

<u n="2812" who="S0190">right</u>
<u n="2813" who="S0192">if we fail it we didn't make twelve then we minus a fuel and destroy a raptor</u>
<u n="2814" who="S0190">mm</u>
<u n="2815" who="S0192">or instead of trying to do the skills check</u>
<u n="2816" who="S0190">yeah</u>
<u n="2817" who="S0192">you can just roll a die and if it's four or lower we minus a fuel</u>
<u n="2818" who="S0190">so there's bad <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> but <unclear/></u>
<u n="2819" who="S0192">so you've got like this one is fifty-fifty</u>

<u n="2826" who="S0190">happens that's better isn't it?</u>
<u n="2827" who="S0192">if we get seven plus the current player discards two skill cards and if we fail it we lose a morale normally this card would be better</u>
<u n="2828" who="S0190">right</u>
<u n="2829" who="S0192">however this card has a plus of fuel and you don't very often get plus something</u>
<u n="2830" who="S0190">right okay</u>
<u n="2831" who="S0192">so it's worth trying to do that</u>
<u n="2832" who="S0190">right</u>

<u n="2853" who="S0227">mm</u>

<u n="2936" who="S0227">well we're we're in the right position to jump aren't we?</u>
<u n="2937" who="S0192">we'll risk three population but I mean we jumped last time and nothing happened so</u>
<u n="2938" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="2939" who="S0192">shall we risk it again?</u>
<u n="2940" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="2941" who="S0192">does anyone have something to add? minus?</u>
<u n="2942" who="S0189"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2943" who="S0192">is there any way of doing that?</u>
<u n="2944" who="S0227">in what? in</u>
<u n="2945" who="S0189">add to the roll</u>
<u n="2946" who="S0192">yeah we don't wanna we do wanna add to the roll does anyone have one that adds to the roll? it's a purple one I think <unclear/></u>
<u n="2947" who="S0189">could we add a a negative to a roll?</u>
<u n="2948" who="S0190">when am I supposed to use these cards?</u>
<u n="2949" who="S0192">erm let's have a look at what they are</u>
<u n="2950" who="S0190">hang on hang on hang on</u>
<u n="2951" who="S0192">not the loyalty card yeah</u>
<u n="2952" who="S0227">I've got action risk one raptor to roll a die if three or higher <unclear/></u>
<u n="2953" who="S0189">no it's not that one</u>
<u n="2954" who="S0227">that's not it? it's not that one either</u>
<u n="2955" who="S0192">so this one allows you to draw two politics cards er whenever you use it and then you give it to somebody and then so basically this one so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s got a card that says she can draw two of these cards and give this to someone whoever she gives this to when we jump the admiral doesn't choose this whoever she gave this to chooses this</u>
<u n="2956" who="S0189">mm so if</u>
<u n="2957" who="S0192">er</u>
<u n="2958" who="S0189">if we don't trust the admiral</u>
<u n="2959" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2960" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="2961" who="S0192">then we can give this so if you don't trust the admiral if you think that he's a Cylon and when we jump he's gonna choose where we go he's already given us a low one last time one</u>
<u n="2962" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="2963" who="S0192">not three</u>
<u n="2964" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="2965" who="S0192">then you could give this card to say me and then I get to choose these cards next time</u>
<u n="2966" who="S0190">mm</u>
<u n="2967" who="S0192">this one you draw two politics cards keep this card in play while this player is not the president other players may not be chosen with the administration location so it's basically saying if you give this to me while I'm not the president we cannot elect a new president here with this thing so it's just saying that that doesn't work basically and the last one just as it says destroy <trunc>thr</trunc> that one's pretty good this one <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> says destroy three raiders that's three of these</u>
<u n="2968" who="S0190"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2969" who="S0192">one heavy raider or one centurion</u>
<u n="2970" who="S0227">but you wouldn't wanna do that if you were a Cylon <unclear/></u>
<u n="2971" who="S0192">then roll a die so you could help us destroy some of this stuff</u>
<u n="2972" who="S0189">but we're gonna jump</u>
<u n="2973" who="S0190">but when do I use them?</u>
<u n="2974" who="S0192"><trunc>w</trunc> for your action so you move and then you chose an action</u>
<u n="2975" who="S0190">right</u>
<u n="2976" who="S0192">and that's an option</u>
<u n="2977" who="S0227"><trunc>l</trunc>like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said if if we're gonna jump and be successful that would be an irrelevance wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="2978" who="S0192">no yeah so I'm gonna roll I need a seven or an eight to be okay ah does anyone have anything to add to the die roll?</u>
<u n="2979" who="S0227">what's that? no</u>
<u n="2980" who="S0192">six no so we minus three population</u>
<u n="2981" who="S0189">oh</u>
<u n="2982" who="S0227">and we don't jump</u>
<u n="2983" who="S0192"><unclear/> we do jump</u>
<u n="2984" who="S0227">oh we do yeah</u>
<u n="2985" who="S0192">but with minus three population so clear the board</u>
<u n="2986" who="S0227">board <unclear/> and we leave one of these on are we leaving it? where are we putting it?</u>
<u n="2987" who="S0192">yeah we leave it <unclear>at the front of the ship</unclear> <unclear/></u>
