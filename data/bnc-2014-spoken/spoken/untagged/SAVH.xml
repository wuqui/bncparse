<u n="2" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/> erm</u>
<u n="3" who="S0670">she had very <unclear/> lips</u>
<u n="4" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="5" who="S0670">full bodied as well</u>
<u n="6" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/> well I <unclear/></u>
<u n="7" who="S0670" trans="overlap">so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> how's your sex life?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0671">well <vocal desc="laugh"/> what what I was going to ask is erm <trunc>s</trunc> er the Deal or No Deal question again</u>
<u n="9" who="S0670">yeah okay</u>
<u n="10" who="S0671">at what point would you erm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0670">are we talking Weakest Link</u>
<u n="12" who="S0671" trans="overlap">in your</u>
<u n="13" who="S0670">or Deal or No Deal?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0671">and your well I don't I don't really</u>
<u n="15" who="S0670" trans="overlap">or Who Wants to be a Millionaire?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="17" who="S0670">because</u>
<u n="18" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/> well I don't know I don't know er Weakest Link the concept of Weakest Link I just know that you</u>
<u n="19" who="S0670">you answer questions every time an answer is correct it moves up er in the you know amount of money you can win but if anyone gets a question wrong it all goes back to zero and before a question is asked</u>
<u n="20" who="S0671">so when you</u>
<u n="21" who="S0670" trans="overlap">you can say bank so it's technically working as a team but it's also very individual</u>
<u n="22" who="S0671">like cricket?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0670">no more individual than that as in basically the benefit</u>
<u n="24" who="S0671" trans="overlap">Hunger Hunger Games</u>
<u n="25" who="S0670">of working as as <trunc>t</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0671" trans="overlap">The Hunger Games?</u>
<u n="27" who="S0670">yes</u>
<u n="28" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0670"><trunc>esse</trunc>essentially it is like you're working together in order for it to be better for you</u>
<u n="30" who="S0671">right yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0670" trans="overlap">erm and you basically</u>
<u n="32" who="S0671" trans="overlap">so communism?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0670">it's like a very capitalist version of communism</u>
<u n="34" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="35" who="S0670">yeah erm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0671">well I guess then you wouldn't have much difficulty</u>
<u n="37" who="S0670" trans="overlap">and basically before so you but the main thing is just you answer a question and you want to get it right because if you get it wrong not only does it take the prize money back down to zero for that round</u>
<u n="38" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="39" who="S0670">but also at the end end of every round everyone votes as to who gets knocked out that round</u>
<u n="40" who="S0671">oh so surely you just</u>
<u n="41" who="S0670">so it's a cross between picking</u>
<u n="42" who="S0671"><unclear/></u>
<u n="43" who="S0670" trans="overlap">oh that person got the most answers wrong</u>
<u n="44" who="S0671" trans="overlap">people who are going to be better than you you want no</u>
<u n="45" who="S0670">no no that's the thing is that most people at the beginning vote for the people that get it wrong but beyond that cos you <trunc>wa</trunc> you want people to get it right</u>
<u n="46" who="S0671" trans="overlap">oh my goodness it's</u>
<u n="47" who="S0670">in order to get you know the money up</u>
<u n="48" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0670">cos if you just had people getting it wrong then you would never do well you'd never get the money</u>
<u n="50" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0670">and then towards the end then it gets tactical and like I think that person might</u>
<u n="52" who="S0671" trans="overlap">oh my goodness</u>
<u n="53" who="S0670">you know try and oust me</u>
<u n="54" who="S0671" trans="overlap">but</u>
<u n="55" who="S0670">next time so I'll vote for them and hope that other people do as well and then of course when you vote for someone else you're erm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0671">you're like and if they don't go out</u>
<u n="57" who="S0670" trans="overlap">if if they don't if they don't go out then regardless of your performance they're gonna be like oh but they voted for me I don't like them so you're gonna vote for them to get out it gets weirdly personal and spiteful and stuff</u>
<u n="58" who="S0671">whereas Deal or No Deal</u>
<u n="59" who="S0670">and not only</u>
<u n="60" who="S0671" trans="overlap">is just harmless fun</u>
<u n="61" who="S0670" trans="overlap">not only is it is it just like oh if you've got the question wrong I'll vote for you because before you ask before the question is asked a person can say bank and if they say bank then</u>
<u n="62" who="S0671" trans="overlap">they get all the money?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0670">no then all of the money gets saved so let's say five questions in a row were answered correctly as they went round</u>
<u n="64" who="S0671">so you get say five hundred <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="65" who="S0670"><trunc>s</trunc> let let's say erm</u>
<u n="66" who="S0671" trans="overlap">but is it is it</u>
<u n="67" who="S0670" trans="overlap">five grand</u>
<u n="68" who="S0671" trans="overlap">exponential?</u>
<u n="69" who="S0670">at that stage it</u>
<u n="70" who="S0671" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="71" who="S0670" trans="overlap">it does get exponential let's say it's five grand erm and</u>
<u n="72" who="S0671" trans="overlap">to share between your</u>
<u n="73" who="S0670" trans="overlap">a person a person says bank</u>
<u n="74" who="S0671">okay yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0670">then that five grand is saved so that they have five grand that round regardless</u>
<u n="76" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0670">but then it goes back down to zero for that question</u>
<u n="78" who="S0671">but that question could be really easy</u>
<u n="79" who="S0670">yeah in which case if it is easy people are like oh you shouldn't have said bank and then you know we could have gone up from five grand to you know ten grand</u>
<u n="80" who="S0671">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0670">so it's tactically banking because obviously if you don't say banking and you're high up and you get it wrong then it goes back to zero but if you say bank too early then you're gonna look like an idiot because you could have gone higher</u>
<u n="82" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0670">erm and then basically the person at the end who when they get to the last two then they have a sudden death so whoever gets the question wrong first loses and the other person gets the prize money</u>
<u n="84" who="S0671">so the chances of you actually winning this game are pretty slim?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0670">oh very slim like it's not it's not even about it's not a hundred percent about your ability erm in quids kind of cos you can be really good and someone might tactically be like I don't want them in the game any more because they're gonna cause problems for me so they'll try and vote you out</u>
<u n="86" who="S0671">goodness</u>
<u n="87" who="S0670">yeah it was vicious and Anne Robinson</u>
<u n="88" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="89" who="S0670"><unclear>oh my god</unclear> that woman</u>
<u n="90" who="S0671" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0670">was absolutely vicious</u>
<u n="92" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="93" who="S0670">like she was just so brutal for no reason it would be like so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="95" who="S0670">you're a</u>

<u n="102" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/> that's so funny</u>
<u n="103" who="S0670">and you'd be like why are you doing this? so that's</u>
<u n="104" who="S0671" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="105" who="S0670">not exactly a very specialist field now is it Chris? and Chris is just there like like what? why? Anne why are you doing this?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="107" who="S0670">do you get some kind of kick out of this? and the producers every time like Anne can you please you know tone it down?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="114" who="S0671">she's basically Richard the third isn't she?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0670">she is she is a more malevolent Richard the third I'd say</u>
<u n="116" who="S0671" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> more <trunc>malev</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0670">and that wink every time she was like you are the weakest link goodbye and then wink and it was just <trunc>su</trunc> you could feel</u>

<u n="122" who="S0671" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="123" who="S0670">I don't know how she did it but it managed to even as a viewer like suck the soul out of you</u>

<u n="154" who="S0671">would you do it by gut instinct or by er working like by probability?</u>
<u n="155" who="S0670"><vocal desc="sigh"/> well the thing is that gut instinct is just intrinsically gonna be wrong more times ironically out of probability it will be <vocal desc="laugh"/> but</u>
<u n="156" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="157" who="S0670">if you win by probability it's kind of a hollow win and it's like because it's hugely unlikely that you'd win big big by probability</u>
<u n="158" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="159" who="S0670">if you're working entirely mathematically you'd probably end up with like a five ten grand kind of prize you'd get some money and it's good money but there would come a point halfway through the show where everyone would be like yeah yeah no he's doing really well and you'd be like yeah I'll take the ten grand thank you bye <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0671">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0670" trans="overlap">everyone'll be like what? no go for the big prize you can still have the big prize and you're like statistically no</u>
<u n="162" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="163" who="S0670">gonna stick with this but if you and if but there again yeah if you go with the gut instinct and you win then that's just the most incredible feeling it's just</u>
<u n="164" who="S0671">it's like squaring a last minute goal in FIFA</u>
<u n="165" who="S0670">it's a little too soon mate</u>
<u n="166" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="364" who="S0671">or it's really shunned and he's found it from some role model and he's got it whereas his basketball is what his family wanted him to <pause dur="short"/> do so it's all these passions aren't things that are like <pause dur="short"/> great things that we should be championing they're just other types of norms</u>
<u n="365" who="S0670">I think textually there is not a lot of evidence for that</u>

<u n="374" who="S0671">this is my opinion of life generally</u>
<u n="375" who="S0670">okay I I agree with you to a point</u>

<u n="380" who="S0671" trans="overlap">to a point</u>
<u n="381" who="S0670">I agree that that is definitely a way that it it can be seen and also a way that it happens especially erm the kind of polar opposites of er something being loved and kind of like worshiped within a family that sticking to it or something being shunned erm because I think especially within the young teenage years erm what parents champion and love and also hate and kind of <unclear>vialise</unclear> I think those things are very very closely as you said adhered to or completely</u>
<u n="382" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="383" who="S0670">erm rebelled against by young teens but at the same time I would say although your viewpoint is one way it does happen I would also say that there are some things that people have a passion for that isn't erm directly caused by familial or friend</u>
<u n="384" who="S0671">yeah that's good</u>
<u n="385" who="S0670">or social constructs</u>
<u n="386" who="S0671" trans="overlap">and I'm pleased yes mm like erm example being <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="387" who="S0670">I mean you you could look at it broadly and say that everything er is caused by social construct IE that family is really into football the son likes playing golf they're both under the umbrella of sport and because the family</u>
<u n="388" who="S0671" trans="overlap">uhu</u>
<u n="389" who="S0670">love sport that's the social construct I think you can get very <pause dur="short"/> you can reach very widely within that idea but I I do think that there does get there there there has to be a stage where you say that is not caused by a social construct that is removed enough that that is an independent</u>
<u n="390" who="S0671" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="391" who="S0670" trans="overlap">passion</u>
<u n="392" who="S0671" trans="overlap">in in which case it would have to not be an art as in it would have to not be something with a set of rules that you have to learn from someone</u>

<u n="396" who="S0671">it can't be it can't be so it can't be erm a musical oh it could be a musical instrument if they taught it themselves <pause dur="short"/> like they just found a musical instrument and taught them themselves the musical instrument</u>
<u n="397" who="S0670">yeah</u>

<u n="399" who="S0670">but how far do you do you go with that? for example I enjoyed writing stories and writing creatively before I was taught it on you know a curriculum level</u>
<u n="400" who="S0671">okay</u>
<u n="401" who="S0670">but I read books so was I being taught by the author through that media?</u>
<u n="402" who="S0671"><trunc>ye</trunc> mm I guess you were taking line of argument then yes</u>
<u n="403" who="S0670">then in the same way that that goes if someone just picks up an instrument and you know starts playing it are they not learning that instrument through whoever created that instrument? <pause dur="long"/> music is the rearranging of notes in the same way that creative writing is rearranging of words</u>
<u n="404" who="S0671">yeah yeah good I like that yeah <pause dur="short"/> so that just kind of <pause dur="short"/> is rather <pause dur="short"/> rather dismal <pause dur="short"/> so basically <pause dur="short"/> I think then we have to look up and just say everything we learn is taught to us</u>
<u n="405" who="S0670">I would er I would disagree with that purely because although although you're taking that from what I've just said what I've just said was reductio ad absurdum</u>

<u n="457" who="S0670">to make a noise</u>
<u n="458" who="S0671" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="459" who="S0670">yes but to make an art no</u>
<u n="460" who="S0671">why is it a strong oh no okay yeah okay okay</u>
<u n="461" who="S0670" trans="overlap">in the same way that you can <trunc>ta</trunc> you can take art out of things that are not originally intended to be art you can make an orchestra out of exhausts from a car</u>
<u n="462" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="463" who="S0670">the exhaust is not made to make art the exhaust is made to be functional</u>
<u n="464" who="S0671">and this helps your point in what way? sorry I've forgotten</u>
<u n="465" who="S0670"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I think we've both forgotten</u>
<u n="466" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I think we</u>
<u n="467" who="S0670" trans="overlap">my point</u>
<u n="468" who="S0671">it's a brilliant discussion <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="469" who="S0670" trans="overlap">my point my personal belief is basically that you it's cut off is <trunc>mo</trunc>most of my argument here is that you have to have defining points in the sense that if you you can take an argument and say oh you know art is influenced by the notes which are influenced by the instrument which was influenced by the creator the creator was influenced by someone else before that I'm saying that you need to have defining points</u>
<u n="470" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="471" who="S0670">where</u>
<u n="472" who="S0671" trans="overlap">so the</u>
<u n="473" who="S0670">in in my context in writing can be influenced by a book but it's not intrinsically so you can't so in in my opinion art can be a passion that is personal as opposed to socially constructed because you don't have to be influenced by another person</u>
<u n="474" who="S0671">okay so in just sorry</u>
<u n="475" who="S0670">that's okay keep going</u>
<u n="476" who="S0671" trans="overlap">in erm in er so in that line of thinking if there was a somebody who let's say just for fun hadn't come into contact with another person</u>
<u n="477" who="S0670">uhu</u>
<u n="478" who="S0671">erm</u>

<u n="480" who="S0671" trans="overlap">would would they have the ability to create art?</u>
<u n="481" who="S0670">I think that art takes on a far more abstract</u>
<u n="482" who="S0671">yes it would</u>
<u n="483" who="S0670">definition here are you talking about art in the mind of the outsider?</u>
<u n="484" who="S0671">erm as in the mind</u>
<u n="485" who="S0670" trans="overlap">or</u>
<u n="486" who="S0671">as in <pause dur="short"/> as in would they have something of their passion <unclear>about</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> I guess would tie our argument</u>
<u n="487" who="S0670" trans="overlap">that</u>
<u n="488" who="S0671">back nicely wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="489" who="S0670">that is a wonderful point because that is saying it are again are passions inherently constructive within our society something that we're taught or</u>
<u n="490" who="S0671" trans="overlap">or can you have it without this is getting to the point</u>
<u n="491" who="S0670" trans="overlap">or is this something that the human condition is built upon?</u>
<u n="492" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="493" who="S0670" trans="overlap">is <trunc>hu</trunc> basically is human is humanity</u>
