<u n="136" who="S0687">well yeah absolutely there's issues about like privacy and people don't er at the moment the law is that you can't fly a drone within so many metres of a residence because there's cameras on them and it's like an invasion of your privacy</u>

<u n="161" who="S0689" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0687">traditionally that it would have been pronounced with a ha</u>
<u n="163" who="S0689">right</u>
<u n="164" who="S0687">so and then the pronunciation over time has changed but the orthography the spelling hasn't been updated</u>
<u n="165" who="S0689">right</u>
<u n="166" who="S0688" trans="overlap">but what about an E on the end?</u>

<u n="168" who="S0688">vine</u>
<u n="169" who="S0687">like vine erm I'm not a hundred percent sure about that to be honest <pause dur="short"/> different spelling systems</u>
<u n="170" who="S0688" trans="overlap">I thought</u>
<u n="171" who="S0687">do things in different ways like Spanish is very straightforward like how you see it is how you say it <pause dur="short"/> and then</u>
<u n="172" who="S0690" trans="overlap">there's no there's <trunc>n</trunc> so there's no erm <pause dur="short"/> non non wordies non letters</u>

<u n="178" who="S0688">I thought an E on the end changed the I like</u>
<u n="179" who="S0687">yeah from fin to fine</u>
<u n="180" who="S0688">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0687">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah so there'd have been like a need to distinguish between fin written down and fine so I'm guessing but</u>
<u n="182" who="S0688">did you see a sign this way <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0690">no I checked on the map <pause dur="short"/> just cuts that corner</u>

<u n="185" who="S0689">well it's like ye old and all that isn't it? they used to say like ye</u>
