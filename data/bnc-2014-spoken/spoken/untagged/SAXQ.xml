<u n="1" who="S0252">did you enjoy your recent trip to Goddards the home of Noel Terry</u>
<u n="2" who="S0251">yes I thought it was a good trip er it's not a very big house I thought they could have done with a bit more furniture in it and none of the furniture was actually original I don't think because a lot of the furniture was donated to Fairfax House in York because they didn't have any furniture of the period and also because he was erm an avid furniture collector</u>
<u n="3" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="4" who="S0251">it was a shame there wasn't more in the house mm I would have liked to have lived in the house I thought it was a very desirable location in York and er I like the arts and crafts style of property had a lovely garden although you would have needed quite a number of gardeners I think to maintain it to that standard</u>
<u n="5" who="S0252">be nice if they could erm buy some furniture that was sympathetic to the period</u>
<u n="6" who="S0251">yes that would give it a bit more character I think I felt it was just a little bit empty also I thought there was going to be more about the chocolate making of Terry's in the house they could have had more photographs and maybe some demonstrations to make it a bit more interesting</u>
<u n="7" who="S0252" trans="overlap">yes perhaps some free samples even?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0251">absolutely yes I think it's good to have somewhere else to visit though because we've been to most of the National Trust properties in the area several times before so it's nice to have somewhere a bit different to try for a change</u>
<u n="9" who="S0252">it is I think erm having the er membership encourages you to er visit all the local properties that you would not necessarily visit if you were not a member</u>
<u n="10" who="S0251">yes I think you're right I don't think we'd go as frequently if we didn't have the membership because it is quite pricey especially for a family but I think they're a good day out for a family er if you do have the membership tickets</u>
<u n="11" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="12" who="S0251">and when we went to Nunnington Hall which is one of my favourites in this area we were able to take a picnic so that helped keep costs down a little bit</u>
<u n="13" who="S0252">it does but if we didn't have the membership I think we'd be rather restricted in what we could do erm on our leisure trips at the weekend</u>
<u n="14" who="S0251">yes yeah I think one of my favourites in this area is Beningbrough Hall I think the one of the best exhibits there is the laundry room cos I like to see all the Victorian linens from the embroidery that appeals to me</u>
<u n="15" who="S0252">well which one do you prefer? you stated that you erm your favourites are both Beningbrough and Nunnington</u>
<u n="16" who="S0251"><vocal desc="laugh"/> erm I think probably Beningbrough is more interesting because I like the er laundry room but Nunnington is nearer and it's usually a bit quieter isn't it?</u>
<u n="17" who="S0252">it is but it is surprising erm that the number of visitors of Nunnington Hall is sixty thousand</u>
<u n="18" who="S0251">I know</u>
<u n="19" who="S0252">despite it being such a secluded location</u>
<u n="20" who="S0251">I was amazed at that er so what was that? it was in the top ten was it?</u>
<u n="21" who="S0252">no it was erm I think it was in the top a hundred</u>
<u n="22" who="S0251">oh the top one hundred mm so which is the best National Trust property that you've ever visited do you think?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0252">yeah so I have been to a number</u>
<u n="24" who="S0251">yeah you've been to quite a lot</u>
<u n="25" who="S0252">in a really good position to</u>
<u n="26" who="S0251">yes had a good</u>
<u n="27" who="S0252" trans="overlap">say I think probably erm Huston Manor was one of my favourites the the home of er Disraeli</u>
<u n="28" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="29" who="S0252">which we saw on our last holiday</u>
<u n="30" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="31" who="S0252">I think er I kind of have a a close association with Disraeli and that period because it has formed part of my studies</u>
<u n="32" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0252">I think it's nice to see the environment of which er politicians that you have studied erm live in</u>
<u n="34" who="S0251">yes cos I had never heard of that before</u>
<u n="35" who="S0252">no</u>
<u n="36" who="S0251">no I didn't I didn't know that's where he lived never really thought about it so I was quite pleased to visit it is that a less well-known property?</u>
<u n="37" who="S0252">I think it is I think in some ways it's understated</u>
<u n="38" who="S0251">mm yes and that had a nice garden as well</u>
<u n="39" who="S0252">it does</u>
<u n="40" who="S0251">cos it had well the formal garden and the vegetable garden where</u>
<u n="41" who="S0252" trans="overlap">it did</u>
<u n="42" who="S0251">they're actually growing produce so that was quite interesting</u>
<u n="43" who="S0252">I was quite surprised as how big the vegetable garden is and</u>
<u n="44" who="S0251" trans="overlap">mm yeah it was wasn't it?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0252">didn't it not have an excess of fifty varieties of apple within</u>
<u n="46" who="S0251">did it?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0252">the same garden and also the fact that it was one a slope must also have</u>
<u n="48" who="S0251" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="49" who="S0252">provided technical difficulties</u>
<u n="50" who="S0251">yes it would be more difficult to do wouldn't it? <unclear/> well</u>
<u n="51" who="S0252">did you enjoy your visit there?</u>
<u n="52" who="S0251">yes yes I think one of the things I liked best about visiting these old properties is when they have a really good kitchen I like to see the kitchen's laid out with all the copperware</u>
<u n="53" who="S0252" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="54" who="S0251">the pans which was that one? was it</u>
<u n="55" who="S0252">that was Holcombe</u>
<u n="56" who="S0251">was that Holcombe? what was the other one with <trunc>ha</trunc> flied house <pause dur="short"/>? what was that where it was <trunc>besa</trunc>? oh Hardwick <unclear>bessa</unclear> Hardwick Hall</u>
<u n="57" who="S0252" trans="overlap">Hardwick yes</u>
<u n="58" who="S0251">that had a really good kitchen didn't it?</u>
<u n="59" who="S0252">it did yes</u>
<u n="60" who="S0251">it had all those moulds for making desserts</u>
<u n="61" who="S0252">it did</u>
<u n="62" who="S0251">I think they were really nice</u>
<u n="63" who="S0252">yes <pause dur="short"/> it was a bit of a shame that er whilst they did do demonstrations that due to food hygiene restrictions you're not able to actually taste the the erm products made</u>
<u n="64" who="S0251">oh dear it goes a bit mad sometimes health and safety doesn't it?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0252">I know they're probably worried about someone er being affected by that and would create a massive erm issue</u>
<u n="66" who="S0251">and suing making a claim</u>
<u n="67" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="68" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="69" who="S0252">are there any more National Trust properties you are planning to visit in the er near or distant future?</u>
<u n="70" who="S0251">I don't think so we've been to quite a few haven't we?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0252">I think one thing that is rather disappointing is that Gladstone's house erm Hawarden Castle</u>
<u n="72" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="73" who="S0252">that's not really open to the public that they're it's really just the gardens were open a couple of afternoons a year and the actual property itself is not really accessible</u>
<u n="74" who="S0251">is that because it's privately owned?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="76" who="S0251">yes so is that not such a big house? or is it quite a good size?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0252" trans="overlap">no it is relatively big yes</u>
<u n="78" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="79" who="S0252">it's surprising in one way</u>
<u n="80" who="S0251">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think York is very well known for its chocolate making</u>
<u n="81" who="S0252">it is</u>
<u n="82" who="S0251">with the Terry family and the Rowntree family and it's a shame that most of it has been taken out of the city and gone overseas now I think it's taken the heart out of York a bit certainly the employment opportunities have been reduced</u>
<u n="83" who="S0252">absolutely</u>
<u n="84" who="S0251">and they were such philanthropists er Quaker families who were doing good works in Victorian days providing employment and social housing and facilities for the workers I don't think we'd really get nowadays do we? well I don't know of any companies that do that now erm I think Bill Gates makes a lot of donations to charities doesn't he?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0252">yes but maybe erm their role in society was to in some ways er counteract the lack of state erm aid that was provided to people because obviously</u>
<u n="86" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="87" who="S0252">in times of Terry</u>
<u n="88" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="89" who="S0252">erm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0251">Fry's and Rowntree's</u>
<u n="91" who="S0252">Fry's Rowntree's there wasn't really any sort of benefits or welfare system in place so therefore perhaps in certainly in Western Europe and er more economically developed countries there was less need now for</u>
<u n="92" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="93" who="S0252"><unclear>philanthropists</unclear></u>
<u n="94" who="S0251">yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0252">compared to what there was in the past</u>
<u n="96" who="S0251">yeah I think charity probably takes a different form now in that there's lots of charity shops which when I was younger there was probably Oxfam that's about the only one that I can remember certainly on the high street er there weren't the proliferation of charity shops that you see nowadays</u>
<u n="97" who="S0252">no</u>
<u n="98" who="S0251">also there's lots more erm fundraising events that go on all the time</u>
<u n="99" who="S0252">absolutely</u>
<u n="100" who="S0251">people doing parachute jumps and er that kind of thing cycle rides and er</u>
<u n="101" who="S0252">mm er in some ways people er are a bit too extreme at times</u>
<u n="102" who="S0251" trans="overlap">or yes they can be yes</u>
<u n="103" who="S0252">in their ways of raising money for charity</u>
<u n="104" who="S0251">yeah I certainly wouldn't want to do a parachute jump I don't think you could get insured for that do you?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0252">no no I think it's a big risk if anything er happened</u>
<u n="106" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="107" who="S0252">to the person</u>
<u n="108" who="S0251">and if something did happen how would you feel if you'd sponsored the person to do that and then they had an accident?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0252">that would be er a bit of an emotional drain</u>
<u n="110" who="S0251" trans="overlap">you yeah I mean it seems a bit of a shame really that somebody has to do something like that in order for somebody to give them the money why can't you just give them the money?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0252">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0251">or why don't you say I'll pay you not to do it?</u>
<u n="113" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="114" who="S0252">yes I think some people see it as a thrill and adventure er</u>
<u n="115" who="S0251">yes <unclear/></u>
<u n="116" who="S0252">rather than think about the potential consequences</u>
<u n="117" who="S0251">yes <pause dur="long"/> so where do you want to go on holiday next year?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0252">well it's er a difficult decision that really er there's er a few places I have in mind</u>
<u n="119" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0252">er I would like to see the the Swiss Alps and erm explore the er rich railway heritage of Switzerland</u>
<u n="121" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="122" who="S0252">which while it's not very old in the fact that they were relatively latecomers erm to railways but I think they were perhaps er much more adventurous than certain er other railways erm within Europe because I think they've chosen some really steep descents erm so steep that you having to go round in like a er a helter-skelter erm circle</u>
<u n="123" who="S0251">yes they certainly had some technical challenges to get over some of that terrain haven't they?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0252" trans="overlap">yes er I think it will be surprising if we do go up to <unclear/> which is the highest</u>
<u n="125" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="126" who="S0252">railway station in Europe</u>
<u n="127" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="128" who="S0252">also known as the top of Europe</u>
<u n="129" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="130" who="S0252">erm how much an engineering triumph it was</u>
<u n="131" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="132" who="S0252">to be able to build there so of course erm not today but a few hundred years back</u>
<u n="133" who="S0251">yes did you see the Michael Portillo programme featuring that?</u>
<u n="134" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="135" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="136" who="S0252">I thought that was a good series</u>
<u n="137" who="S0251">yes have you seen most of them?</u>
<u n="138" who="S0252">I have seen most of them I think there is definitely a lot of <unclear/> and more programmes that he could do I think one thing that they have not covered yet is the Trans-Siberian Railway which I think is an absolute</u>
<u n="139" who="S0251">oh yes</u>
<u n="140" who="S0252">incredible journey which I think people really do cover but the thing is the fact that it takes two weeks to get from erm sort of Moscow St Petersburg to Vladivostok</u>
<u n="141" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="142" who="S0252">means that it will be a maybe a ten programme series to <unclear>look at</unclear> everything on the way but on the other hand you've got to remember that erm Russia is not as densely populated</u>
<u n="143" who="S0251">no</u>
<u n="144" who="S0252">and obviously the attractions to see may be more sparse</u>
<u n="145" who="S0251">yes is that the Orient Express?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0252">that's not the Orient Express</u>
<u n="147" who="S0251">it's not the Orient Express</u>
<u n="148" who="S0252">the Orient Express is erm from Venice to Istanbul</u>
<u n="149" who="S0251">oh has he done that one?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0252">he hasn't done that one yet no</u>
<u n="151" who="S0251">oh be probably too expensive though would it?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0252">well I think it does cost quite a bit of money to go on that I think it's about er I can't remember yeah I think it's nearly two to three thousand pounds a single journey</u>
<u n="153" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="154" who="S0252">it is very expensive but obviously if it's television they've got a lots of funding to do that sort of thing</u>
<u n="155" who="S0251" trans="overlap">yes yes do you think they're trying to show things that you might be able to do? whereas if they showed that not many people would be able to avail themselves of that opportunity</u>
<u n="156" who="S0252">it's very true but at least you'd be aware of it for example I don't think most people are erm aware of what it is like inside erm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="158" who="S0252">erm obviously the places is that er you can see on the way can be accessed by normal train routes</u>
<u n="159" who="S0251" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="160" who="S0252">perhaps not the same route but certainly</u>
<u n="161" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="162" who="S0252">erm there is a valid route to take</u>
<u n="163" who="S0251" trans="overlap">yes but then once you've seen it on the television you might <trunc>sa</trunc> well I've seen it on the television now so I don't need to bother to go and spend the two thousand pounds to do it myself now so it could save you a lot of money <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="164" who="S0252">well I'm not sure about that I think seeing on the television is one thing</u>
<u n="165" who="S0251"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="166" who="S0252">and going is quite another thing I don't think you get the thrill and the experience</u>
<u n="167" who="S0251">no</u>
<u n="168" who="S0252">of the erm</u>
<u n="169" who="S0251">no I don't</u>
<u n="170" who="S0252">rail travel</u>
<u n="171" who="S0251">no</u>
<u n="172" who="S0252">and the places that you see which presumably will be very idyllic</u>
<u n="173" who="S0251">I'd still like to do it but I think watching it on the television might be the nearest I ever get</u>
<u n="174" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0251">although if you want an economy compromise you could go on the North York Railway couldn't you?</u>
<u n="176" who="S0252"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="177" who="S0251">North Yorkshire Moors Railway on the erm they've got some nineteen thirties carriages haven't they?</u>
<u n="178" who="S0252">yes they have</u>
<u n="179" who="S0251">where you can have a dining experience</u>
<u n="180" who="S0252">well erm they claim that that is erm in fact better than the Orient Express</u>
<u n="181" who="S0251">in what way? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="182" who="S0252">because the Orient Express is diesel hauled whereas erm</u>
<u n="183" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="184" who="S0252">the North York Moors Railway can be steam hauled at times</u>
<u n="185" who="S0251">true I think that would be more atmospheric don't you?</u>
<u n="186" who="S0252">it would but I think it's from a technical point of view one thing is that steam can actually damage the overhead wires</u>
<u n="187" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0252">if it gets too close</u>
<u n="189" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="190" who="S0252">depending on what wires are made <unclear/></u>
<u n="191" who="S0251">mm would you be able to realise from inside whether it was diesel or steam? or is it just from an enthusiast's point of view?</u>
<u n="192" who="S0252">I think it would probably be more from an enthusiast's point of view I know if I'm on a train I can tell</u>
<u n="193" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="194" who="S0252">that it's er diesel electric or steam</u>
<u n="195" who="S0251">right</u>
<u n="196" who="S0252">but if I couldn't see anything</u>
<u n="197" who="S0251">no</u>
<u n="198" who="S0252">you'll be giving me a bit more of a challenge</u>
<u n="199" who="S0251">yes most people wouldn't probably realise unless you look out of the window</u>
<u n="200" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="201" who="S0251">yes when you're on a curve then you can see the steam billowing overhead</u>
<u n="202" who="S0252" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="203" who="S0251">I think that looks very attractive doesn't it?</u>
<u n="204" who="S0252">but really the er tell tail signs for an electric is really before you get on you'll see it <unclear/></u>
<u n="205" who="S0251">right</u>
<u n="206" who="S0252">on the <unclear>book</unclear> on the roof of the train whereas</u>
<u n="207" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="208" who="S0252">on a diesel you are not going to see that</u>
<u n="209" who="S0251">no some people have said that meals are not really very good value on that service haven't they?</u>
<u n="210" who="S0252">mm well it certainly is a a little bit of an investment</u>
<u n="211" who="S0251">I think it's something that you're only going to do once really for a special occasion possibly</u>
<u n="212" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="213" who="S0251">so I think it might be worth it just to have the experience</u>
<u n="214" who="S0252">absolutely</u>
<u n="215" who="S0251">of saying that you've done that and enjoying it and</u>
<u n="216" who="S0252">that's one thing I think about the Venice to something Orient Express</u>
<u n="217" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="218" who="S0252">I do at least hope to do it once in my lifetime</u>
<u n="219" who="S0251">really?</u>
<u n="220" who="S0252">just so that I can say I've been on it and</u>
<u n="221" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="222" who="S0252">have the atmosphere of it</u>
<u n="223" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="224" who="S0252">I must admit I'm not a wholly convinced of the way that cabins are formed on the er kind of overnight sleeper trains</u>
<u n="225" who="S0251">no <unclear/></u>
<u n="226" who="S0252">I was personally expecting that it would be like a more like a small hotel room</u>
<u n="227" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="228" who="S0252">but actually it's erm kind of like a couchette</u>
<u n="229" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="230" who="S0252">in the day and then you fold the couchette over and erm and some overhead er</u>
<u n="231" who="S0251">beds come down</u>
<u n="232" who="S0252">beds to form it like that so</u>
<u n="233" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="234" who="S0252">it's really more like a bunk bed arrangement</u>
<u n="235" who="S0251">right but do you have to share with people that you don't know?</u>
<u n="236" who="S0252">well I think if you if you go by yourself then you would but if there I think there are cabins for two three and four</u>
<u n="237" who="S0251">for a family</u>
<u n="238" who="S0252">up to six people</u>
<u n="239" who="S0251">yes yeah I think that'd be really good and do you is it a nineteen thirties style or?</u>
<u n="240" who="S0252">erm I think it is yes</u>
<u n="241" who="S0251">is that steam or diesel?</u>
<u n="242" who="S0252">it's it's diesel yes</u>
<u n="243" who="S0251">it's diesel mm</u>
<u n="244" who="S0252">so obviously I they're both very er places with charisma</u>
<u n="245" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="246" who="S0252">Venice and</u>
<u n="247" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="248" who="S0252">Istanbul I think they're very distinct</u>
<u n="249" who="S0251">yeah I really liked Venice a lot more than I thought I would because I was actually surprised at how clear the water was</u>
<u n="250" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="251" who="S0251">I thought it might be erm a bit er dirty or smelly but it was absolutely crystal clear and you could see all the plants sparkling through the water and the fish I thought it was really good</u>
<u n="252" who="S0252">the authorities have done well to keep it like that</u>
<u n="253" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="254" who="S0252">but I suppose the tourist influence must provide a lot of money for</u>
<u n="255" who="S0251">definitely</u>
<u n="256" who="S0252">the <unclear>Bento</unclear> region</u>
<u n="257" who="S0251">yes yeah I thought it was really a thrill to go on that Grand Canal tour the first day that we were there</u>
<u n="258" who="S0252">yes</u>
<u n="259" who="S0251">we went the full length didn't we?</u>
<u n="260" who="S0252">we did up to <unclear/></u>
<u n="261" who="S0251">yeah that was really good</u>
<u n="262" who="S0252">one thing that I did see was that erm the Venice authorities are planning to charge people to come into Venice if they do not stay in Venice itself because they are complaining that they are not getting enough money from the tourists to maintain things because if you stay in Venice you have to pay a city tax which is payable to the local authority</u>
<u n="263" who="S0251">I don't think that's a very good idea I think that's a bit mean really that you've got to pay just to go into the city are there any other examples of that?</u>
<u n="264" who="S0252">erm I think that would set a precedent</u>
<u n="265" who="S0251">I don't know of anywhere else you where you've got to pay to go in?</u>
<u n="266" who="S0252">no</u>
<u n="267" who="S0251"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I think that's a bit excessive</u>
<u n="268" who="S0252">it is and also you've got to think of the erm other such as people spending money in cafes</u>
<u n="269" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="270" who="S0252">and erm</u>
<u n="271" who="S0251">absolutely</u>
<u n="272" who="S0252">gift shops that sort of thing</u>
<u n="273" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="274" who="S0252">which obviously they collect erm er</u>
<u n="275" who="S0251">business rates</u>
<u n="276" who="S0252" trans="overlap">business rates</u>
<u n="277" who="S0251">yes so</u>
<u n="278" who="S0252">obviously if people didn't shop there</u>
<u n="279" who="S0251">no</u>
<u n="280" who="S0252">they wouldn't be able to <unclear>tax</unclear> that</u>
<u n="281" who="S0251">well it would boost the local economy and prices were expensive anyway weren't they</u>
<u n="282" who="S0252">they were</u>
<u n="283" who="S0251">in cafes and ice creams and so on</u>
<u n="284" who="S0252">yes</u>
