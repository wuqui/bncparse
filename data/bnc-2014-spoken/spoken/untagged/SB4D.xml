<u n="1016" who="S0197">yeah and all the feeling about it it's sort of the relaxation part of it and you just do as much as you possibly can which is what the the erm instructor was sort of saying to to us just just try and stretch as must as much as you possibly can</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0192">yeah</u>

<u n="1946" who="S0192">yeah erm <pause dur="short"/> I had to walk through a typhoon Bolaven was the first one and it was like it hit Mokpo pretty hard and I and my school was closed so I got the email saying the kids aren't coming in but erm you've got to come in and the teachers need to you know batten down the hatches and protect the school I was like this is joke I've only been here for three days and I'm looking outside and it had been crazy all night I could see where er erm <pause dur="short"/> a cross had fallen off the roof of a smashed car like just outside the wind was still flipping roof tiles everywhere there was like no power it was raining really really heavily <trunc>spar</trunc> when I was walking like sparks were flying off like things water was up to about here like everywhere</u>

<u n="1949" who="S0199">that's ridiculous</u>
<u n="1950" who="S0192" trans="overlap">bit dangerous so I was already a bit annoyed about that and then the net week I had the first day of my new school on a Thursday I didn't know exactly where the school was but it was fine I was going to tell a taxi and I knew enough Korean to kind of get there but there was another typhoon Typhoon Tembin hit the exact day of my new school and I was all suited and booted and like couldn't get in a taxi <trunc>be</trunc> in Korea there were taxis everywhere but when the weather's bad everyone wants a taxi and they call them and I don't have a phone so I was out waiting on this corner getting drenched like trying to and a you know the wind's blowing the rain on my shoes and it's like going everywhere couldn't get one so I had to walk about half an hour and then I'm like asking round the people on the street how to get this school and I I just turned up and was completely drenched hopefully half expecting to like you know give me a change of clothes or do something</u>

<u n="1980" who="S0192">but I don't know if America gets bigger ones than this they tend to hit Japan a lot and the Philippines a lot the Philippines gets hit by some pretty big ones every year it just tears through them</u>
<u n="1981" who="S0199">scary</u>
<u n="1982" who="S0192">Japan gets hit by everything it's ridiculous Korea is just like completely safe you see the we watched them cos they've got like a weather report and you see the typhoons coming in and they track them pretty much always they're like gonna hit Korea and then at the last minute they veer right and like just go straight over Japan or pretty much eight out of ten typhoons end up not actually hitting Korea</u>
<u n="1983" who="S0199" trans="overlap">oh my gosh</u>
<u n="1984" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and just going straight through <trunc>k</trunc> straight through Japan there's a lot of like every season there's probably like twenty to thirty typhoons that are like hitting the area</u>
<u n="1985" who="S0197">in American they <trunc>n</trunc> they name them don't they?</u>
<u n="1986" who="S0192">yeah they do yeah</u>
<u n="1987" who="S0197">with the but they start from the beginning of the alphabet</u>
<u n="1988" who="S0192">yeah it's the beginning of the alphabet</u>
<u n="1989" who="S0197">but it's and is it female then male female male or is it</u>
<u n="1990" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah something like that</u>
<u n="1991" who="S0197" trans="overlap">all females in the next season something like that it's like</u>
<u n="1992" who="S0192">are they just all females?</u>
<u n="1993" who="S0197">no I think they they alternate it</u>
<u n="1994" who="S0192">yeah they do <trunc>altern</trunc></u>
<u n="1995" who="S0197" trans="overlap">but whether they alternate it in the same year or if the next year it's going to be male</u>
<u n="1996" who="S0192">it's all male and then that year it's all female</u>
<u n="1997" who="S0197" trans="overlap">yeah yeah something like that</u>
<u n="1998" who="S0192">terrible</u>
<u n="1999" who="S0197">so when you get up to hurricane Zelda I mean they'll have had the year</u>

<u n="2003" who="S0192">they had that erm polar vortex did you hear about that at all? like massive it was a year ago did you hear about that? maybe two years ago</u>
<u n="2004" who="S0197">no</u>
<u n="2005" who="S0192">massive parts of the country were sub-zero temperatures like minus thirty minus forty like minus fifty in some parts even in Tennessee which is pretty far south was down to like minus twenty and like everywhere was frozen for quite a while England actually that was when we got a lot of flooding it was the same storm</u>
<u n="2006" who="S0199">oh</u>
<u n="2007" who="S0192">it was the same system</u>
<u n="2008" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="2009" who="S0192">but they were being frozen the whole of America got like frozen and</u>
<u n="2010" who="S0199" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah yeah I do remember yeah</u>
<u n="2011" who="S0192" trans="overlap">did you not hear about that?</u>
<u n="2012" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="2013" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and you were getting the same weather system</u>
<u n="2014" who="S0199">yeah I do remember</u>
<u n="2015" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but it was causing it to drop the water</u>
<u n="2016" who="S0197">mm</u>
<u n="2017" who="S0192">but America was getting hit pretty hard with that as well</u>
<u n="2018" who="S0197">I think it gets a like a knock-on effect from like a a massive tidal wave like happened in Sri Lanka a few years ago</u>
<u n="2019" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2020" who="S0197">and it just er affects the weather system so much and it just a knock-on effect to everybody <trunc>el</trunc> <trunc>el</trunc> everywhere else on the globe</u>
<u n="2021" who="S0192">I definitely notice patterns with here and in Korea like we seem to have similar weather patterns depending on the year if this year you're getting a lot of rain then we seem to be getting a lot of rain also and for another year it's quite hot and drought</u>
<u n="2022" who="S0199" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="2023" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and it seems to be like over there as well</u>

<u n="2025" who="S0197">really?</u>
<u n="2026" who="S0192">yeah there's definitely seems to be I don't know if that's just a bit of a coincidence</u>
<u n="2027" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="2028" who="S0192">but there'd definitely been some correlation between what's going on in Europe and what's going on in Asia I mean it makes sense the big old big old weather systems <pause dur="short"/> the monsoons are completely controlled by the Himalayas if the Himalayas weren't there they wouldn't have the monsoons that they have</u>

<u n="2033" who="S0197">it's like a base in North Wales er I think it might be <unclear>Bol Afaloo</unclear> which like have been the north part of the <unclear>Snowdon</unclear> on one side of the mountain is the driest part of Wales and then the other side of the mountain is the wettest part of this part of Wales and like about two miles difference between the two and it's just amazing and that's just all coming off the coast with the the high and the low pressure</u>
<u n="2034" who="S0192">yeah it dumps it just off the mountain yeah</u>
<u n="2035" who="S0197">yeah so it's all comes under high pressure and it's really nice this side and it it goes over the mountain and you get the the low</u>
