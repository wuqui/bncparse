<u n="11" who="S0618">if you book through the website you get this protection and that protection blah blah blah so I'm not so happy about just sending money to a random bank account</u>
<u n="12" who="S0619">uhu</u>
<u n="13" who="S0618">she could've been hacked or whatever</u>
<u n="14" who="S0619" trans="overlap">and you have to pay for international transfer</u>

<u n="16" who="S0619" trans="overlap">oh no</u>
<u n="17" who="S0618">or is running out and curious thing in Northern Ireland you can have either erm and post offices in Northern Ireland will give you a form for down south Ireland</u>

<u n="25" who="S0618">public service</u>
<u n="26" who="S0619">uhu</u>

<u n="32" who="S0619">ah</u>

<u n="34" who="S0619" trans="overlap">nice</u>

<u n="49" who="S0618">you are I know</u>
<u n="50" who="S0619">getting stronger and stronger</u>
<u n="51" who="S0618">yay</u>
<u n="52" who="S0619">erm you know it's really funny if he really pushes it or I push myself and he sort of helps</u>
<u n="53" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="54" who="S0619">er</u>
<u n="55" who="S0618">when did you see him again?</u>
<u n="56" who="S0619">at ten today</u>
<u n="57" who="S0618">today? oh my god</u>
<u n="58" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so that's why I'm sweating so much</u>
<u n="59" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="60" who="S0619">cos I ran home had a shower ate <trunc>s</trunc> hot food walked here</u>
<u n="61" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="62" who="S0619">with a coat on and it's really hot</u>
<u n="63" who="S0618">it's really hot outside I know</u>
<u n="64" who="S0619"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/> my nose is sweating still</u>
<u n="65" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="66" who="S0619">erm so upper body really good erm I think sometimes <unclear>it's</unclear> surprising with how strong some parts of my body are</u>
<u n="67" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0619" trans="overlap">and then <vocal desc="laugh"/> really surprised er with how weak the rest some bits are</u>
<u n="69" who="S0618" trans="overlap">other bits are yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0619">so we were you know doing whatever and I was holding again this weight which weighs nothing half a bag of sugar and I was just like what?</u>
<u n="71" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="72" who="S0619">that's enough oh so he was like <vocal desc="laugh"/> right do ten with this er <trunc>h</trunc> tiny tiny weight and then do ten with just moving your arms</u>
<u n="73" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="74" who="S0619">it's just like I'm so weak <vocal desc="laugh"/> my exercise is just moving my arms up and down <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="75" who="S0618" trans="overlap">oh my god have you ever been to a craniologist?</u>
<u n="76" who="S0619">no</u>
<u n="77" who="S0618">it's erm like a bizarre branch of osteopathy or erm chiropractic or whatever</u>
<u n="78" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0618">erm and they play about with bits in your head</u>
<u n="80" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0618">and I used to see this guy I think he was a chiropractor primarily erm but he would do these sort of strength test things</u>
<u n="82" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0618">by getting you to hold up an arm or push here or pull there or whatever and based on that and where he detected weaknesses</u>
<u n="84" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0618">he would then prod bits on my head and like really push into bits on your skull</u>
<u n="86" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0618">and then he'd like leave me to set for five minutes and then he'd come back and do the strength test again and it was so different</u>
<u n="88" who="S0619"><unclear>that's weird</unclear></u>
<u n="89" who="S0618">how weird is that?</u>
<u n="90" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0618">so yeah google that</u>
<u n="92" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0618">craniology it's erm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0618">yeah it's nuts I'm not sure of the science behind it but he obviously linked it in with chiropractic</u>
<u n="96" who="S0619">yeah no it's just you know I really worked on you know if er if you notice like really quick improvements you tend to do that more than where the <trunc>res</trunc> the improvements are slow</u>
<u n="97" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0619">so those bits naturally become the weakest over time</u>
<u n="99" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0619">so whereas I can fling around eighteen kilos with one arm like it's nothing</u>
<u n="101" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0619">I can't hold a two kilogram plate in front of me with</u>
<u n="103" who="S0618">in front of you yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0619" trans="overlap">without like dropping it or falling over</u>
<u n="105" who="S0618"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="106" who="S0619">but oh it's all fine</u>
<u n="107" who="S0618">good for you though</u>
<u n="108" who="S0619" trans="overlap">I'll get there <pause dur="short"/> it'll get there</u>
<u n="109" who="S0618" trans="overlap">well I'm pleased you can walk again <vocal desc="laugh"/> that was a little bit of a concern these last few days so</u>
<u n="110" who="S0619">I know cos I was when we got back I was just sort of googling it and if you tear or pull a muscle there's three stages</u>
<u n="111" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0619">and the first one is it hurts but you don't have any sort of noticeable limp er you know you can still walk the second one which is what I think I had but quite severely is noticeable limp hurts to do anything twinges</u>
<u n="113" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0619">and a slow pain it hurts even when you're sitting or lying</u>
<u n="115" who="S0618">yeah that was you</u>
<u n="116" who="S0619" trans="overlap">and then the third one is like completely fucked can't do anything at all ever</u>
<u n="117" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="118" who="S0619">and you hear when it happens you hear like a pop</u>
<u n="119" who="S0618">oh okay</u>
<u n="120" who="S0619">of like the muscle like coming into pieces</u>
<u n="121" who="S0618">eh</u>
<u n="122" who="S0619">I didn't have that one erm and it said</u>
<u n="123" who="S0618" trans="overlap">but you just had a bad number two?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0619">and it said sort of er a week two weeks until back to normal erm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0618">you've been less than a week</u>
<u n="128" who="S0619">yeah so</u>
<u n="129" who="S0618" trans="overlap">spirulina <pause dur="short"/> ah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0619" trans="overlap">well it still is sore and I said for the training on Monday we'll just have to do upper body again</u>
<u n="131" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0619">I don't want it to go bad</u>
<u n="133" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0619">and with the calves I just said only bodyweight</u>
<u n="135" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="136" who="S0619">no</u>
<u n="137" who="S0618">no additional</u>
<u n="138" who="S0619">two-thirds of my bodyweight weight <unclear/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="139" who="S0618" trans="overlap">jeez</u>
<u n="140" who="S0619">erm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0618">I know that's pretty crazy to start with really</u>
<u n="142" who="S0619">mm yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0618">and they're difficult muscles to warm up as well cos</u>
<u n="144" who="S0619" trans="overlap">uhu uhu</u>
<u n="145" who="S0618">really you're sort of warming them up with your bodyweight cos that's</u>
<u n="146" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0618">the minimum you can do and</u>
<u n="148" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0618">sometimes that's just enough</u>
<u n="150" who="S0619">so we'll just have to take it slowly</u>
<u n="151" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0619">he said do you want to skip it all together? I said no</u>
<u n="153" who="S0618" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="154" who="S0619">because that's stupid we'll just have to do it really sort of sensibly</u>
<u n="155" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0619">er cos you know the my legs can hack a hell of a lot like they can take a lot of weight</u>
<u n="157" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="158" who="S0619">erm but apart from my calves can't <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="159" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="S0619">but they will eventually</u>
<u n="161" who="S0618">yeah you can do calf raises every time you make a cup of tea or something</u>
<u n="162" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0618">and that will at least train sort of train the muscles to get used to working cos you don't</u>
<u n="164" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0618">traditionally work those muscles unless you climb mountains every weekend</u>
<u n="166" who="S0619">yeah or you're sort of reaching up to put stuff on shelves</u>
<u n="167" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0619"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear>but you know anything</unclear> like that but most of the time not really but</u>
<u n="169" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0619">anyway we'll see what happens</u>
<u n="171" who="S0618" trans="overlap">good for you that's brilliant</u>
<u n="172" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah so I'm feeling really good</u>
<u n="173" who="S0618">cool <pause dur="short"/> good</u>
<u n="174" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah and I just needed yesterday to you know just</u>
<u n="175" who="S0618">stare at the wall?</u>
<u n="176" who="S0619">well not necessarily stare at the wall but you know</u>
<u n="177" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="178" who="S0619">I cleaned on Wednesday when</u>
<u n="179" who="S0618" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="180" who="S0619">I got in and then yesterday I just spent more time</u>
<u n="181" who="S0618" trans="overlap"><unclear/> clean</u>
<u n="182" who="S0619">you know doing boring stuff like clearing out the kitchen cupboards wiping them down and putting stuff back in in a more logical order</u>
<u n="183" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0619"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and doing the same in my bedroom and sorting out all my drawers</u>
<u n="185" who="S0618">yeah that's really cool</u>
<u n="186" who="S0619">I think it just helps to get it done erm</u>
<u n="187" who="S0618">and again to my mind the physical always always the last place to manifest so that's a lot of clearing out on the inside</u>
<u n="188" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0618">that's</u>
<u n="190" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="191" who="S0618">you know now a lot more readable on the outside</u>
<u n="192" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah and I had like so much energy to do it I think <unclear>cos I was just</unclear></u>
<u n="193" who="S0618" trans="overlap">good</u>
<u n="194" who="S0619"><unclear>inside I was going a bit</unclear> stir crazy but</u>
<u n="195" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="196" who="S0619">yeah so it's it needs <trunc>ano</trunc> er there's just dust and dirt and hair everywhere</u>
<u n="197" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="198" who="S0619">it's <unclear/> sweep <unclear/> Cinderella</u>
<u n="199" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="200" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="201" who="S0619">but yeah</u>
<u n="202" who="S0618">I find dust seems to accumulate incredibly quickly</u>
<u n="203" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="204" who="S0618">I've no I've no idea why unless it's because it's been cold and people have been burning all sorts of shit</u>
<u n="205" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="206" who="S0618">cos there's generally a lot of black smoke chugging out of chimneys</u>
<u n="207" who="S0619">mm mm</u>
<u n="208" who="S0618">I just presume people have saved up all their plastic during the summer months <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="209" who="S0619">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="210" who="S0618" trans="overlap">and as soon as winter started burned it erm but yeah they do does seem to be a lot of black smoke out of chimneys maybe it's residue from that coming in <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="211" who="S0619">yeah I don't know</u>
<u n="212" who="S0618">yeah <unclear/> it's weird</u>

<u n="218" who="S0618" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="219" who="S0619">it's cos your skin's drier in winter anyway I suppose</u>
<u n="220" who="S0618">for sure</u>
<u n="221" who="S0619">don't know erm but finally it's er some sort of assemblance of order</u>
