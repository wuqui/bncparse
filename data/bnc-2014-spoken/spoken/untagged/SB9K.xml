<u n="1" who="S0192">what did you get sorted today then?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0198">I started to build a I've separated my seminars next week into three separate documents and I'm just pasting over the quotes that I think might be useful for that particular day</u>
<u n="3" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="4" who="S0198">some of them might not be relevant but I feel like at some point they'll be general discussion points</u>
<u n="5" who="S0192" trans="overlap">might be able to</u>
<u n="6" who="S0198">that I can sort of bring up at any time</u>
<u n="7" who="S0192">might be able to bring it up</u>
<u n="8" who="S0198">erm just starting to do that really organising my quotes I've read through a few things quite a lot of information we've studied so far isn't there?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="10" who="S0198">we've studied quite a bit</u>
<u n="11" who="S0192">definitely</u>
<u n="12" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0192">erm well we've been doing it for a few months now <vocal desc="laugh"/> haven't we?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0198">but then I've got I mean the second language acquisition and research I've got quite a lot of specific things that I have to prepare before Wednesday lots to do first it's all about introduction and defining language and then complete this questionnaire and also he's attached this to it which is something completely different I guess these are quotes to go along with what we're doing here what is language? how do we use it? and things like that but</u>
<u n="15" who="S0192">mm yeah all I've done so far is sorted everything out done my library referencing and printed the things off I need I still need to erm do the things that they've set me to do</u>
<u n="16" who="S0198">yeah yeah that's what I <unclear/> do</u>
<u n="17" who="S0192">and do the readings that they've set me to do</u>
<u n="18" who="S0198" trans="overlap">and just I haven't even finished organising those ideas yet I mean I've still gotta do I mean we've got today and tomorrow and also <unclear>look</unclear> we've got Monday and Tuesday and <trunc>Wed</trunc> you know it's not</u>
<u n="19" who="S0192">no yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0198">and what <trunc>conc</trunc> slightly concerned <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is <unclear>they're</unclear> gonna start uploading <vocal desc="cough"/> er <trunc>pr</trunc> er specifics for language variation until the day before or something cos he hasn't done anything for preparation for that week <unclear/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0192">no I emailed the language description analysis lady cos although she's given me a load of pre-readings she hasn't actually set us anything to do</u>
<u n="22" who="S0198">no no</u>
<u n="23" who="S0192">whereas pidgins and creoles and syntactic theory have both set me</u>
<u n="24" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0192"><unclear/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0198">don't really know whether to email him or whether that was kinda hassling him because</u>
<u n="27" who="S0192">it might be hassling him a little bit <unclear/></u>
<u n="28" who="S0198">he did say yesterday he is uploading bits by bit <unclear/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0192">I mean you're all in the same boat</u>
<u n="30" who="S0198">yes exactly</u>
<u n="31" who="S0192">so if he hasn't uploaded it for you he hasn't uploaded it for anyone so</u>
<u n="32" who="S0198">and I'm sure like with the general general erm general reading I've done it's erm even if he hasn't set anything as long as I go in there with a collection of quotes about <unclear>and</unclear> just copying over summarising what the basically the opening sentences they include in introductions to socio-linguistic books just have a bunch of them on there about language variation and what essentially it is</u>
<u n="33" who="S0192">I mean</u>
<u n="34" who="S0198">so as long as I can participate in that respect of it <unclear>I don't know what more</unclear></u>
<u n="35" who="S0192">he seemed pretty chilled to me</u>
<u n="36" who="S0198">it's called an introduction anyway the first seminar so yeah he does seem pretty chill I wonder what they're gonna do about <pause dur="short"/> the erm the clash that I have on my timetable</u>
<u n="37" who="S0192">yeah I mean if they're expecting us</u>
<u n="38" who="S0198" trans="overlap">cos in my head I had three to six again</u>
<u n="39" who="S0192" trans="overlap">if these things are mandatory I bet you'll get away with it I bet you won't have to do it <unclear/></u>
<u n="40" who="S0198" trans="overlap">I it's it's possible they might tell me that I can I just do the first two hours and I always lose the third hour or they might say we give this slot one to three but we don't actually they don't actually go on for three hours</u>
<u n="41" who="S0192">what do you mean if it's two hours?</u>
<u n="42" who="S0198">well that I do one to <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="43" who="S0192">one to three is only two hours</u>
<u n="44" who="S0198">oh then I do the first hour then</u>
<u n="45" who="S0192">yeah so you just come in and do an hour <unclear>before the next class</unclear></u>
<u n="46" who="S0198">oh yeah sorry erm one to three is only two hours</u>
<u n="47" who="S0192"><unclear>that is a bit naff</unclear></u>
<u n="48" who="S0198">they didn't yeah they obviously hadn't thought that through or if we're lucky they'll look at the timetable for whatever reason it can be done earlier that day</u>
<u n="49" who="S0192">that would be nice</u>
<u n="50" who="S0198">but that would depend on</u>
<u n="51" who="S0192">chances are they'll move your thing later</u>
<u n="52" who="S0198">er what? my language <trunc>s</trunc>?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0192">second language acquisition</u>
<u n="54" who="S0198">yeah I mean I suppose they can do can't they?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0192"><unclear/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0198">but just for me? that seems a bit mm harsh think about</u>
<u n="57" who="S0192">it's not just for you it's for everyone oh</u>
<u n="58" who="S0198">no it's not cos er most of the people</u>
<u n="59" who="S0192">you're right unless they're required to go to these as well</u>
<u n="60" who="S0198">but most people <unclear>will</unclear> unless they're required to do something similar which they might be er might do</u>
<u n="61" who="S0192">they might be mightn't they? cos it's just general language and linguistics erm</u>
<u n="62" who="S0198">ah I was quite looking forward to finishing at five that day but</u>
<u n="63" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/> well my</u>
<u n="64" who="S0198">six seems so late</u>
<u n="65" who="S0192">my timetable's mental <unclear>like</unclear></u>
<u n="66" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0192">I feel like I've got quite a lot to do</u>
<u n="68" who="S0198">with these added sessions</u>
<u n="69" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I've got four <trunc>f</trunc></u>
<u n="70" who="S0198">every other week it's like you know that's like another module and you</u>
<u n="71" who="S0192">well basically I'm in uni four days a week and out of those four days two of them I'm in uni well one I'm in uni for eleven till six another one I'm in uni from nine till three</u>
<u n="72" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0192">that's quite long days</u>
<u n="74" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0192">and I've got two full long days like that you haven't got shit that even compares to that</u>
<u n="76" who="S0198">no</u>
<u n="77" who="S0192">it's rubbish I'm not actually best pleased about that</u>
<u n="78" who="S0198">but you can use that time in between to just study at uni</u>
<u n="79" who="S0192">but it's a lot more work that means I have to have the books that I need for class plus the books that I need to study with plus I need to bring my laptop on top of my food I don't see how I'm going to be able to carry all of this</u>
<u n="80" who="S0198">well just take your laptop <unclear/></u>
<u n="81" who="S0192">when you actually think about these things practically it's not actually that easy</u>
<u n="82" who="S0198" trans="overlap">well I'm sure I know I understand that but er it's not easy but you're you're very organised you're very able I think that you can maximise this time quite successfully</u>
<u n="83" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I know it's just extra stress that I don't really need</u>
<u n="84" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah I know</u>
<u n="85" who="S0192">I'm not</u>
<u n="86" who="S0198">you'd prefer to come home obviously</u>
<u n="87" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I don't study do you want a cigarette by the way? I've rolled one</u>
<u n="88" who="S0198">yeah okay I'll have a little of that one</u>
<u n="89" who="S0192">erm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0198">even if you just study the lesson that you er</u>
<u n="91" who="S0192">I mean I've gotta deal with it haven't I? I haven't got any choice</u>
<u n="92" who="S0198" trans="overlap">the lecture that you had that morning <unclear/></u>
<u n="93" who="S0192">I know I know</u>
<u n="94" who="S0198">do the lecture and then do the seminar work that's set for the following class or whatever <unclear/></u>
<u n="95" who="S0192">I may have to</u>
<u n="96" who="S0198">do the seminar and just focus on one thing during that time</u>
<u n="97" who="S0192" trans="overlap">depends if she's put it up though isn't it? because erm on Wednesday I've just finished a pidgins and creoles seminar</u>
<u n="98" who="S0198">you'll have oh okay yeah yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0192">so she may not've yet uploaded next week's lecture and <trunc>semin</trunc>seminar</u>
<u n="100" who="S0198" trans="overlap">lectures <unclear/> whatever <vocal desc="yawn"/> but I'm sure you'll have work to do</u>
<u n="101" who="S0192">and I don't have access to a printer or anything and like</u>
<u n="102" who="S0198"><unclear>I mean</unclear> you can print at uni <unclear/></u>
<u n="103" who="S0192"><unclear>but that's and</unclear> then have to put money on that</u>
<u n="104" who="S0198">mm I think if you just go to the library find yourself a little corner it's just</u>
<u n="105" who="S0192">I'm gonna have to</u>
<u n="106" who="S0198">just focus on one thing that day</u>
<u n="107" who="S0192">I'm gonna have to take in my laptop and but it's just seems like a lot to carry and then I have to prepare I have to make sure I've got food ready and <unclear>like</unclear> all that kinda it's just a lot more work for me</u>
<u n="108" who="S0198" trans="overlap">I mean yeah you do have to take food in those days don't you?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0192">yeah it's just a lot more work for me <pause dur="short"/> that's all but it can't really be avoided can it?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0192">it just means that next semester I may very well just do the core modules</u>
<u n="112" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0192">depending on how I find this it's a shame cos I'd like to do phrenology and I'd like to do quite like to do world Englishes as well <unclear>but</unclear> erm depends how well I cope with this semester</u>
<u n="114" who="S0198" trans="overlap">cos world Englishes is just fifteen</u>
<u n="115" who="S0192">yeah I don't really understand</u>
<u n="116" who="S0198">it's a post-grad but it's fifteen</u>
<u n="117" who="S0192">yeah so they don't offer it to undergraduates I guess</u>
<u n="118" who="S0198">yeah okay</u>
<u n="119" who="S0192">but it's still a lesser weight</u>
<u n="120" who="S0198">I wonder why? it must build on <unclear>some of the theory that they have in</unclear> <unclear/> I don't know why they won't <unclear/> offer it to an undergrad</u>
<u n="121" who="S0192">research in language and use erm I don't really understand how it works it's fifteen credits the same as pidgins and creoles yeah?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="123" who="S0192">except in pidgins and creoles they do two hours a week</u>
<u n="124" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0192">and syntactic theory in research in language and use we do one and a half research in language and use is just two papers and the other ones I've got presentations and four papers</u>
<u n="126" who="S0198">I know</u>
<u n="127" who="S0192">they don't seem weighted correctly you can't really call them both fifteen credits <unclear/></u>
<u n="128" who="S0198">I guess the er yeah <unclear>no they're not</unclear> I guess the research in language and use is just er the <trunc>cr</trunc> you know they put the minimum amount of credit they can to it or something <unclear>and that's</unclear></u>
<u n="129" who="S0192">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> did say that it <trunc>w</trunc> took more organisation to do the</u>
<u n="130" who="S0198">yeah yeah she did yeah she didn't sound like yeah it was an easier option at all so just gotta see how it goes I suppose <unclear>it's</unclear> just stay organised stay on top of it hopefully as you said after we've met everyone yesterday you know people are gonna need guidance through this sort of thing aren't they? I guess that's what these Wednesday things are about I dunno</u>
<u n="131" who="S0192">I don't know what that's about really why <trunc>w</trunc> I didn't fully understand it we just listen to their</u>
<u n="132" who="S0198">I don't know</u>
<u n="133" who="S0192">hear about their research? <unclear/></u>
<u n="134" who="S0198">I guess it's it's the they're <trunc>s</trunc> trying to give us ideas during that time</u>
<u n="135" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="136" who="S0198">dissertation ideas and how you go about doing it I suppose so that we <unclear/> something</u>
<u n="137" who="S0192">I was only in uni nine hours a week undergrad er <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="138" who="S0198">I know</u>
<u n="139" who="S0192">twelve hours a week now</u>
<u n="140" who="S0198">I know I actually thought there would be less contact time erm than there is going to be certainly <unclear/></u>
<u n="141" who="S0192">ah it is a masters isn't it?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="144" who="S0198">guess you're paying for it</u>
<u n="145" who="S0192">yeah you are</u>
<u n="146" who="S0198">get as much out of it as possible</u>
<u n="147" who="S0192">it's certainly not cheap is it?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0198">no</u>
<u n="149" who="S0192">six thousand pounds</u>
<u n="150" who="S0198">could be more <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said his cost seven</u>
<u n="151" who="S0192">oh did it?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0198">and I don't think he did I'm pretty sure he's at <anon type="place"/> and not <anon type="place"/> I'm not positive</u>
<u n="153" who="S0192">I mean certain masters cost different amounts <unclear/> <unclear>you do</unclear></u>
<u n="154" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah maybe because he does lab stuff and things like that</u>
<u n="155" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0198"><unclear>you know</unclear> yeah I know science masters I <trunc>w</trunc> I don't know how much did <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> say how much his cost <unclear>there</unclear>?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0192">eight yeah I think or nine or something</u>
<u n="158" who="S0198">eight or nine at <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="159" who="S0192">I mean all the ones at the <trunc>t</trunc>top ten unis cost <unclear>like</unclear> eight or nine <unclear>pretty much</unclear></u>
<u n="160" who="S0198" trans="overlap">are gonna be charging like eight or nine I can sort of appreciate <trunc>s</trunc> you know I mean the cost is ridiculous regardless but I can sort of understand it slightly more for things that do require lab work and stuff but linguistics? I mean I guess if you're willing to cover costs of fieldwork but erm masters like <anon type="place"/> putting it up to eight thousand</u>
<u n="161" who="S0192">I think they did that because they knew they were jumping up the league tables</u>
<u n="162" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0192">this year</u>
<u n="164" who="S0198">I mean it is a bloody good place can <trunc>y</trunc> ah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0192">they've gone up quite a bit</u>
<u n="166" who="S0198">I feel like people speak better at <anon type="place"/> could you imagine going somewhere <unclear>like</unclear> really high up? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="167" who="S0192"><unclear>well yeah</unclear> I think <anon type="place"/> is probably high enough for us</u>
<u n="168" who="S0198">it's probably a good choice for our niche</u>
<u n="169" who="S0192">you could try and go to an even better uni for your PhD</u>
<u n="170" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="171" who="S0192">because you're not really doing that much contact <unclear>hours</unclear> and by that point you've got a erm I mean effectively you could go from a top seventy uni to a top thirty top twenty uni depending on where you left it</u>
<u n="172" who="S0198">how do you <unclear>fall</unclear> into doing your PhD <unclear>straight from</unclear> your masters?</u>
<u n="173" who="S0192" trans="overlap">to a top ten well you effectively just carry on your research I reckon</u>
<u n="174" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="175" who="S0192">if you've got a good idea for your masters</u>
<u n="176" who="S0198" trans="overlap">start in our field</u>
<u n="177" who="S0192">quite often people turn their masters into PhDs</u>
<u n="178" who="S0198" trans="overlap">turn into PhDs continue that</u>
<u n="179" who="S0192">yeah effectively</u>
<u n="180" who="S0198">I did wonder at undergrad if I could turn my if you were allowed to turn your dissertation into a masters but I had a <trunc>f</trunc> your masters dissertation but no I don't think you can</u>
<u n="181" who="S0192"><unclear>really</unclear>?</u>
<u n="182" who="S0198">cos you've already got half the word count or all of the word count depending on</u>
<u n="183" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0198">the size of your dissertation</u>
<u n="185" who="S0192">it doesn't make any sense does it? and you you've er your dissertation's gonna have to be based on what you're taught you know</u>
<u n="186" who="S0198">I've got a feeling that in history I thought that the dissertations were ten twenty thousand a masters not ten not fifteen or ten</u>
<u n="187" who="S0192">erm they may well be</u>
<u n="188" who="S0198">they may be weighted to such a point that you are just because it's history you're</u>
<u n="189" who="S0192">because you're not doing field research</u>
<u n="190" who="S0198">you're <trunc>doi</trunc> yeah I mean you're doing what what else are they gonna be setting you throughout that masters other than to er <trunc>t</trunc>to? <unclear/> to prove</u>
<u n="191" who="S0192" trans="overlap">write a big piece of work</u>
<u n="192" who="S0198">that you can yeah</u>
<u n="193" who="S0192"><unclear/></u>
<u n="194" who="S0198">whereas in linguistics you're <unclear/></u>
<u n="195" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I mean the TEFL one is fifteen thousand</u>
<u n="196" who="S0198">yeah it is</u>
<u n="197" who="S0192">the ELT one is longer but I guess their field research is lower I mean they might not even have to do field research</u>
<u n="198" who="S0198" trans="overlap">I don't know it depends on er</u>
<u n="199" who="S0192">they er they might just be writing a long-assed paper on second language acquisition <unclear/></u>
<u n="200" who="S0198" trans="overlap"><unclear>well</unclear> they might have to do <vocal desc="yawn"/> <unclear>a like</unclear> case study</u>
<u n="201" who="S0192">but it's harder for them</u>
<u n="202" who="S0198"><unclear>she</unclear> did say in erm</u>
<u n="203" who="S0192">because they have to observe classes if they're doing it just based on TEFL</u>
<u n="204" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah but he did say in that opening thing that they have students there to be observed like</u>
<u n="205" who="S0192">yep</u>
<u n="206" who="S0198">you they have a language department that you can use</u>
<u n="207" who="S0192">yep but how much is each person gonna be observing? I don't reckon they probably have to do more than like five observation hours or something like that</u>
<u n="208" who="S0198"><unclear/> yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="209" who="S0192">do you know what I mean? and then it's all set up for them they just go and sit in a class and it's all ready to go and then just observe it whereas we have to come up with an idea which can be a complete scope of absolutely anything they're not gonna be out there doing research on the public about dialects and stuff in ELT</u>
<u n="210" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="211" who="S0192">it's got nothing to do with teaching English</u>
<u n="212" who="S0198" trans="overlap"><unclear>yeah no</unclear></u>
<u n="213" who="S0192">erm so therefore their their process of research is already set up yes they probably have to decide what they're observing in the class but the class is already there so they don't actually have to set it up so I reckon our research proposal what we actually research is harder</u>
<u n="214" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="215" who="S0192">what we have to come up with</u>
<u n="216" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="217" who="S0192">and therefore we write less words</u>
<u n="218" who="S0198">I'm er concerned as well I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> slightly touched on it yesterday I'm sure he did about erm I don't know if it's when we were just talking to him but that you I feel like with language variation the big project that's due in after Christmas you choose what it is that you're you're researching you choose an area cos I said I said</u>
<u n="219" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah he said something about</u>
<u n="220" who="S0198">language variation has got a huge scope and er blah blah blah and he said well that's why we cover these different points so that you can find the area that you wanna research</u>
<u n="221" who="S0192">yeah do you have to do some kind of project <unclear>or something</unclear>?</u>
<u n="222" who="S0198">yeah well there's a five thousand word essay and</u>
<u n="223" who="S0192">what's that on?</u>
<u n="224" who="S0198">and the er there there's only two assignments in language variation a literary <trunc>r</trunc> literary literature review and er the essay so I assume you choose something do a literature <vocal desc="laugh"/> review and then produce the essay for it so basically it's a mini dissertation</u>
<u n="225" who="S0192"><unclear/></u>
<u n="226" who="S0198">so in total <trunc>th</trunc>that's like</u>
<u n="227" who="S0192" trans="overlap">nice though cos you'll be nice and prepared for dissertations won't you?</u>
<u n="228" who="S0198">well in the <trunc>f</trunc> yeah I suppose by that point I've would've practised but</u>
<u n="229" who="S0192" trans="overlap">this is why for me</u>
<u n="230" who="S0198">I'd imagine it's in a different area</u>
<u n="231" who="S0192">I'd quite like to do first language acquisition but now I think about it more for the chances of what I'm gonna be doing a dissertation on first language acquisition isn't actually that useful</u>
<u n="232" who="S0198">that useful</u>
<u n="233" who="S0192">erm whereas discourse analysis is</u>
<u n="234" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="235" who="S0192">world Englishes is</u>
<u n="236" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="237" who="S0192">if I want to do er especially if I wanna focus on anything to do with our recordings</u>
<u n="238" who="S0198" trans="overlap">how many can we choose? so we've got fifteen is it the same amount? oh no dissertations how much is that? thirty?</u>
<u n="239" who="S0192">erm thirty</u>
<u n="240" who="S0198">oh does that come in the summer term <unclear>though</unclear>?</u>
<u n="241" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="242" who="S0198">so it doesn't count towards our spring term credits</u>
<u n="243" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="244" who="S0198">so we still need seventy-five</u>
<u n="245" who="S0192">yeah well in the spring term we still do another core module</u>
<u n="246" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="247" who="S0192">which is like the one that we're doing now research in language and use</u>
<u n="248" who="S0198"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="249" who="S0192">but erm where is it?</u>
<u n="250" who="S0198">probably <unclear/> in here somewhere</u>
<u n="251" who="S0192">oh you have a <trunc>ho</trunc> oh no it was hole-punched</u>
<u n="252" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="253" who="S0192">let's have a look</u>
<u n="254" who="S0198">so world Englishes is just fifteen credits so <unclear/></u>
<u n="255" who="S0192">yeah so</u>
<u n="256" who="S0198">so you could yeah <unclear><trunc>b</trunc> like</unclear> balance it out with something here</u>
<u n="257" who="S0192" trans="overlap">with another one of this I'd be</u>
<u n="258" who="S0198">like semantics or phrenology perhaps would you do that?</u>
<u n="259" who="S0192">erm I'd probably go for phrenology rather than semantics</u>
<u n="260" who="S0198" trans="overlap">to complement <trunc>s</trunc> yeah to complement cos then you'd have the you would've covered the syntax</u>
<u n="261" who="S0192">if yeah if I could do <trunc>phrenolo</trunc> yeah I mean I've got the core I'd like to be kind of what she is a little bit</u>
<u n="262" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="263" who="S0192"><unclear/> like I speak grammar</u>
<u n="264" who="S0198"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear>yeah</unclear></u>
<u n="265" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="266" who="S0198">I see yeah</u>
<u n="267" who="S0192">well</u>
<u n="268" who="S0198">see I think I'm <trunc>prob</trunc> I'm probably more</u>
<u n="269" who="S0192" trans="overlap"><unclear/> know quite a bit about grammar</u>
<u n="270" who="S0198">like perhaps <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="271" who="S0192">history psychology based</u>
<u n="272" who="S0198">depends he seems more like he <trunc>c</trunc> he could've you know could've just done a degree in history</u>
<u n="273" who="S0192">I mean it's a field that you can do that in</u>
<u n="274" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="275" who="S0192">so it's alright but</u>
<u n="276" who="S0198">which is why I don't know whether er</u>
<u n="277" who="S0192">first language acquisition interests me I find it quite fascinating what children do and how they learn languages and that may go very well with your second language acquisition</u>
<u n="278" who="S0198">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="279" who="S0192"><unclear/> discourse and communication analysis I'm a little bit concerned she's nice but</u>
<u n="280" who="S0198">she won't take any shit I don't think</u>
<u n="281" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I reckon she's yeah I reckon she's she's very strict</u>
<u n="282" who="S0198">and I think she'll be quite direct with you</u>
<u n="283" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="284" who="S0198">that's the thing I got about er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> also he er I'm pretty sure he he'll just he won't he he won't like faff about</u>
<u n="285" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="286" who="S0198">he'll directly ask you just out of hand</u>
<u n="287" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but he might yeah I mean he might have well if they do run like <trunc>s</trunc> er <anon type="place"/> certificates</u>
<u n="288" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="289" who="S0192">and they know about CELTAs and DELTAs they've probably got more of that methodology with their</u>
<u n="290" who="S0198">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="291" who="S0192">their way of teaching</u>
<u n="292" who="S0198">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="293" who="S0192">whereas <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s just <trunc>f</trunc> hasn't really taught so he's just gonna be like</u>
<u n="294" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="295" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/> you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="296" who="S0198">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="297" who="S0192">so it's not a bad thing they might actually be better teachers for it but</u>
<u n="298" who="S0198">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="299" who="S0192">erm it will probably be harder but discourse and communication analysis if that is actually about you know like things that you've recorded and then analysing it that's gonna be <unclear>bloody</unclear> useful</u>
<u n="300" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah yeah it would be pretty useful</u>
<u n="301" who="S0192">and would go well with phrenology and probably world Englishes so at the minute I'm leaning on that</u>
<u n="302" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="303" who="S0192">but then that means I have to do four modules again which means I've come out and done quite a few modules if I come out with the degree that I've done</u>
<u n="304" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah well unless I <unclear>don't <trunc>th</trunc></unclear> unless we unless you just choose those two core modules then that's just er a lot of people are gonna be in that position I think</u>
<u n="305" who="S0192">mm but I mean some I mean er <trunc>s</trunc> by the sounds of things people were just choosing the the main modules weren't they?</u>
<u n="306" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="307" who="S0192">I mean what did she say she was doing? I mean if she was doing forensic <trunc>s</trunc> linguistics and the discourse <unclear/> so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was doing these two was she?</u>
<u n="308" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="309" who="S0192">so she's doing four</u>
<u n="310" who="S0198">yeah she is she's <unclear/></u>
<u n="311" who="S0192">so it must be fairly common but I mean if I do another four I'll've come out with eight modules that's quite a few</u>
<u n="312" who="S0198"><vocal desc="yawn"/> <unclear/> I don't know what <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s doing</u>
<u n="313" who="S0192" trans="overlap">plus the MA dissertation is another thirty well they run pidgins and creoles again</u>
<u n="314" who="S0198">yeah they do</u>
<u n="315" who="S0192">I mean you could do quite well in that if I've already fucking done it</u>
<u n="316" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/> like you could do really well in it how would they argue that we've plagiarised or not? you were here while I studied it and therefore learnt about it yourself and now you've taken a course in it I mean there's nothing wrong with if you already know Spanish you can take a certificate in Spanish that gives you a qualification in Spanish</u>
<u n="318" who="S0198">no yeah that's true</u>
<u n="319" who="S0192">so if you already know pidgins and creoles you can take a qualification in it</u>
<u n="320" who="S0198" trans="overlap">but I <trunc>ha</trunc> I don't know <trunc>pidg</trunc> I haven't actually been</u>
<u n="321" who="S0192">no but by the end of this semester</u>
<u n="322" who="S0198">studying with you</u>
<u n="323" who="S0192">I will be telling you about it</u>
<u n="324" who="S0198">yeah you could certainly <unclear/> help explain things for me</u>
<u n="325" who="S0192">so I mean you could do pidgins and creoles and come out they might be like oh cheeky but</u>
<u n="326" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="327" who="S0192">but you could come out with quite a good grade <unclear/></u>
<u n="328" who="S0198">I think it depends how language variation goes for me and second language acquisition depends on what I'll choose next semester</u>
<u n="329" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="330" who="S0198">I don't when I'll we have to make these decisions if for example <trunc>lang</trunc>language variation's particularly successful then I might choose language <unclear>and gender</unclear> even though it never initially appealed to me I can it might be something <unclear/> semantics perhaps</u>
<u n="331" who="S0192">mm so what do we have to do? research proposal?</u>
<u n="332" who="S0198" trans="overlap">I wouldn't mind semantics discourse <trunc>w</trunc></u>
<u n="333" who="S0192">semantics was quite tricky I think they said</u>
<u n="334" who="S0198">ah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0192">and it's very perceptive</u>
<u n="336" who="S0198">yeah well that's why <unclear>I yeah</unclear></u>
<u n="337" who="S0192">research proposal this module will provide specific guidance for your dissertation to help you in the choice of a research topic type of research project and appropriate methodology will work in conjunction with the presentations given by the English language and linguistics staff during the year</u>
<u n="338" who="S0198">yeah that's exactly it yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0192">ah</u>
<u n="340" who="S0198"><unclear/></u>
<u n="341" who="S0192">it will also be so this has got some direct link into those things <unclear/> <unclear>enrolled</unclear></u>
<u n="342" who="S0198" trans="overlap">and will work in conjunction</u>
<u n="343" who="S0192"><unclear>oh</unclear> we've got those the whole year then pretty much</u>
<u n="344" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="345" who="S0192">it's just part of the course <unclear>man</unclear> they work you</u>

<u n="348" who="S0198">we're gonna be busy <unclear/></u>
<u n="349" who="S0192">yeah basically we just have to just do this all the time</u>
<u n="350" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="351" who="S0192">I mean <vocal desc="sigh"/> friends have to understand that</u>

<u n="353" who="S0192" trans="overlap">if can your your friends can like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> imagine doing all that work she did for her MA in one year?</u>
<u n="354" who="S0198">yeah</u>

<u n="356" who="S0198">yeah</u>

<u n="383" who="S0192">I can't wait until we can teach modules and like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you know you focus on something she's like right I do the syntactics and pidgins and creole modules that's all she does on here <unclear>and</unclear> she must do some other undergraduate modules</u>
<u n="384" who="S0198">yeah yeah they do</u>

<u n="386" who="S0198" trans="overlap">she does <trunc>Eng</trunc> she does</u>

<u n="388" who="S0198">English language</u>
<u n="389" who="S0192">I'm I like to be organised this kind of thing would be perfect if I could lay out at the beginning and go right student</u>

<u n="1319" who="S0198">I think it depends I think it depends a lot on the schools and your co-teachers how that can be affected as well</u>
<u n="1320" who="S0192">as a guy I did have a certain amount of power over my female co-teachers</u>

<u n="1329" who="S0198">no yeah</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0192">cos rumours will start spreading er they don't want that kind of stuff so I had to the point where co-teachers aren't even talking to me coming to me <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know what I mean?</u>
