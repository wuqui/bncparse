<u n="11" who="S0417">okay</u>
<u n="12" who="S0415">what? <pause dur="short"/> what are you pointing at?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0417">nothing</u>
<u n="14" who="S0415">ah no <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/> that's what she told me like</u>
<u n="15" who="S0417"><unclear/> <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0415"><unclear/></u>
<u n="17" who="S0417"><unclear/></u>
<u n="18" who="S0415"><unclear/> no</u>
<u n="19" who="S0417"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> but you okay yeah but you are you? are you asking people which things most suits you? then that that's hard to get a kind of level <pause dur="short"/> I don't know I've never understood</u>
<u n="20" who="S0415">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing as well is that they're they give the survey to a hundred people to design with a hundred different surveys you know? there's no right or wrong there can be better practised ones but <pause dur="short"/> did you get a knife and fork <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="21" who="S0416" trans="overlap"><unclear/> no I'll go <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> thank you</u>
<u n="22" who="S0417">well that's why I tried <unclear/> gave you the survey erm the ones that I found because <pause dur="short"/> they're the ones that few people have tried to set up on their own giving it to quite a few organisation one of them was the EESB</u>
<u n="23" who="S0415">ESB?</u>
<u n="24" who="S0417">is it ESB? in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0415">well it is it would be yeah the electricity supply board</u>

<u n="33" who="S0415">the presidential age do you know what that? there's two referendums</u>
<u n="34" who="S0417" trans="overlap">yeah it's from <trunc>tw</trunc> thirty-five to twenty-one</u>
<u n="35" who="S0415">yeah I'm disappointed in that because people just refuse to see the fundamental point it's not about making someone who's twenty-one the president it's about an equality thing making <trunc>su</trunc> making their eligible to run like even though they can't run anyway cos it's all controlled politically it's kind of like saying well actually you know cos if a twenty-year-old twenty-one-year-old for some reason did manage to get on the ballot paper if the country then decided that he's too young to be president that's fine but you can't it's kind of like</u>
<u n="36" who="S0417" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0415">oh no you don't get the opportunity cos <unclear/> might be some very inspirational twenty-five-year-old who'd done great work all over the world charities or</u>

<u n="58" who="S0417" trans="overlap">well they want a natural conversation natural conversation talking about being recorded is not natural <pause dur="short"/></u>

<u n="521" who="S0415"><trunc>ti</trunc>tiname</u>
<u n="522" who="S0416"><unclear/></u>
<u n="523" who="S0417">you know if you think about it it's probably the simplest way we can do it if you wanted to say E but in a different the way E is spelt</u>
<u n="524" who="S0415" trans="overlap">aha why don't they just put E?</u>
<u n="525" who="S0417">no but there might be two there's two different things of E so one is upside down</u>

<u n="534" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="535" who="S0415">antinomy is actually just <pause dur="short"/> if you flick the M and the N the M and the N you get <trunc>antin</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> antimony which is actually an element</u>
<u n="536" who="S0417">oh right</u>
<u n="537" who="S0415">so so antimony is an element but antinomy is the word which is exactly the kind of word <unclear/> title because it's a contradiction between two beliefs and conclusions that are themselves reasonable</u>

<u n="565" who="S0415">between eighteen hundred and two-thousand and eight from the corpus English remember the argument we having yesterday <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="566" who="S0417" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="567" who="S0415">about the corpus now it's like suddenly never heard of that word in that context and now in the last twenty-four hours found it in two contexts</u>
<u n="568" who="S0417" trans="overlap">oh yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="569" who="S0415">it's like <unclear/></u>
<u n="570" who="S0417"><unclear/> <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="571" who="S0415">but I wish they could show it to some <unclear/>rather than cos it actually gives you really really really really low percentages <unclear/> think there was like ten thousandths of a percentage <unclear/> which is annoying <pause dur="short"/> wanted to know as well whether it's used in all the capitals all the lower case or with capital <unclear/> that's just mad crap</u>
<u n="572" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="573" who="S0415">course all they did was scan a whole load of books and then <unclear/> they didn't do any of this work anyway <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/> good</u>
<u n="574" who="S0417" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="misc"/> yeah it's as much as how much it been mentioned in papers</u>

<u n="580" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="581" who="S0415">all those classics were published by all publishers because they're classics and out of copyright and this copyright thing is insidious cos the Americans were lunatics keep adding on years on copyright so like in terms of music like in other countries like it's the life of the artist plus whatever five years whatever it is but in in America corporations keep getting little legislators to add on years so like nothing has come out of copyright into common use so like even in America now like it's two thousand and fifteen now they the most modern music you can use out of copyright is something like nineteen twenty-eight</u>
<u n="582" who="S0417">oh</u>
<u n="583" who="S0415">and like or nineteen twenty there's a new block coming out this year like it's that far behind which is ridiculous considering</u>
