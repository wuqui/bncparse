<u n="38" who="S0256">yeah no I didn't get didn't go outside much today I went out erm for a wander on my lunch and obviously then <pause dur="short"/> when I walked back to my car because I wasn't feeling great so I just couldn't tell if I was warm or not so I kept my hoodie on</u>
<u n="39" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0256">so I <vocal desc="laugh"/> I must have looked a bit strange walking round in in a big hoodie and everyone's walking around in like T-shirts <vocal desc="laugh"/> cos I just couldn't <trunc>ev</trunc> I well I didn't warm up quick enough and I was like I'm fine I'm just going to stay snuggled up in my hoodie</u>

<u n="49" who="S0255">ice skating <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="50" who="S0256">yeah I think that would count as strenuous activity and exercise</u>

<u n="64" who="S0256">so</u>
<u n="65" who="S0255">so will you be alright tomorrow? is will that be a long a <trunc>l</trunc> enough time in the morning?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0256">yeah yeah yeah he says like on the day</u>
<u n="67" who="S0255">oh that's alright then</u>
<u n="68" who="S0256">in fact</u>
<u n="69" who="S0255">well I think that was that was really good though <trunc>g</trunc> ringing and going and getting him to check it</u>
<u n="70" who="S0256" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0255">your tooth</u>
<u n="72" who="S0256">yeah I'm glad I did because it's a lot better now <pause dur="short"/> but I know it must have been bad for me to say yeah I'm gonna go and get it checked I think <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's it's good <pause dur="short"/> I'm happy it's out now <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="73" who="S0255">so do you feel less wise now you have less wisdom teeth?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0256">no <vocal desc="laugh"/> one tooth's fine</u>
<u n="75" who="S0255"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="76" who="S0256">I always say a secret genius in the making so <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0255">you <trunc>s</trunc> you say you say what?</u>
<u n="78" who="S0256">I say <vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm a secret genius</u>
<u n="79" who="S0255">oh right <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="80" who="S0256">erm no it's good though it still feels weird</u>
<u n="81" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0256">cos <unclear>so</unclear> so having a tooth there now that it's it's strange that it's gone but</u>
<u n="83" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0256">I'm glad it is it's so much more comfortable I can actually feel I've come back to me</u>
<u n="85" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0256">that's nice</u>
<u n="87" who="S0255">so tell me what you do with the skating now</u>
<u n="88" who="S0256">erm well we've got the we'll be starting work on the Christmas so er show soon cos it's we normally know by October what we're doing and so we should know if they're talking about like Cinderella or Mary Poppins or Jungle Book or something like that but</u>
<u n="89" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0256">erm hopefully this year if it's a show it'll probably just be our lot so then we might get to do a bit more as well <pause dur="short"/> so that'll be nice erm just practising for my test at the minute though I'm waiting for my test date it shouldn't be long <unclear/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0255" trans="overlap">how how long roughly?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0256">I wouldn't say it would be that long like I think we'll know the date soon and then it just depends on when there's enough people to put in for a test cos they won't bring a <trunc>ju</trunc> a judge in if it's only like one or two people wanting to test they want to have like a full morning's worth of testing before they'll bring a judge</u>
<u n="93" who="S0255" trans="overlap">so they have to wait until they've got</u>
<u n="94" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0255" trans="overlap">enough people <pause dur="short"/> were there lots of people last time?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0256">there was a fair few yeah erm lots of people do a number of different tests so people do like their elements and their freestyle and their field moves on the same day <pause dur="short"/> so then it erm <pause dur="short"/> it just ends up being that the there's not necessarily that many people but there's enough people to do a number of different tests otherwise it's a waste of a judge's time to come in and a waste of the money</u>
<u n="97" who="S0255" trans="overlap">so what's are they in a particular order that <trunc>y</trunc> you have to do one lot then another then another or is it just you'll do</u>
<u n="98" who="S0256" trans="overlap">erm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0255" trans="overlap">different levels in each type?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0256">yeah you have different levels in each type so like it goes up to ten and then you have it in freestyle <pause dur="short"/> er so like the that's like your programme and you have elements which is like your jump spins things like that erm and then you have field moves which is showing off like the skills and the basics of skating to show that you can do footwork and things and then you've also of course you've got dance and they all go up to ten so I've got my field moves level one I've passed and my free level one I've passed and I'm working on my field moves level two my free level two and I'm working on my elements level one and two so that I can put in for them</u>
<u n="101" who="S0255" trans="overlap">so when?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0256" trans="overlap">once I've done level one</u>
<u n="103" who="S0255">when you do the test thing then can when they come to test you could you be doing two or three different things is that what you normally do?</u>
<u n="104" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah you well you can either do it depends really what you've got ready for testing er my level twos aren't quite ready for testing yet so I'm not putting them in but I could very easily do level one and two in in in elements while I'm doing my level two and three and my level two in field moves but they're</u>
<u n="105" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0256">not quite polished enough yet that we're ready to put them in they're nearly there with some of them but there's just bits where they're not quite ready like my my sit spin isn't quite low enough</u>
<u n="107" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="108" who="S0256">so then it's not ready to be tested</u>
<u n="109" who="S0255">oh that's alright</u>
<u n="110" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0255">so like what was the last show that you did with the ice skating? I'm trying to remember</u>
<u n="112" who="S0256">that was the gala</u>
<u n="113" who="S0255">oh that's right yeah so that was all just loads of different bits</u>
<u n="114" who="S0256">yeah it it was rubbish really and I'm glad that we're not doing that this year we're doing an actual show this year</u>
<u n="115" who="S0255">I think the last show was that the like The Lion King?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0256">The Lion King yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0255">that was really good</u>
<u n="118" who="S0256">or the er African Adventure as it was formerly known <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="119" who="S0255" trans="overlap">well yeah yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0256">yeah no it I think the problem was because we did a gala the the other groups like the <anon type="miscPersonalInfo"/> joined it because they could just put stuff in that they were putting in the <anon type="place"/> gala</u>
<u n="121" who="S0255">yeah so they it isn't really</u>
<u n="122" who="S0256" trans="overlap">so they weren't great so there was more people that and more coaches involved so it meant that there wasn't it wasn't the same as when it's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>  and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like <trunc>ru</trunc>running it it's not quite the same it as as that but this year if there's a show</u>
<u n="123" who="S0255" trans="overlap">then you'll get the continuity and they'd know how to bring the best out in everybody rather than</u>
<u n="124" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="125" who="S0255">lots of people having an input</u>
<u n="126" who="S0256" trans="overlap">and it's controlled</u>
<u n="127" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0256" trans="overlap">like last year with our group the we ended up being given cast offs from <trunc>ano</trunc>another group</u>
<u n="129" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0256">that were a lot lower level than us and we had to like dumb the whole routine down for them which meant that those of us that were higher levels weren't getting to do anything or show off anything and it also meant we didn't have enough time</u>
<u n="131" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0256">to do what the coaches wanted to do but if it's a if it's a show like with here <anon type="miscPersonalInfo"/> won't because they've got the <anon type="place"/> gala that they do every year so if that's on they won't do the show</u>
<u n="133" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0256">because they <trunc>do</trunc> it's too much of a commitment with just starting</u>
<u n="135" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0256">it just means it'll be the <anon type="place"/> Skate Academy lot so like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s lot that'll do it and and it'll be a lot more availability and we'll have to do more</u>
<u n="137" who="S0255">well that's good because like even if you're in a group and a lot of the stuff you're having to do isn't at that high standard you should be able to hopefully do two or three or little bits yourself</u>
<u n="138" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0255">to go off and actually do a little bit more</u>
<u n="140" who="S0256" trans="overlap">well some of the people that were in the groups like the top two circles</u>
<u n="141" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="142" who="S0256">are at the same level as me which is fine</u>
<u n="143" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0256">and have a good work <trunc>eth</trunc>ethic as well because it's the problem is you get the ones that just muck around and don't wanna do it</u>
<u n="145" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="146" who="S0256">you get the ones where they're learning the basic the most basic of moves that we've all been doing for years</u>
<u n="147" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0256" trans="overlap">and then it's they don't know how to do it and you that's when you can see there's gonna be a problem because you can't put anything too complicated in</u>
<u n="149" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="150" who="S0256">because they won't do it won't be able to do it and then those of us that are that are at the top of our group because we're sort of the in-between ones we're not quite we're almost at the level of the lower lot in the higher group but they're pushing to keep up with the top group whereas if you do a show the ones that <trunc>wer</trunc>were at the top of the top group</u>
<u n="151" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="152" who="S0256" trans="overlap">will be the main characters</u>
<u n="153" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0256">with some of the ones lower down being some of the main characters</u>
<u n="155" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0256">you'll then have the ones that almost at our level being at our sort of level and we could all be in a group together</u>
<u n="157" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="158" who="S0256">because they're closer to our level some of them are are trying doubles and just about landing axels but they're actually more comfortable doing the lower down jumps so then</u>
<u n="159" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="S0256">we'll all be around the same sort of level and a lot of people have said well not a lot but some people have said they're not doing it this year any more they're not sure if they're going to do it they might help out instead</u>
<u n="161" who="S0255">cos that's one good thing with you you can actually have the flexible time at work this year can't you?</u>
<u n="162" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah yeah at least I have</u>
<u n="163" who="S0255" trans="overlap">whereas before you'd really struggled didn't</u>
<u n="164" who="S0256" trans="overlap">and I've got the October half term off</u>
<u n="165" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0256" trans="overlap">which was a very</u>
<u n="167" who="S0255">er</u>
<u n="168" who="S0256">clever plot of mine because usually we have extra rehearsals in in October half term</u>
<u n="169" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0256" trans="overlap">and I can never make any of them</u>
<u n="171" who="S0255">no</u>
<u n="172" who="S0256">but it was free there was like one space across the week left and I was like I'm having that thank you very much</u>
<u n="173" who="S0255"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0256">so I've got that off so then even if we're not doing anything I can still go in and skate or do other things but if we have</u>
<u n="175" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0256">got it planned work that we'll be doing which we usually do</u>
<u n="177" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0256">I'll be able to commit to more rehearsals</u>
<u n="179" who="S0255">so what date's that roughly?</u>
<u n="180" who="S0256">er it's the week after my birthday</u>
<u n="181" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="182" who="S0256">so like the twenty-fifth of something I think it is something like that twenty-fifth twenty-sixth cos my birthday's on the Wednesday which I've got off and then it's <pause dur="short"/> yeah so it'll be about the twenty-sixth I think or twenty-seventh it's the end of October</u>
<u n="183" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0256" trans="overlap">so</u>
