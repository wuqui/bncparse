<u n="79" who="S0469">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> that was so random</u>
<u n="80" who="S0437"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I just I I literally think the entire premise of that film was she was never pregnant she just like was high as a kite</u>
<u n="81" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="82" who="S0469">it just that can't be</u>

<u n="88" who="S0469">why or how?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0438">I mean what do you think happened?</u>
<u n="90" who="S0437">I think it was meant to be like have you ever seen The Descent?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0438">mm mm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0437">it's erm it's a horror movie and it it's not bad it's alright but like they go underground and like do you mind if I give away the last scene?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0438">mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0437">erm basically she has been trying to get out of this place like they're right right right underground and they've been trying to find the way out and she's the only one left alive and there's are all these like weird like humanoid things that have been living down there so long they've just evolved into cannibalistic like creepy things and erm the end scene is her like finally like finding like finding a crack where there's daylight and like</u>
<u n="95" who="S0438">mm mm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0437">rubbing the stones away and like getting out and then erm she wakes up and she's still in the pit</u>

<u n="99" who="S0469" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="100" who="S0437">hallucinated getting out because I can't remember why you hallucinate down there but you start hallucinating I think maybe because of the oxygen or something but erm and it felt a bit like that you know that where there was like can you hear me Dora?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0469"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0438"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="103" who="S0437">like that I think that was like the recurring</u>
<u n="104" who="S0438">oh horror film</u>
<u n="105" who="S0437">because it was filmed really trippy which was why I genuinely I'm not sure if she was pregnant cos I think it would have been quite a good twist if she was never pregnant just like hacked herself open and woke up in hospital erm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0469" trans="overlap">mm hacked herself</u>
<u n="107" who="S0438" trans="overlap">mm</u>
