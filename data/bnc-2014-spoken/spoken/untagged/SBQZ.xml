<u n="687" who="S0388" trans="overlap">that's yeah that's right</u>
<u n="688" who="S0262">but it really makes me think that if you are on these shows in these shows <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>I</trunc> you are <pause dur="short"/> everything you're doing is being watched</u>
<u n="689" who="S0388" trans="overlap">well they say for The Only Way Is Essex most of it is true but they set up scenarios that are for your entertainment</u>

<u n="697" who="S0388" trans="overlap">awful really</u>
<u n="698" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it's well but part of it's compelling because if you think about it it's based on theatre</u>
<u n="699" who="S0388">yeah</u>
<u n="700" who="S0262">as in all these different characters</u>
<u n="701" who="S0388">yes</u>
