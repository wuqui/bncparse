<u n="1" who="S0486">hello <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> right you're going to talk about your childhood experiences today <pause dur="short"/> what would you say <pause dur="short"/> really stands out to you <pause dur="short"/> when you look back on that on those times?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0507">one of my earliest experiences when I was about <pause dur="short"/> two years old <pause dur="short"/> and my brother <pause dur="short"/> was taken very poorly with appendicitis and was rushed into hospital <pause dur="short"/> and because in those days there were no antibiotics <pause dur="short"/> he went on to get <pause dur="short"/> septicaemia <pause dur="short"/> and I can remember my father taking me down to the local hospital to see him <pause dur="short"/> I wasn't allowed in but I could look at him through the window because children were not allowed in the hospital at that time <pause dur="short"/> when he was due to come home <pause dur="short"/> then we went down with father to collect him <pause dur="short"/> and not having a car at that time we collected him in a taxi and brought him home <pause dur="short"/> and it was just lovely to have him back home after so many months not having him around it felt so good at that time <pause dur="short"/> one of my next experiences would be I suppose about when I was about three or four <pause dur="short"/> my grandmother lived with us <pause dur="short"/> and she had a lovely bedroom with pictures all around the walls erm some which had texts from the Bible and pictures and a lovely big double bed with a feather mattress <pause dur="short"/> and I used to love to go into her <pause dur="short"/> feather mattress bed and snuggle up beside her <pause dur="short"/> and she would tell me stories <pause dur="short"/> and I knew the stories well because she would say well which story do you want today? and I would say oh this one please nana and she would say <pause dur="short"/> oh you've heard that one before and I would say oh yes I know but I want to hear it again so that was erm <pause dur="short"/> one of my earliest memories <pause dur="short"/> I suppose erm I was only two when war broke out so there were many memories as war <pause dur="short"/> took hold <pause dur="short"/> and I think my father was called up when <pause dur="short"/> I was just <pause dur="short"/> three and a half <pause dur="short"/> to go with his call up papers and I can remember the call up papers I didn't know they were that but being put through the letterbox <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> having great distress in the family with my mother crying and nana upset er because father had got to go and leave the family home and go to serve in the forces <pause dur="short"/> so that's another sort of thing that I really stands out in my memory as a little young child that that took place <pause dur="short"/> and obviously in time erm then he had to go and we were on our own we had quite a big house and because we had a big house <pause dur="short"/> we were <pause dur="short"/> obliged to have <pause dur="short"/> lodgers <pause dur="short"/> we weren't allowed to have any free rooms where <pause dur="short"/> they were free and no one slept in them so we had quite a series of lodgers coming in to the family home which was quite a strange feeling really erm to have strangers among us but my mother and grandmother being such good cooks I think they all thought they were onto a good place for staying and we certainly made them as comfortable as we possibly could <pause dur="short"/> as a child <pause dur="short"/> I remember during the war because <pause dur="short"/> we might be in a location where bombs might drop <pause dur="short"/> we had what they would call in those days not an outside shelter we had to go into but my erm mother and grandmother we had a big <pause dur="short"/> like erm an iron <pause dur="short"/> shelter cage in which my brother and myself were made to sleep <pause dur="short"/> erm just us two children <pause dur="short"/> and we were shut in there during the night and I slept at one end and my brother slept at the other end and he always used to make a fuss I remember about oh he didn't like little sister's feet poking in him erm</u>
<u n="3" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="4" who="S0507"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and erm I used to probably make a bit of a fuss about this and we there we were both in this cage erm <pause dur="short"/> I I remember that vividly and <pause dur="short"/> because <pause dur="short"/> er mother was a bit sort of anxious about us erm she also had a bed in that room <pause dur="short"/> and I remember one time when father came home on a very short leave before he was going to France erm it was over a Christmas period <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> at the morning when we were let out erm we used to love to come and romp on the bed erm mother would be up but father was you know it's so lovely to have him back he would play erm <pause dur="short"/> well games with us and we would do things like head over the heels and <trunc>si</trunc> you know funny things like that well least I did as a girl <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> on one occasion it created great panic on the Boxing Day <pause dur="short"/> because I did a head over heels so far that I went over the end of the bed</u>
<u n="5" who="S0486">oh</u>
<u n="6" who="S0507">and I hit my head on the corner of the iron shelter</u>
<u n="7" who="S0486">oh</u>
<u n="8" who="S0507">and <pause dur="short"/> I obviously knocked myself out <pause dur="short"/> and when I came to I <trunc>lef</trunc> let out the most horrendous shrieking and crying they'd ever heard in the household</u>
<u n="9" who="S0486" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="10" who="S0507">and there was great panic stations with me because Boxing Day my head bleeding and oh dear it was I was in a state and so were they <vocal desc="laugh"/> so anyway it was decided I had to be taken down to the local hospital erm which was quite a little distance away <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> how were we to get there? because as I said earlier we had no car at that time and obviously buses were not running and there didn't seem to be taxis about at that stage I don't know <pause dur="short"/> but anyway the next door neighbours to us they had erm children too of a much younger age and they had a little pushchair <pause dur="short"/> and so the pushchair was borrowed from next door and I was wheeled down to the <pause dur="short"/> accident and emergency I suppose department erm it wasn't called that in those days but the equivalent as that today er and there erm my head was shaved at the back and I erm <pause dur="short"/> wound cleaned and then I had a little row of stitches put in <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> I suppose I was erm you know told I was a good girl and erm <pause dur="short"/> I'd been very brave erm and then they were I was brought home and then we had you know some treats erm <pause dur="short"/> and I was made a great fuss of which was <trunc>rath</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> which was rather nice but I it's something I always remember in my childhood so that's another memory that really stands out vividly for me <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> later on in the war my father when he was in France had quite a bad accident <pause dur="short"/> and he had to be brought back home to <pause dur="short"/> erm this country our own country to go into a military hospital he had erm as I called it in those days erm broken his spine</u>
<u n="11" who="S0486">oh</u>
<u n="12" who="S0507">and he was erm <pause dur="short"/> very poorly for a long while and in fact my mother said he was never the same man again erm really for the rest of his life <pause dur="short"/> but as he progressed and he was allowed out in due course of hospital they <trunc>h</trunc> were given erm a blue uniform so that people would know that they were not people who were not willing to fight but that they were soldiers and they were <pause dur="short"/> invalided out of the forces and they were given this blue uniform and he came home and I can remember erm <pause dur="short"/> mother went to get him and I was with granny and then we went to meet them coming off the bus not far from really a large park we had near us and I remember my parents walking arm in arm erm <pause dur="short"/> so lovely and I was skipping along in front of them and <pause dur="short"/> to come back home they were coming home and it was just such a joyous moment I remember that skipping through the park <trunc>w</trunc> as we you know came home again so that was another lovely little memory <pause dur="short"/> erm school days erm <pause dur="short"/> it was still the war when I went to school and started my primary school we had our own little classroom and playground separate from the erm <pause dur="short"/> larger children I suppose who'd moved on and been there a year <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> we had milk at break times <pause dur="short"/> and it was we had to take our own mugs to have it in and I think we used to have like little enamel mugs and erm <pause dur="short"/> milk was dolloped out from a milk churn for us <pause dur="short"/> and in the bitter cold winter weather we got on the east side of the country er drinking this cold milk which I was not very keen on at all erm from this churn erm <vocal desc="laugh"/> is another memory I have erm <pause dur="short"/> later on I suppose <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I had a change of school because <pause dur="short"/> we had er a bomb drop at the end of our road and this is still doing when my father was in the forces and we were evacuated <trunc>w</trunc> my brother and myself with my mother erm up to stay with an aunt and uncle in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> and my cousin lived there so there were two boys and just me as a little girl and the two boys well they were <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> probably a bit of nuisance to erm erm aunt and uncle and my mother because they were always up to games and tricks and erm what have you <pause dur="short"/> but I went to a little school I remember it was quite a hilly area and I went to the <trunc>s</trunc> taken to the local children you know where the children went to school in the young classes <pause dur="short"/> and one of the things we did <pause dur="short"/> erm was to be taught knitting <pause dur="short"/> er I was not <pause dur="short"/> terribly keen on this class because although I could I was taught to knit I kept dropping stitches and getting into awful trouble because <pause dur="short"/> oh dear <pause dur="short"/> I'd lost a stitch again <vocal desc="laugh"/> and bringing it home and erm mother and aunt sorting me out with the knitting and back I would go and the school had a long corridor where we had to leave our little coats <pause dur="short"/> and there were cubbyholes erm <pause dur="short"/> opposite your classroom <pause dur="short"/> where you hung your coats erm and put your wellington boots and things like that and then you went into your classroom opposite <pause dur="short"/> but the trouble was all these little <pause dur="short"/> cubbyhole places all looked the same to me I couldn't quite make out where my coat should go which classroom I should go into and I think after about six months of coping with all this erm I said to my mum mummy can we please please go home again I don't like this school to which erm I'm going? so erm after a probably about another month six weeks we all trooped back again to erm to the home where erm grandmother still was and where the lodgers were and erm life continued on erm much until the end of the war so that's some of my memories of early childhood I suppose erm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0486">was?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0507" trans="overlap">that stand so vividly in my mind</u>
<u n="15" who="S0486">was there er <trunc>u</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc>any of the lodgers that you found interesting or quirky or? were were there anybody was there anybody there who stood out?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0507">erm yes I would say perhaps there were two that stood out erm one was a lady called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> erm she was and we kept friendly with her and one of the <pause dur="short"/> the gentlemen that came as well erm again over the years we kept in touch with <pause dur="short"/> and I think those two stand out really as</u>
<u n="17" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0507">being really nice people hard working and would help in the home as well as going out to work erm <pause dur="short"/> so they were really lovely others seemed to pass by in a bit of a a daze for me really <pause dur="short"/> er one thing I do remember with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> when I was a very well I was just a very little girl erm <pause dur="short"/> mother made me do something that I really hated doing <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm whether it was I don't think my brother did no he definitely didn't but I I had to do it erm she wanted the lodger <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> to see that I was all alright and there was nothing wrong with me erm <pause dur="short"/> and one day when I was due for my bath <pause dur="short"/> she made me come down just and <trunc>s</trunc>show her me with <trunc>n</trunc> just my skin with nothing else on me <vocal desc="laugh"/> at erm before I sort of round the towel round again to see that I was all you know clean and nice erm <pause dur="short"/> and I always remember hating <trunc>th</trunc> absolutely hating that erm <pause dur="short"/> but she was such a nice lady you know she <trunc>pro</trunc> they probably had a laugh erm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0486"><unclear>can?</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="20" who="S0507" trans="overlap">another little memory I have of childhood is <vocal desc="cough"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> when I was a little bit older I suppose I was <pause dur="short"/> perhaps eight or nine yes that was probably about the age I was I was very poorly for about three months and erm initially they thought I had mumps erm in fact the nurse came round and said that's what I'd got <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> I didn't get better <pause dur="short"/> at the end of what they thought the mumps spell should be my face was getting fatter and I was in a lot of pain and I seemed to be losing weight and it obviously wasn't mumps and I think it was my cervical glands had become terribly swollen <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I had a little bed down in the sitting room and I remember on one occasion erm because we had open fires coal fires we had erm the chimney sweep came <pause dur="short"/> and I <pause dur="short"/> begged mother I wanted to see the chimney sweep so erm <pause dur="short"/> amidst all the room being covered up with cloths and all around the fireplace erm protected with things <pause dur="short"/> and the sweep coming erm I was allowed to lie on my little bed with a sweep in the room <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="22" who="S0507">and and see <vocal desc="laugh"/> the brush <trunc>u</trunc> the brush going up and all the rods going up and obviously there was oh dear me erm <pause dur="short"/> you know it wasn't a very clean process at the end but anyway erm I was given this special permission to see the sweep which was very kind <pause dur="short"/> and erm I think in the end they probably thought my glands possibly had been TB and I was poorly probably from about <pause dur="short"/> oh I don't know four four five months erm I was off school <pause dur="short"/> and erm <pause dur="short"/> I remember that Christmas you know we didn't have a lot of toys or anything like that I mean you just couldn't buy them we were all on ration books and one of the things you know we had was a toyshop mummy said erm was there something I would really like for Christmas I could just have one thing? <pause dur="short"/> and said oh mummy I would really like a dolly erm is it possible with the coupon to get a dolly? so she said we'll I'll erm <pause dur="short"/> when I'm down I'll call in the toyshop and we'll see if we can get one for you <pause dur="short"/> well she came home but erm no <pause dur="short"/> there were no they there were not enough erm in the ration book to get a dolly and they erm we couldn't manage one but if I would like there was one thing they could manage for me with what we'd got and that was I don't know we probably wouldn't be allowed to say the word now but it was a gollywog and it had a little black face with erm nice smiling red lips and sort of fluffy black hair erm so I said oh yes please that would that would be lovely so for that Christmas erm <pause dur="short"/> I had a gollywog which was my pride and joy and my love for many many years and erm <pause dur="short"/> it was just super it did the trick it was not a dolly but it was just lovely and I was so much appreciated it so that's another little memory <pause dur="short"/> erm and while I was so poorly I was not erm <pause dur="short"/> you know I had special food and drinks and that sort of thing and I know I was on tablets called <pause dur="short"/> m and B tablets erm which were I suppose the ones they could only ones they could give me for antibiotics <pause dur="short"/> and I'm afraid to say that erm I was a little bit naughty on occasions <vocal desc="laugh"/> I didn't want to take this medicine <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I shouldn't've played up but erm I think I did and erm I know when mother had a <trunc>n</trunc> one of the neighbours round and they were trying to persuade me to get down this horrible stuff which erm mum used to crush erm I suppose it was tablets which had to be crushed down she crushed them down to like a little powder and to try and get me to take it erm <pause dur="short"/> they had we had one pot of jam erm per month <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and so I was given a teaspoon of jam to eat with <pause dur="short"/> all this crushed white powder in it er it was erm <vocal desc="laugh"/> it was not nice at all but erm <pause dur="short"/> somehow it got it it was put down me anyway whether I liked it or I didn't like it I it had to be done erm so erm I had it and <pause dur="short"/> we had nice things like gruel I remember</u>
<u n="23" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="24" who="S0507">erm <pause dur="short"/> and in the war <pause dur="short"/> you know butter erm was very very scarce we had erm sort of I think one half a pound a month erm and then we had the block margarine <pause dur="short"/> and my grandmother you know to make things go round would erm spread one slice thinly with butter and then one slice thinly with margarine and it would be cut up <pause dur="short"/> well my crafty brother two years older than me <pause dur="short"/> erm if he could get his hands on the bread first he would see that he got the bread with the butter on</u>
<u n="25" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0507">and <vocal desc="laugh"/> I and I was left with the one with the <trunc>m</trunc> erm the margarine erm so that's another little memory erm and I remember my brother and I <pause dur="short"/> you know for playing games erm <pause dur="short"/> we had a large table in our dining room and we had erm <pause dur="short"/> could have a long cloth over it erm might've been a sheet mother provided I can't quite remember but anyway it went down to the floor so brother and I used to have this like a little house inside and we used to play could we go and play games in the house and mother would get it all erm organised for us and that was great fun <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I can remember on one occasion when probably we'd been playing up <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and it was very very rare but I can remember my mother chasing us around the <vocal desc="laugh"/> chasing us around the house we'd been naughty about something but I can't quite remember what but erm <pause dur="short"/> that sort of sticks out in my memory <pause dur="short"/> so that's my young childhood memories I think erm of young childhood yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0486" trans="overlap">well thank you very much they're very <trunc>interest</trunc> you obviously had a very nice childhood didn't you? erm and er <trunc>i</trunc> er you know? erm wonderful would that be called an Anderson shelter the one you were in?</u>

<u n="38" who="S0507">well obviously I would describe her as I last knew her <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I would say medium height sort of light brown hair erm blueish eyes <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and a lovely smile <pause dur="short"/> and always sort of a very erm <pause dur="short"/> happy demeanour in the house and very kind and helpful</u>

<u n="40" who="S0507">no I did know erm <pause dur="short"/> because where erm <pause dur="short"/> we lived was not too far I suppose from <anon type="place"/> er the factories that erm were in the nearby town <pause dur="short"/> were changed for wartime work and some of them built erm <pause dur="short"/> well I don't know whether it was erm <pause dur="short"/> bomb making things but things that the Germans erm would want to <pause dur="short"/> bomb if they could to stop</u>
