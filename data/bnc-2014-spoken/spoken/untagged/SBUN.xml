<u n="6" who="S0465">yes</u>
<u n="7" who="S0456">it has a very unexciting title because it's erm <pause dur="short"/> the erm <pause dur="short"/> use of <pause dur="short"/> of and to <pause dur="short"/> in multi-word units</u>
<u n="8" who="S0465">oh right</u>
<u n="9" who="S0456">so</u>

<u n="11" who="S0456">going away from from them just being prepositions <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> or the to infinitive <pause dur="short"/> but looking at <pause dur="short"/> where where is it used where is it used mostly <pause dur="short"/> they can be prepositions they can be to-infinitives <pause dur="short"/> but yeah they're they are the things <pause dur="short"/> and that also varies <pause dur="short"/> between erm <pause dur="short"/> when it's being used when whether you speak <pause dur="short"/> whether it's <pause dur="short"/> you're delivering a speech</u>
<u n="12" who="S0465">yeah</u>

<u n="20" who="S0465">have you have you taken anything for?</u>
<u n="21" who="S0456" trans="overlap">but it's it it means it means <pause dur="short"/> I think the total sold now <pause dur="short"/> is two hundred thirty <pause dur="short"/> something like that</u>
<u n="22" who="S0465">two hundred thirty?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0456">yeah <pause dur="short"/> once once it <trunc>re</trunc> goes over <pause dur="short"/> I think it was three hundred but I don't think they said like three hundred fifty once it goes over three hundred fifty <pause dur="short"/> they'll they'll consider doing a <pause dur="short"/> paperback</u>
<u n="24" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0456">erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> we'll see <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>

<u n="29" who="S0456">it's <pause dur="short"/> there's there's more in favour <pause dur="short"/> erm of that</u>

<u n="32" who="S0465">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0456">so but yeah that's that's that's just the kind of <pause dur="short"/> job that I'm giving myself I haven't even finished this one <pause dur="short"/> I had not even finished this one then I started on that one</u>

<u n="82" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0465">but er we don't have er the sound of <pause dur="short"/> the in Kurdish <pause dur="short"/> the</u>
<u n="84" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0465">but in Arabic there is the sound of er of the pronunciation of the</u>
<u n="86" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0465">again</u>
<u n="88" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="89" who="S0465">the er doesn't exist</u>
<u n="90" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0465">in Farsi <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="92" who="S0456" trans="overlap">so is it but is it just single sounds that are different?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0465" trans="overlap">single sounds yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah single sounds yeah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0456" trans="overlap">cos <pause dur="short"/> you still have the <pause dur="short"/> if you look at <pause dur="short"/> say Icelandic <pause dur="short"/> which</u>
<u n="95" who="S0465">yeah</u>

<u n="106" who="S0456">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0465">again they don't have the sound of vur</u>
<u n="108" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="109" who="S0465">so <trunc>i</trunc><trunc>i</trunc><trunc>n</trunc> I think Kurdish more <pause dur="short"/> similar</u>
<u n="110" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0465">Farsi than <pause dur="short"/> to Arabic you know but <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't say <trunc>d</trunc></u>
<u n="112" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0465">entirely different but <pause dur="short"/> there there are just</u>
<u n="114" who="S0456">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0465">it's easier for Kurdish people to <pause dur="short"/> learn Farsi <pause dur="short"/> than Arabic</u>
<u n="116" who="S0456">right</u>
<u n="117" who="S0465">the grammar or Arabic grammar is</u>
<u n="118" who="S0456">very different</u>
<u n="119" who="S0465" trans="overlap">difficult and</u>
<u n="120" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0465">er complicated <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but it's not <pause dur="short"/> difficult to learn it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="122" who="S0456"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but the the conference I was at in <pause dur="short"/> in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> there was at where there were two and one <pause dur="short"/> fairly average was <pause dur="short"/> unfortunately <unclear>early cos he looked after him so in the scripts</unclear> of the conference <pause dur="short"/> but he was <pause dur="short"/> from <pause dur="short"/> irani <pause dur="short"/> kurdistan</u>
<u n="123" who="S0465" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="124" who="S0456">and it was <pause dur="short"/> about <pause dur="short"/> yeah learning because he said the Iranian Constitution</u>
<u n="125" who="S0465">mm</u>
<u n="126" who="S0456">guarantees <pause dur="short"/> that kind of freedom so there's there should be no discrimination depending on <pause dur="short"/> what religion you have et cetera <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> or what background</u>
<u n="127" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0456">he said so that's in the Constitution however if you then go by the <pause dur="short"/> curriculum <pause dur="short"/> the school curriculum <pause dur="short"/> things are not possible <pause dur="short"/> so he said that if you have Kurdish born kids <pause dur="short"/> in mixed cities <pause dur="short"/> usually the border cities</u>
<u n="129" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0456">they cannot explain <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> traditional festivities et cetera</u>
<u n="131" who="S0465">oh right</u>
<u n="132" who="S0456" trans="overlap">because what they <pause dur="short"/> they have to then use Farsi <pause dur="short"/> to explain it</u>
<u n="133" who="S0465" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0456">which makes it more difficult for them</u>
<u n="135" who="S0465">yes <unclear>okay</unclear></u>
<u n="136" who="S0456" trans="overlap">and he said it they're looking at you know they did that was his paper <pause dur="short"/> they did the research on that</u>
<u n="137" who="S0465">mm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0456">erm <pause dur="short"/> and who that they can push the government</u>
<u n="139" who="S0465" trans="overlap">why who was they?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0456">he's he's very very <pause dur="short"/> he's very very supportive of the new regime <pause dur="short"/> and he said you know er the the group diplomats obviously that they had <pause dur="short"/> looking after the the non-nuclear <pause dur="short"/> proliferation thing <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> he said he's he's very very impressed he thinks he's one of the best diplomats <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but they they tried to do these <pause dur="short"/> this research <pause dur="short"/> so that they can say these are the things that are happening and that are happening and they would be better blah blah blah <pause dur="short"/> so they can get a change in the curriculum <pause dur="short"/> so you have erm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0465" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they haven't been successful</u>
<u n="142" who="S0456" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0465">I think last week <pause dur="short"/> or two weeks ago</u>
<u n="144" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0465">they decided that</u>
<u n="146" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0465">they proposed to the parliament that</u>
<u n="148" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0465">one of the top universities</u>
<u n="150" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0465">should have a Kurdish department</u>
<u n="152" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0465">however that's gonna be difficult because <pause dur="short"/> the students</u>
<u n="154" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0465">who well the education system's in Farsi</u>

<u n="162" who="S0456" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0465">so er that is gonna be a problem <pause dur="short"/> they haven't decided to basically sort the education system from like <trunc>pr</trunc>primary school and then</u>

<u n="165" who="S0465">college <unclear>moving up</unclear> to university <pause dur="short"/> and the other thing is <pause dur="short"/> they haven't er <pause dur="short"/> not the government is not very keen on it</u>
<u n="166" who="S0456">yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0465">at the moment <pause dur="short"/> er I've had experience with the Iranian Kurds when they come here <pause dur="short"/> and er <pause dur="short"/> erm it is sometimes difficult for us to</u>

<u n="170" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="172" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0465">because they have been educated in Farsi <pause dur="short"/> and then <trunc>i</trunc> the especially those who are educated</u>
