<u n="1" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Where was I? Huh</u>
<u n="2" who="S0049">um <pause dur="short"/> so he's just invested in somebody?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0018">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> so he's just invested in this guy who makes those magnetic boards for dyslexic students</u>
<u n="4" who="S0049">how long <trunc>w</trunc> how long ago was that?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0018">quite recent <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> noisy aeroplane <pause dur="short"/> um tut and so you know I imagine that he's got stockpiles of cash that he's willing to invest in people <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and I told <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> about your candles and the wax and the organic</u>
<u n="6" who="S0049">ah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0018">you can put it on your skin afterwards and</u>
<u n="8" who="S0049">and <trunc>d</trunc> what did she say?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0018">and I told her what else did I say? Oh I told her about the exfoliator that you can um</u>
<u n="10" who="S0049">dry it off</u>
<u n="11" who="S0018">yeah that <trunc>d</trunc></u>
<u n="12" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0018">yeah that's oil-based not well gel-based not shower cream-based <pause dur="short"/> and she sounded really oo that's what a novel product</u>
<u n="14" who="S0049">oh did she?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0018">and I explained all about your skin problems and that being you know the one of the impetuses behind</u>
<u n="16" who="S0049">oh</u>
<u n="17" who="S0018">you setting up your business <pause dur="short"/> and yeah so she said give him a call or send him a text message to see if at least you know you can get er <trunc>mee</trunc> meet up <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="18" who="S0049">that'd be great</u>
<u n="19" who="S0018">if</u>
<u n="20" who="S0049">where do they live?</u>
<u n="21" who="S0018">they live in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="22" who="S0049">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> so close</u>
<u n="23" who="S0018">not far from me <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="24" who="S0049">okay <pause dur="short"/> brilliant</u>
<u n="25" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> and so I don't know he I know he's quite busy <pause dur="short"/> but maybe one of the days when you haven't got <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0018">we could go round together and</u>
<u n="28" who="S0049">mm <pause dur="short"/> that'd be great hon <pause dur="short"/> cos I've um today I've <trunc>st</trunc> I've just sent off to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0049">all the labels <pause dur="short"/> she sent sent me them all through so she sent all the labels but there were loads of um tut changes <pause dur="short"/> for instance there was she'd put and signs instead of the cross signs and things like that <pause dur="short"/> and um oh well I'll show you <pause dur="short"/> so I've just sent those <pause dur="short"/> and then I've just e-mailed somebody about a stamp <pause dur="short"/> because I don't know the best way to do it <pause dur="short"/> because Honest logo it's got Honest <pause dur="short"/> then the facial range has got the brown line <pause dur="short"/> the body's got the green line <pause dur="short"/> the <trunc>f</trunc> body's um <trunc>f</trunc> tut candles have got the orange line <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>s</trunc> but I don't want to buy three separate stamps with three different colours <pause dur="short"/> cos it's gonna cost a fortune</u>
<u n="31" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0049">so I've just e-mailed this stamp company to say could I have a stamp pad with three lines in and then just honest logo on its own <pause dur="short"/> because obviously I can't sell a candle in a bag stamped with the <trunc>gree</trunc> with the green line or the brown line <pause dur="short"/> do you see what I mean?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so how would that work? Would you <trunc>s</trunc> the three coloured bars are separate to the logo?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0049">the logo is the line <trunc>w</trunc> is is the colour <pause dur="short"/> so for instance when someone buys a candle it comes in the cotton bag <pause dur="short"/> it'll be stamped with the Honest logo but in-between the Honest and the website there's a line <pause dur="short"/> and that will be orange because the candles the home range is orange <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> Um</u>
<u n="35" who="S0018">but how do you stamp if you're gonna get a stamp with the logo and three different colour <trunc>li</trunc> lines <pause dur="short"/> ah okay <pause dur="short"/> so you'd <unclear/></u>
<u n="36" who="S0049">so you'd choose your colour and then</u>
<u n="37" who="S0018">yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="38" who="S0049">so I've gotta see how much <trunc>tha</trunc> that comes back as at <pause dur="short"/> and then</u>
<u n="39" who="S0018">have you got a provider for that? Have you got a supplier?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0049">um yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I've just e-mailed them now</u>
<u n="41" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="42" who="S0049">so um I think it'll be about fifteen pounds I think <pause dur="short"/> which isn't bad <pause dur="short"/> and it's gonna be better than printing bags <pause dur="short"/> it's gonna be more expensive to print</u>
<u n="43" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0049">the only problem I've got is is the ink going to run into the cotton bag? Cos they're fine on the boxes</u>
<u n="45" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> is there none</u>
<u n="46" who="S0049">so</u>
<u n="47" who="S0018">that you can get that you can iron them and that fixes the ink?</u>
<u n="48" who="S0049">oh I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I'll see what she I did  I did  put in the e-mail that um</u>
<u n="49" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="50" who="S0049">tut um that I needed it for cotton bags and boxes <pause dur="short"/> so I'll see what she says anyway <pause dur="short"/> and then on another good note <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> at Jigsaw who's my friend has asked me to go in on a Saturday</u>
<u n="51" who="S0018">mhm</u>

<u n="64" who="S0049">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so that's good</u>
<u n="65" who="S0018">are you gonna have enough ingredients to make up enough products?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0049">um <pause dur="short"/> well on another note</u>
<u n="67" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0049">I've spoke to a guy this morning who found me on LinkedIn</u>
<u n="69" who="S0018">oh yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0049">he invited me to be to link with him <pause dur="short"/> so I sent him an e-mail because he does manufacturing of small runs of natural products</u>
<u n="71" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/>h</u>
<u n="72" who="S0049">with no chemicals et cetera <pause dur="short"/> so um then he rang me this morning and said he'd give me a quote to make up a hundred of each product <pause dur="short"/> and he's already got all the ingredients</u>
<u n="73" who="S0018">fantastic</u>
<u n="74" who="S0049">so er in a way it might be worth me going that way</u>
<u n="75" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0049">so I can be out on the road selling</u>
<u n="77" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0049">than making everything up when he's already got everything <pause dur="short"/> and it might work out a little bit cheaper</u>

<u n="87" who="S0018">and what does he want in return for that?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0049">I'll obviously pay him <pause dur="short"/> but normally what he does is he he er he's <trunc>p</trunc> in product development <pause dur="short"/> he'll so for instance if I said right say imagine I didn't have enough time to develop my men's range <pause dur="short"/> I could say right this is what I want <pause dur="short"/> this is what I want in it <pause dur="short"/> can you develop it for me? And then he would make it all up and <pause dur="short"/> so he's got a factory <pause dur="short"/> and his website is nice</u>

<u n="651" who="S0049">you get your thistle oil <pause dur="short"/> five hundred mil for five pounds sixty <pause dur="short"/> so you need to work out how much one mil is</u>
<u n="652" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="653" who="S0049">so we need to divide <pause dur="short"/> so get the price for that <pause dur="short"/> and then we need to times it er one mil by four</u>
<u n="654" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="655" who="S0049">which give us the price for the thistle oil</u>
<u n="656" who="S0018">yeah</u>

<u n="658" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="659" who="S0049">it's gonna it's such a hard long job <pause dur="short"/> it's I think it <trunc>w</trunc>  it <trunc>w</trunc>  definitely I remember when I did it before I I just it's so confusing <pause dur="short"/> but I don't know if that's gonna be enough for him to</u>
<u n="660" who="S0018">I'm sure it will be <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="661" who="S0049">um</u>
<u n="662" who="S0018">are these in millilitres?</u>
<u n="663" who="S0049">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and for instance <pause dur="short"/> everything's in mil</u>
<u n="664" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="665" who="S0049">except for essential oils <pause dur="short"/> so obviously everything's got essential oils in <pause dur="short"/> so on tea tree lavender <trunc>lemo</trunc> lemon essential oils I've got three drops two drops two drops <pause dur="short"/> because this these are all making a hundred mil</u>
<u n="666" who="S0018">right <pause dur="short"/> and how many er?</u>
<u n="667" who="S0049">so they all add up to a hundred</u>
<u n="668" who="S0018">so where you've got your for example when you buy your bottles of lemon essential oil how many drops are in each bottle <pause dur="short"/> do you know</u>
<u n="669" who="S0049">um <pause dur="short"/> okay so say let's think about this then <pause dur="short"/> if I bought lemon essential oil <pause dur="short"/> thirty mil is seven pounds ninety <pause dur="short"/> so thirty mil one mil of essential oil is twenty-four drops</u>
<u n="670" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="671" who="S0049">so</u>
<u n="672" who="S0018">so it's twenty-four times thirty <pause dur="short"/> which is mm seven hundred and twenty <pause dur="short"/> so you get seven hundred and twenty drops out of a thirty mil bottle</u>
<u n="673" who="S0049">I'm sure it's twenty-four drops <pause dur="short"/> because nought point six mil is twelve drops</u>
<u n="674" who="S0018">wait there sorry <trunc>w</trunc> you said a thirty mil bottle <pause dur="short"/> how many drops in one mil?</u>
<u n="675" who="S0049">one mil is twenty-four drops</u>
<u n="676" who="S0018">so it'd be twenty-four times three <pause dur="short"/> two four six <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>s</trunc> seventy-two <pause dur="short"/> add a <trunc>nou</trunc> add a zero on <pause dur="short"/> seven hundred and twenty <pause dur="short"/> no?</u>
<u n="677" who="S0049">oh I dunno babe</u>
<u n="678" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="679" who="S0049">God it's just doing my head in</u>
<u n="680" who="S0018">no but</u>
<u n="681" who="S0049">um</u>
<u n="682" who="S0018">I think you've got all the raw data there that he'll need to be able to do the</u>
<u n="683" who="S0049">but this isn't including VAT <pause dur="short"/> I just haven't had time to <pause dur="short"/> and the only other thing the only things I need to do are my three cleansers now</u>
<u n="684" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="685" who="S0049">Cos the formulation's changed <pause dur="short"/> so I've got to do those <pause dur="short"/> but um you know like preservative there I've got nought point six mil of preservative <pause dur="short"/> which is yeah twelve drops</u>
<u n="686" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="687" who="S0049">um <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> eighteen drops of grapefruit <pause dur="short"/> three gram <pause dur="short"/> it's like it's just er it's just <trunc>n</trunc> it confuses me</u>
<u n="688" who="S0018">well as long as you've got on the original sheet how <trunc>w</trunc> the quantities in which you buy it</u>
<u n="689" who="S0049">mm</u>
<u n="690" who="S0018">and the price of that <pause dur="short"/> I mean he can</u>
<u n="691" who="S0049">so um er the next thing I need to do for him now er is find the prices of my bottles</u>
<u n="692" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="693" who="S0049">and I don't know the <trunc>si</trunc> the price of my labels yet until um</u>
<u n="694" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> of course</u>
<u n="695" who="S0049">it all goes through <pause dur="short"/> and I'm I reckon they'll all be about between nine and eleven P a label</u>
<u n="696" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="697" who="S0049">but I'm not a hundred percent yet <pause dur="short"/> but we can always add that on</u>
<u n="698" who="S0018">so it's you've put the cost and then with VAT VAT? <trunc>H</trunc> is VAT just that <pause dur="short"/> the cost plus</u>
<u n="699" who="S0049">vAT</u>
<u n="700" who="S0018">what is it? Seventeen point point five percent?</u>
<u n="701" who="S0049">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so um <pause dur="short"/> and the thing is on some of them they're classed as food so you don't get charged  you don't get charged  VAT</u>
<u n="702" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="703" who="S0049">um <pause dur="short"/> so I've got oils <pause dur="short"/> vitamins <pause dur="short"/> these are like <trunc>m</trunc> um moisturizers <pause dur="short"/> essential oils <pause dur="short"/> organic and non-organic <pause dur="short"/> emulsifiers and clays <pause dur="short"/> floral waters <pause dur="short"/> and for instance I haven't really I should put on the <trunc>w</trunc> on water as well from <trunc>h</trunc> like how much was that water that just cost you?</u>
<u n="704" who="S0018">sixty-eight P</u>
<u n="705" who="S0049">for <trunc>wat</trunc> for one litre of water <pause dur="short"/> so I need to put that on as well <pause dur="short"/> but obviously this doesn't include when Lara did <trunc>m</trunc> some costings for me this doesn't include anything electrical</u>
<u n="706" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="707" who="S0049">anything you know heating <pause dur="short"/> my time <pause dur="short"/> or anything does it <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="708" who="S0018">but it's a good idea to get an idea of what the cost is for each particular bottle <pause dur="short"/> for example</u>
<u n="709" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="710" who="S0018">like if you <trunc>s</trunc> say okay I've got a bottle of cleansing lotion <pause dur="short"/> I'm selling it at this price <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="711" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="712" who="S0018">what it takes to make it costs this much</u>
<u n="713" who="S0049">Cos my old cleanser cost me one pound seventy-nine to make <pause dur="short"/> but it only had three ingredients in <pause dur="short"/> cos in this new cleanser's got say ten ingredients in <pause dur="short"/> er so and also all these add up to a hundred <pause dur="short"/> cos I work in a hundred percent <pause dur="short"/> but I sell body polish in two hundred and fifty mil</u>
<u n="714" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="715" who="S0049">I sell my lip balm in fifteen mil <pause dur="short"/> body lotion sells in two fifty mil <pause dur="short"/> do you see what I mean? So it's so if it's body lotion</u>
<u n="716" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="717" who="S0049">it's that times that again times half isn't it</u>
<u n="718" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well maybe what would be a good idea is that when we organize to meet <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you know er to chat about the investment</u>
<u n="719" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="720" who="S0018">that we maybe go and see my dad at the same time <pause dur="short"/> cos he</u>

<u n="900" who="S0049">nought five?</u>
<u n="901" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> because cos that's higher than five <pause dur="short"/> just</u>
<u n="902" who="S0049">oh okay</u>
<u n="903" who="S0018">put the next number up <pause dur="short"/> in fact we're lower than five</u>
<u n="904" who="S0049">oh right <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="905" who="S0018">you'd just keep it to</u>
<u n="906" who="S0049">okay</u>
<u n="907" who="S0018">nought point nought four</u>
<u n="908" who="S0049">so nought point nought five <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="909" who="S0018">okay <pause dur="short"/> the next one is water</u>
<u n="910" who="S0049">okay <pause dur="short"/> so um</u>
<u n="911" who="S0018"><trunc>S</trunc></u>
<u n="912" who="S0049">you just bought that water</u>
<u n="913" who="S0018">er you can get it cheaper though if you buy it in bulk <pause dur="short"/> I reckon</u>
<u n="914" who="S0049">okay</u>
<u n="915" who="S0018">if you got like er a pack of six <pause dur="short"/> you could probably even get organic water from somewhere if they do</u>
<u n="916" who="S0049">let's just see on here</u>
<u n="917" who="S0018">if they do organic sparkling water <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> I'm sure they must do organic spring water <pause dur="short"/> check out on Asda</u>
<u n="918" who="S0049">oh let's just</u>
<u n="919" who="S0018">maybe they were just um out of</u>
<u n="920" who="S0049">I just I've never really er <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="921" who="S0018">out of stock <pause dur="short"/> oh Highland Spring</u>
<u n="922" who="S0049">if you buy organic water you're a fucking idiot</u>
<u n="923" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Excuse your French <pause dur="short"/> look on Highland Spring <pause dur="short"/> cos they're they were the ones that did the organic sparkling water <pause dur="short"/> so maybe they they do <trunc>s</trunc> still as well <pause dur="short"/> have they got a page for the organic range? What was that there? mm</u>
<u n="924" who="S0049"><trunc>S</trunc> Highland Spring still</u>
<u n="925" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't say if it's organic though <pause dur="short"/> cos they definitely did have a a range of organic waters <pause dur="short"/> check out Highland Spring organic maybe</u>
<u n="926" who="S0049">oh Tesco <pause dur="short"/> hm</u>
<u n="927" who="S0018">oh yeah look</u>
<u n="928" who="S0049">oh here <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="929" who="S0018">Cos if you buy that in bulk I'm sure it'll cost a lot less than it would if you're buying it bottle by bottle in the supermarket</u>
<u n="930" who="S0049">okay so for five hundred mil sixty-five P</u>
<u n="931" who="S0018">wait there <pause dur="short"/> let me write that down <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>f</trunc></u>
<u n="932" who="S0049">um</u>
<u n="933" who="S0018">five hundred mil sixty-five P</u>
<u n="934" who="S0049">so just say for a litre it's gonna be one pound twenty <pause dur="short"/> and I reckon we'll get it cheaper than that</u>
<u n="935" who="S0018">litre one pound</u>
<u n="936" who="S0049">one pound twenty</u>
<u n="937" who="S0018">twenty</u>
<u n="938" who="S0049">just to be safe</u>
<u n="939" who="S0018">okay <pause dur="short"/> so here you've got forty mils of water <pause dur="short"/> so if one litre is one pound twenty <pause dur="short"/> so divide one <trunc>twe</trunc> one pound twenty by a thousand <pause dur="short"/> and then times it by forty <pause dur="short"/> so that's gonna cost you four point eight P for the water <pause dur="short"/> then the preservative um nought point six mils</u>
<u n="940" who="S0049">see what I should be doing now because preservative is used in all products <pause dur="short"/> instead of keep on doing this</u>
<u n="941" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="942" who="S0049">I've what we should do is um tut we should maybe find out the price for each ingredient <pause dur="short"/> just the price for for one mil</u>
<u n="943" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="944" who="S0049">do you think?</u>
<u n="945" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos then you can</u>
<u n="946" who="S0049">and then I can add it up</u>
<u n="947" who="S0018"></u>
<u n="948" who="S0049">that's how I did it before <pause dur="short"/> because otherwise we're gonna keep going back on ourselves aren't we?</u>
<u n="949" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="950" who="S0049">because we're gonna have to do preservative twenty-eight times</u>
<u n="951" who="S0018">you see that's where my dad can probably do something nifty with an Excel wordsheet</u>
<u n="952" who="S0049">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="953" who="S0018">er spreadsheet <pause dur="short"/> and um be able to just put in a formula</u>
<u n="954" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="955" who="S0018">whereby it'll calculate it all</u>
<u n="956" who="S0049">well we'll keep we'll do this one first babe and see what this one comes out as anyway</u>
<u n="957" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="958" who="S0049">so um water was four point eight <pause dur="short"/> so preservative twelve</u>
<u n="959" who="S0018">where has it got?</u>
<u n="960" who="S0049">um</u>
<u n="961" who="S0018">wait there <pause dur="short"/> have you got the prices there? Or have I got them here?</u>
<u n="962" who="S0049">um hm</u>
<u n="963" who="S0018">where are they?</u>
<u n="964" who="S0049">oh I'm all confused <pause dur="short"/> right okay so price price</u>
<u n="965" who="S0018">there you go</u>
<u n="966" who="S0049">price</u>
<u n="967" who="S0018">so those are the prices of the</u>
<u n="968" who="S0049">what's that one then?</u>
<u n="969" who="S0018">ingredients</u>
<u n="970" who="S0049">and that's <unclear/> that's <unclear/> Um so preservative twelve</u>
<u n="971" who="S0018">oh well let's just write that <pause dur="short"/> still still um organic water</u>
<u n="972" who="S0049">okay so for for um a hundred mil it's seven pounds ninety</u>
<u n="973" who="S0018">A hundred mil</u>
<u n="974" who="S0049">so what do I do? I go seven pounds ninety</u>
<u n="975" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos if you</u>
<u n="976" who="S0049">divided by a hundred</u>
<u n="977" who="S0018">if a hundred mil is seven pound ninety you wanna find out what one mil is <pause dur="short"/> so you're um divide seven ninety by a hundred</u>
<u n="978" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="979" who="S0018">yeah? And then times it by the amount of millilitres you need in the product</u>
<u n="980" who="S0049">so it's one <pause dur="short"/> so it's that isn't it</u>
<u n="981" who="S0018">preservative twelve that was? No you need nought point six</u>
<u n="982" who="S0049">oh nought point six</u>
<u n="983" who="S0018"><trunc>D</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc></u>
<u n="984" who="S0049">oh for one mil isn't it <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> nought point six is one mil</u>
<u n="985" who="S0018">nought point six what though?</u>
<u n="986" who="S0049">but then</u>
<u n="987" who="S0018">millilitres?</u>
<u n="988" who="S0049">mil <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so see this is I'm a bit confused now <pause dur="short"/> cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> by Aromantic law you're supposed to use er this is nought point six mil but <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s changed my um tox reports <pause dur="short"/> so I have to use a mil <pause dur="short"/> but I'm not using a mil because I don't want to</u>
<u n="989" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Why did he say?</u>
<u n="990" who="S0049">just to cover with <trunc>l</trunc> like EU regulations <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="991" who="S0018">well er surely that means you have to use the amount that they specify?</u>
<u n="992" who="S0049">but Aromantic are saying that you don't have to you see <pause dur="short"/> so and <trunc>Aromant</trunc> there's been a big thing er Aromantic have spoken to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> about this and they've</u>
<u n="993" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="994" who="S0049">had I dunno what's gone on <pause dur="short"/> but er so</u>
<u n="995" who="S0018"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s the guy that did your tox reports?</u>
<u n="996" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="997" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="998" who="S0049">so um I can really use up to one percent if I want <pause dur="short"/> so in a hundred percent I'd use <trunc>w</trunc> up to one percent <pause dur="short"/> which would be one mil <pause dur="short"/> so if I say because my mask has got water in it there's more chance of contamination <pause dur="short"/> so I think I should do my pricing all based on one mil of preservative</u>
<u n="999" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0049">just in case</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0049">that's I think that's what I'll do</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's a good idea</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0049">do you think?</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0049">because and then if I use less I use less</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0049">but I know that I'm not gonna use any more than one mil don't I?</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0049">do you think that makes sense?</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> definitely <pause dur="short"/> so that's is that nought point nought?</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0049">okay <pause dur="short"/> so what I'll do then so if I've wrote here</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0018">so it was one millilitre and?</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0049">um <pause dur="short"/> I'm confused babe</u>

<u n="1078" who="S0049">no it can't be right</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0018">you needed forty millilitres <pause dur="short"/> and one litre  one litre  was one pound twenty was it? No <pause dur="short"/> one litre was wait there <pause dur="short"/> I wrote it down <pause dur="short"/> one litre was one pound twenty</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0049">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and if the camomile's only nought point nought five</u>

<u n="1104" who="S0049">nought point again you see that's er the same as that isn't it?</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0018">yeah</u>

<u n="1116" who="S0049">so that's for ingredients <pause dur="short"/> then I've got bottle</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0049">I mean tut um jar <pause dur="short"/> lid <pause dur="short"/> label <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> so that's how we'd work it then</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so what you really need is each ingredient divided by <vocal desc="cough"/> the number of millilitres that it comes in</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0049">yeah <pause dur="short"/> see um</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0018">but again you can do that on Excel really easily <pause dur="short"/> just</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0049">Cos I've got my laptop working now</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0018">yeah?</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0049">so I could get the um that would be easier for your dad <pause dur="short"/> in fact we could work this out <pause dur="short"/> I could do this today</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0018">yeah but I mean he do you know how to <trunc>f</trunc> er make formulas for different columns of er of data?</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0049">no</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0018">you see my dad's brilliant at stuff like that</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0049">is he?</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0018">or what what we could do</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0049">well I could shall I um</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0018">what we could do is do it with him <pause dur="short"/> so he can</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0018">teach us how to do it <pause dur="short"/> and then you know if you had to change anything you'd be</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0049">Cos what I might just</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0018">in the know</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0049">quickly <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> Are we still recording?</u>

<u n="1140" who="S0049">um</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0018"><vocal desc="cough"/> But it is a monumental task <pause dur="short"/> that's why I think it's much better if if dad finds a way</u>
<u n="1142" who="S0049">Cos especially with his um especially um with the <trunc>la</trunc> with the um tut labels and stuff</u>
<u n="1143" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0049">Cos I'm just thinking that almond oil <pause dur="short"/> I could do some of these <pause dur="short"/> it gives me it helps me as well you see if I can</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0049">so a hundred mil <pause dur="short"/> three pound ten <pause dur="short"/> so I'd er just put three pound ten divided by a hundred</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0049">so it costs me nought point do I have to have the nought?</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0018">er</u>
<u n="1150" who="S0049">or just put nought point nought <trunc>thr</trunc> would I put that to thirty?</u>
<u n="1151" who="S0018">what do you mean? Sorry</u>
<u n="1152" who="S0049">would I have nought point nought three O? If we were rounding it off</u>
<u n="1153" who="S0018">if you er you you have to round it you can't round it up because that last digit is not higher than five</u>
<u n="1154" who="S0049">okay</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0018">so what you just do is get rid of that last digit</u>
<u n="1156" who="S0049">oh okay babe</u>
<u n="1157" who="S0018">so it's nought point nought three</u>
<u n="1158" who="S0049">so you'd have nought point nought three <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> so I'm gonna do this <pause dur="short"/> nought point nought three <pause dur="short"/> for one mil</u>
<u n="1159" who="S0018">so what's that? Nought point nought three pence?</u>
<u n="1160" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="1161" who="S0018">so put</u>
<u n="1162" who="S0049">for one mil</u>
<u n="1163" who="S0018">put P next to it <pause dur="short"/> just so that you</u>
<u n="1164" who="S0049">okay</u>
<u n="1165" who="S0018">you got it clear what it is</u>
<u n="1166" who="S0049">okay <pause dur="short"/> if I can just do some of these and then I'll shall we have a drink?</u>
<u n="1167" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> do you want do you wanna cuppa tea?</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0049">A cuppa tea</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0018">shall I put the kettle on? Or would you prefer coffee?</u>
<u n="1170" who="S0049">I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I might have a coffee actually <pause dur="short"/> do you wanna make it? Or do you want me to make it?</u>
<u n="1171" who="S0018">no no no <pause dur="short"/> I'll make it <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1172" who="S0049">what about this?</u>
<u n="1173" who="S0018">no it's fine</u>
<u n="1174" who="S0049"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1175" who="S0018">it's fine <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1176" who="S0049">it'll be funny though <trunc>lis</trunc> listening back to um</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1178" who="S0049">like did you listen back to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s conversation?</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0018">no I didn't <pause dur="short"/> I just um listened to it quickly to just to work out what um the topics were <pause dur="short"/> cos I have to write a list of what topics</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0049">what was he talking about?</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0018">gosh we were talking about loads of things</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0049"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1183" who="S0018">lots of different things <pause dur="short"/> tV programmes <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0049">he's quite interesting isn't it</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no he's a good good talker</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0049">so on this one would I take away the five or have it nought point six three?</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0018">um <pause dur="short"/> well basically how many decimal places do you want after the dot? Two? No? Cos it's easier to work your head <pause dur="short"/> cos we're talking about pence</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0049">I <trunc>d</trunc> I so don't understand babe <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0018">so you just have two decimal places after the point <pause dur="short"/> yeah? So if you wanted to round it up to three you'd round it up to nought point nought six three <pause dur="short"/> cos that's five or above</u>
<u n="1190" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0018">and so if you got nought point nought six three you wouldn't round the six up to seven because the three</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0049">right <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0018">is below five <pause dur="short"/> so it would be nought point nought six</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0049">okay <pause dur="short"/> nought point nought six</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0049">okay <pause dur="short"/> so I need to just really take off these two</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0049">off er off all the ones that I do</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but be careful because if you you can take them off but make sure you change that figure up one if the one next to it is is <trunc>m</trunc> more than five</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0049">more than five <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> I see</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0018">but it's not gonna make a huge difference <pause dur="short"/> cos you're you know even if you just make a mistake with a couple of them it's not gonna make a huge difference to your costing</u>
<u n="1202" who="S0049">okay</u>
<u n="1203" who="S0018">but it's good to be precise <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1204" who="S0049">yes <pause dur="short"/> so six pounds ninety divided by a hundred <pause dur="short"/> see the other thing is if I was to buy a litre of almond oil I'd save pounds</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0049">but because um these are like smaller</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0049">like the clay <pause dur="short"/> because I'm buying two hundred and fifty grams it's er a lot cheaper</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0018">so how much if a hundred millilitres of almond oil is three pound ten how much would like</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0049">A litre be</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0018">a litre be?</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0049">I dunno <pause dur="short"/> you <trunc>sa</trunc> but you would save cos on the  on the  on your pricing you've got thirty mil <pause dur="short"/> a hundred mil <pause dur="short"/> um two fifty mil <pause dur="short"/> five hundred mil <pause dur="short"/> a thousand <pause dur="short"/> for all different prices <pause dur="short"/> and then each one <pause dur="short"/> so imagine if I was buying that in litres</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0049">you'd save so much money wouldn't you</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0018">you'd probably be buying it at a quarter of the price wouldn't you <pause dur="short"/> per millilitre <pause dur="short"/> but you'll get there <pause dur="short"/> you'll get bigger <pause dur="short"/> you'll start making more profit and it'll start costing you less to make them</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0049"><trunc>S</trunc> so that's gonna be nought point nought seven</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0018"><trunc>W</trunc></u>
<u n="1218" who="S0049">isn't it</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0049">you can tell I didn't pass maths at school</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I don't know why <pause dur="short"/> you're learning quickly</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0049"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1223" who="S0018">then again I can't believe I'm teaching <vocal desc="laugh"/> maths <pause dur="short"/> cos</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0049"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you're a teacher</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0018">yeah I know but English not maths</u>

<u n="1227" who="S0018">I'm awful  I'm awful  with numbers</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0049">oh no er you're clever you are</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0018">my dad'll probably turn around and say you've done this all wrong <pause dur="short"/> you told her to divide it by a hundred and you needed</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0049">no</u>
<u n="1231" who="S0018">to times it by a hundred <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1232" who="S0049">no you did it right</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> No what it is is I used to get paid by the hour</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0049">okay</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0018">so I'd always be working out how much I'd get paid <pause dur="short"/> and I'd do different types of classes which were charged at different rates</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0049"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1237" who="S0018">and then I'd have to work out the um the tax that I'd have to pay and</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0049"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1239" who="S0018">so it was all about</u>
<u n="1240" who="S0049">what's that one babe? I am listening to you</u>
<u n="1241" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1242" who="S0018">um <pause dur="short"/> you tell me</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0049">one nought point one seven</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0018">no <pause dur="short"/> you only round it up <pause dur="short"/> you wouldn't er</u>
<u n="1245" who="S0049">nought point two</u>
<u n="1246" who="S0018">you wouldn't round <vocal desc="cough"/> you wouldn't round it down <pause dur="short"/> start with like the the third figure <pause dur="short"/> is it above five?</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0018">so what do you do to the second figure?</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0049">so it'd be nought point one seven</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0049">okay <pause dur="short"/> I've gotta get the gist of this</u>
<u n="1252" who="S0018">but why why would you <trunc>rou</trunc> why would you make that six</u>

<u n="1258" who="S0018"><vocal desc="cough"/> That's the only logic you need to apply</u>

<u n="1319" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1320" who="S0049">then that says because they er they reckon hand dermatitis is er and foot dermatitis is down to stress</u>
<u n="1321" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0049">the main thing <pause dur="short"/> and then if you're stressed and then you use something like you could even use lavender</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0049">and you'd still react</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0049">oh I feel so sorry for her <pause dur="short"/> and really when I <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> used to wrap my hands up at night in cling film and cream <pause dur="short"/> and when I'd wake up in the morning the my hands were soaking wet with water because my hands couldn't breathe</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0049">so in a way I er maybe I should speak to her <pause dur="short"/> she should put bandages on</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0018">gauze?</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0049">mm</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0018">or something like that</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0049">but I've got these lovely gloves from the doctors <pause dur="short"/> they're fifty pounds a pair</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0018">are they silk?</u>

<u n="1335" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="1337" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1338" who="S0049">but these ones are really nice</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0018">oh I'll tell her</u>
<u n="1340" who="S0049">I'll try and find them in a minute</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0018">what are they made out of?</u>
<u n="1342" who="S0049">um <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> they are a bit silky <pause dur="short"/> I don't know where they are <pause dur="short"/> they might be in the kitchen <pause dur="short"/> I'll have a look</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I can't imagine cling film would be the the best thing <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="1344" who="S0049">Cos cos it's hot <pause dur="short"/> makes you hot</u>
<u n="1345" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it sweats it all</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0049">and with dermatitis you <trunc>s</trunc> you and er what happens is you itch it <pause dur="short"/> the blisters come up <pause dur="short"/> then it swells <pause dur="short"/> so the skin looks swelled</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0049">and then <trunc>f</trunc> for er for it to get better you have to pop the blisters</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0018">urgh</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0049">for the skin to come off to reheal <pause dur="short"/> so it's like um a vicious circle <pause dur="short"/> so they say to put steroid cream on and put the cling film on because it's gonna burst the blisters <pause dur="short"/> but it doesn't <pause dur="short"/> it didn't work for me at all <pause dur="short"/> but the dermatologist they have to tell her that because the next step if it gets worse is she'll go to the skin hospital and then that's their that's what they do <pause dur="short"/> you have to go through the process</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0049">and then what they do at the skin hospital is you take in every single product that you use <pause dur="short"/> whether it be washing up <pause dur="short"/> skincare <pause dur="short"/> shower gels <pause dur="short"/> whatever <pause dur="short"/> and you go in this room and they put a tiny blob on your back</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0018">uh-huh <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0049">and they cover it with tape <pause dur="short"/> and you're wrapped up in tape <pause dur="short"/> and you leave it on for a week</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0049">so you can't shower for a week <pause dur="short"/> and then cos you can't get this these things wet <pause dur="short"/> and then they write on your back what what they are</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> God <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1358" who="S0049">and then you go back in a week's time and they take it all off <pause dur="short"/> and like with me I took all the Dr <pause dur="short"/>Hauschka products <pause dur="short"/> cos that's what I was using</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0049">and I reacted to er nearly every single one <pause dur="short"/> my skin had risen</u>
<u n="1361" who="S0018">huh</u>
<u n="1362" who="S0049">it was all red <pause dur="short"/> and my back was bad for months</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0018">oh no</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0049">after it had all come off <pause dur="short"/> cos I just wouldn't heal <pause dur="short"/> and then they show you then <pause dur="short"/> and then the <trunc>w</trunc> so the one she'll react to they'll know which product it is <pause dur="short"/> then they'll take that product <pause dur="short"/> they'll get</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0049">the ingredients from that product <pause dur="short"/> so even like lavender <pause dur="short"/> people think oh you won't react to lavender <pause dur="short"/> but I react to lavender</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0049">because lavender's got geranial in it <pause dur="short"/> which is a perfume</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0018">ah</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0049">and geranial is an irritant for people with eczema and dermatitis <pause dur="short"/> so it doesn't necessarily say</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0018">but isn't lavender oil just pure lavender oil?</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0049">no it's got it's obviously got things in it <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0049">and that's like on my products I've got lavender <pause dur="short"/> but on my tox report <pause dur="short"/> my incy on my labels there's geranial <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> and geranial's one of the things I reacted to</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0049">do you see what I mean? So</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0018">tut <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0049">Cos it's the components <pause dur="short"/> there's probably a thousand components in lavender oil</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0018">blimey</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0049">probably more than that</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0049">and they take out the strongest ones <pause dur="short"/> so like on my tox report and on my label there's for lavender I've got a list of things</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1384" who="S0049">and the percentages <pause dur="short"/> and I've got those on my labels for my <trunc>writi</trunc> for my label <pause dur="short"/> cos er</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0018">you would've thought that lavender essential oil would just in just</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0049">hm <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="1387" who="S0018">contain lavender oil pressed from the flowers <pause dur="short"/> no?</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0049">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but then it's still got lavender's still got things in like I can <trunc>sh</trunc></u>
<u n="1389" who="S0018">oh the</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0049">it's still got you know</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> the er</u>
<u n="1392" who="S0049">and um</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0018">the components of the oil</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0049">I'm trying to think <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and also like I'm trying to think <pause dur="short"/> like on um <pause dur="short"/> but it is only in essential oils <pause dur="short"/> even camomile has got geranial in it</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0018">really? So what is gernial? Is it a?</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0049">it's a <trunc>perf</trunc> it's a perfume <pause dur="short"/> it's a  it's a  part</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0018">A <trunc>natu</trunc></u>
<u n="1398" who="S0049">it's a component of camomile</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0018">so it's a natural perfume?</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0049">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but again it's an irritant <pause dur="short"/> so on my in my calming scrub and in fact my calming facial oil on my tox report and on my labels it says geranial</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0049">you know <pause dur="short"/> so <trunc>b</trunc> and it by law it has to go on there</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0018">oh well <pause dur="short"/> at least people can</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0049">so</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0018">people who are <trunc>aller</trunc></u>
<u n="1406" who="S0049">mm</u>
<u n="1407" who="S0018">allergic to it can see what's in it</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0049">but I was shocked because I couldn't understand with all this Hauschka business <pause dur="short"/> and I was like right so my main er ingredient er the hospital have said is geranial <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> then I get all my tox reports back and I've got geranial in my products</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0018">but the</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0049">so er so I'm like hang on so I'm like what the hell? This is what I've reacted to <pause dur="short"/> geranial <pause dur="short"/> from Dr <pause dur="short"/>Hauschka <pause dur="short"/> so and this is how I've learnt in the whole process is because I learnt that you know about all these components in all these essential oils</u>
<u n="1411" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="1412" who="S0049">so that's why my <trunc>f</trunc> in my <trunc>f</trunc> calming cleansing cream I've got no essential oils</u>
<u n="1413" who="S0018">ah okay</u>
<u n="1414" who="S0049">so I've got nothing in there that would harm</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0049">so if I went if that's why I use my calming cream <pause dur="short"/> because I know I <trunc>w</trunc> will not react to er to it</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0018">but do you react to your products</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0049">I could do <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0018">that have got geranial in?</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0049">I could do <pause dur="short"/> not at the moment <pause dur="short"/> but I could <pause dur="short"/> if say my hormones change</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0049">and say I'm not very well <pause dur="short"/> and my skin's a bit sensitive <pause dur="short"/> like my skin's sensitive at the moment <pause dur="short"/> but I haven't reacted to anything</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0049">but if my hormones change and I use something then maybe yeah <pause dur="short"/> probably would</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0049">but my calming range I wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> my balancing range and my nourishing range I would <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos of the essential oils <pause dur="short"/> but in a way there's lots of products out there which say they're calming</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0049">but I can't use them</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's just probably marketing purposes though <vocal desc="laugh"/> isn't it</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0049">yeah</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0018">that they name it in a certain way</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0049">so it just <trunc>ma</trunc> just makes me angry <pause dur="short"/> because er the stuff that is in and then you've got all that with paraben <pause dur="short"/> sulphates <pause dur="short"/> alcohol <pause dur="short"/> can you imagine?</u>

<u n="1870" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1871" who="S0049">or if someone's going into a shop and buying a candle <pause dur="short"/> a scrub <pause dur="short"/> and a moisturizer <pause dur="short"/> I'm gonna need a stronger bag aren't I</u>

<u n="1990" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no it does need something more heavy-duty doesn't it <pause dur="short"/> huh <pause dur="short"/> hm <pause dur="short"/> and the scrub's gonna be heavier isn't it <pause dur="short"/> cos this is empty</u>
<u n="1991" who="S0049">it's gonna be <trunc>f</trunc> yeah really heavy <pause dur="short"/> because it's full of salts and and it's in a box <pause dur="short"/> they come in a box as well</u>
<u n="1992" who="S0018">well in that case you're definitely gonna want a bag that's more heavy-duty so that especially well if it's in a <trunc>ba</trunc> if it's in a box that'll probably protect it</u>
<u n="1993" who="S0049">in fact</u>
