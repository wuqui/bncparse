<u n="1" who="S0086">he didn't say how it was but he didn't complain about it <pause dur="short"/> so although</u>
<u n="2" who="S0082">I think that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> if if it was it's it's it's so disagreeable</u>
<u n="3" who="S0086">yeah well yes I know cos you were complaining quite loudly about it</u>
<u n="4" who="S0082">I mean I don't think you realise how I mean it really was awful</u>
<u n="5" who="S0086">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I've had it happen to me before but I suppose because it wasn't  it wasn't  happening to me on that phone</u>
<u n="6" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="7" who="S0086">it wasn't that bad</u>
<u n="8" who="S0082">em</u>
<u n="9" who="S0086">so</u>
<u n="10" who="S0082">well I've had it a little bit at other times</u>
<u n="11" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="12" who="S0082">but it was so bad <pause dur="short"/> it was just like hearing my voice like as loud as I am now</u>
<u n="13" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0082">um and then you've got the delay and I wasn't sure whether you what you were hearing or what</u>
<u n="15" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="16" who="S0082">it was so bad <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>y</trunc> you couldn't help saying something <pause dur="short"/> so if if somebody doesn't say anything I think you can assume that it's not there</u>
<u n="17" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0082">I mean it I I'd been speaking to you for a while before I actually realised that I hadn't heard it and</u>
<u n="19" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="20" who="S0082">you know</u>
<u n="21" who="S0086">well fingers crossed maybe that's what it takes to take the sim card out again</u>
<u n="22" who="S0082">I mean I don't see</u>
<u n="23" who="S0086">maybe it wasn't quite in</u>
<u n="24" who="S0082">how these things work but um why that would make a difference</u>
<u n="25" who="S0086">ah when I leave I'll call you from the car</u>
<u n="26" who="S0082">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes do that <pause dur="short"/> and um</u>
<u n="27" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="28" who="S0082">it's got an amazing cast but I think it's probably not a terribly good film</u>
<u n="29" who="S0086">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's looks like the sort of thing where they put the best</u>
<u n="30" who="S0082">it's a bit cheesy</u>
<u n="31" who="S0086">bits like in the trailer</u>
<u n="32" who="S0082">yes and it's terribly cheesy I'm sure</u>
<u n="33" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="34" who="S0082">oh</u>
<u n="35" who="S0086">it's going to be a little bit on the patronising side I think</u>
<u n="36" who="S0082">oh yes</u>
<u n="37" who="S0086">ah aren't these Indian people lovely?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0086">they're not uncivilised at all <vocal desc="laugh"/> Well I was having a very strange conversation with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> last night where she really sort of flagged up her ignorance of some areas</u>
<u n="40" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0086">she she I think because she's she's twenty-four but because she fell out with her parents when she was quite young she moved out when she was sixteen <pause dur="short"/> so she grew up quite quickly</u>
<u n="42" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0086">so she gives  she gives  the big I am <pause dur="short"/> she is quite mature</u>
<u n="44" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0086">and she's very fiercely independent</u>
<u n="46" who="S0082">right</u>
<u n="47" who="S0086">but at the same time we were having a conversation and she was saying she's on some charity board at work you know as a way of sort of getting further ahead in the company and get involved in stuff</u>
<u n="48" who="S0082">right</u>
<u n="49" who="S0086">and then but she was saying but our charity this year is something to do with Africa and I said oh what is it? Is it CAFOD or you know Oxfam or</u>
<u n="50" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0086">she said is it one of those big ones? What is it? Amnesty you know? What is it?</u>
<u n="52" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0086">she like oh I don't know <pause dur="short"/> water Aid? You know naming as many as I could <vocal desc="laugh"/> she's like oh I don't know yeah probably one of those <pause dur="short"/> save The Children? Oh I don't know then she said you know I'm going to sound really stupid but it's they're like aliens to me? It's so far away and I said</u>
<u n="54" who="S0082">right</u>
<u n="55" who="S0086">but the  But the  surely right like now that <trunc>cu</trunc> current day because of the fact that the world does seems smaller all the time you know in the way that we communicate and the way that we are seeing people in other countries</u>
<u n="56" who="S0082">yes</u>
<u n="57" who="S0086">in television or other kinds of media <pause dur="short"/> it's sort of making it seem smaller not further away</u>
<u n="58" who="S0082">yes I</u>
<u n="59" who="S0086">but the gulf between</u>
<u n="60" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0086">how we live and how they live is growing all the time</u>
<u n="62" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0086">you know they're they're getting poorer</u>
<u n="64" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0086">as we get</u>
<u n="66" who="S0082">yes</u>
<u n="67" who="S0086">richer effectively the west as a whole <pause dur="short"/> and um she was saying I just can't understand it I'd rather give money <pause dur="short"/> not I'd rather look after my own but she said at least I can see a direct um consequence to us donating money <pause dur="short"/> I think she's <trunc>prob</trunc> it's sounds like they probably just haven't explained where the money is actually gonna go because</u>
<u n="68" who="S0082">but that's pathetic though</u>
<u n="69" who="S0086">well I agree <trunc>y</trunc> and I did talk her down and I said she did I did say well they probably someone you know and they give clean needles they provide clean water or you know</u>
<u n="70" who="S0082">uh mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0086">they probably do a multitude of things <pause dur="short"/> um and she said no I can't just I just can't see how it's actually going to help people <pause dur="short"/> I said well that's that's silly <pause dur="short"/> I said it a lot of it has to do with the <trunc>de</trunc> desensitisation of the television as well</u>
<u n="72" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0086">like you see these images and it's completely heartbreaking and then it's gone and then you've got a car car advert</u>
<u n="74" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0086">you know it does sort of it only stays with you for a matter of moments <pause dur="short"/> I said don't you remember like the Live Aid you know that was only a few years ago <pause dur="short"/> and their campaign was the fact that you know in Africa a child dies every three seconds</u>
<u n="76" who="S0082">uh mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0086">she like yeah oh yeah I'd forgotten all about that <pause dur="short"/> I'm thinking well yeah like out of sight out of mind <pause dur="short"/> that's the problem isn't it?</u>
<u n="78" who="S0082">it very much is</u>
<u n="79" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0082">in fact <trunc>y</trunc> yes <pause dur="short"/> I mean</u>
<u n="81" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0082">that's that's certainly the case but <pause dur="short"/> to feel that they're so far away so it has no impact so and and</u>
<u n="83" who="S0086">so therefore you might as well not doing anything</u>
<u n="84" who="S0082" trans="overlap">and and and also the idea that you wouldn't give to charity if you couldn't see where it</u>
<u n="85" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0082">what it was doing</u>
<u n="87" who="S0086">that was her <pause dur="short"/> and actually that's your own ignorance because you don't understand something <pause dur="short"/> cos I said well in that case why don't you find out much more about it? Cos it's probably doing a good thing</u>
<u n="88" who="S0082">exactly</u>
<u n="89" who="S0086">like can't you see it's a charity and it's helping people</u>
<u n="90" who="S0082">yes</u>
<u n="91" who="S0086">so why if you're on the board and you didn't know why didn't you ask?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0082">it would take  it would take  five minutes on Google to find out what the charity is and</u>
<u n="93" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0082">what it's doing</u>
<u n="95" who="S0086">or ask the people if they were making the announcement in the meeting</u>
<u n="96" who="S0082">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0086">right this is going to be a charity <pause dur="short"/> why not say okay well I'm sorry I don't know who they are</u>
<u n="98" who="S0082">tell us more about it <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0086" trans="overlap">and what they're doing</u>
<u n="100" who="S0082">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0086">it does seem very strange</u>
<u n="102" who="S0082">yes</u>
<u n="103" who="S0086">and she said why don't they help themselves? And I thought right don't <pause dur="short"/> you sound like a Daily Mail reader now</u>
<u n="104" who="S0082">ooh <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="105" who="S0086">she said well then how come we've got so civilised in the west and they haven't got <trunc>civilisa</trunc> <trunc>civili</trunc> <trunc>ov</trunc> civilised there?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0082"><vocal desc="gasp"/> Oh god</u>
<u n="107" who="S0086">and I thought oh god</u>
<u n="108" who="S0082">oh my god</u>
<u n="109" who="S0086">oh no <pause dur="short"/> so I had to you know sort of talk her down <pause dur="short"/> but I think the worry is with her is she just  she just  you know she <trunc>ju</trunc> if she can't see it <pause dur="short"/> then she doesn't want to understand it</u>
<u n="110" who="S0082">that's that's well that's the case with a lot of people I think</u>
<u n="111" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0082">and there is this perception which the west has done nothing to try and challenge that the west is civilised</u>
<u n="113" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0082">and everybody else isn't</u>
<u n="115" who="S0086">well that's what I said did you not see soldiers going into countries now and pillaging and raping? Nothing's has really changed <pause dur="short"/> when what makes us <trunc>w</trunc> what how does that make us humane?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0082">yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0086">than people in those countries</u>
<u n="118" who="S0082">what's what's civilised about that?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0086">and in fact we actually all come from Africa we come from them</u>
<u n="120" who="S0082">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0086">you know and the reason is we've we've <pause dur="short"/> she said well why is their land so uninhabitable? That's their own fault they should move <pause dur="short"/> and I said well not really <pause dur="short"/> actually they're really poor they've got nowhere to move to <pause dur="short"/> that is their land <pause dur="short"/> and if we helped them</u>
<u n="122" who="S0082">also the fact  the fact  that um a lot of Africa was fertile land</u>
<u n="123" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0082">um and it's become lesser because um if land is cleared</u>
<u n="125" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="126" who="S0082">um then you get um what do they call it? Um <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember what they call it now um <pause dur="short"/> but when it does rain it actually <trunc>wash</trunc> washes all the top soil away because there's no vegetation</u>
<u n="127" who="S0086">oh god <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="128" who="S0082">or there's very little because it's all been um I mean you know we're talking about decades of drought</u>
<u n="129" who="S0086">oh yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0082">where it used to be fertile</u>
<u n="131" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0082">um but with um <pause dur="short"/> where land was cleared for grazing</u>
<u n="133" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="134" who="S0082">and then you had drought and then when you have rain it washes the top soil away <pause dur="short"/> so there's nothing you have you haven't got sort of um fertile land for things to grow on to sort of recover from that</u>
<u n="135" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0082">so um it's there's a  there's a  whole range of things</u>
<u n="137" who="S0086">well absolutely <pause dur="short"/> and plus I mean she said why they don't do anything to help themselves <pause dur="short"/> I said well actually you know there there is</u>
<u n="138" who="S0082">and and that's not true</u>
<u n="139" who="S0086">that's not true <pause dur="short"/> and also you know the problem is you see this thing this with charities all over the place where the money is just actually not filtering down and that's because the charities aren't actually being regulated in the same way that maybe they should be <pause dur="short"/> look at the funds of money going to Haiti</u>
<u n="140" who="S0082" trans="overlap">also you do have to deal with  you do have to deal with  corrupt</u>
<u n="141" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0082">um governments</u>
<u n="143" who="S0086">well in Cuba the money never actually <pause dur="short"/> the majority of money that actually goes into the country doesn't reach the people but they're all catered for</u>
<u n="144" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0086">they've all got a basic living allowance but they could have more</u>
<u n="146" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0086">but because they they live in a socialist country</u>
<u n="148" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0086">their their government the people the clothes they're getting for example and then they sell them off</u>
<u n="150" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0086">to another third world country and make profit and then keep the money for themselves</u>
<u n="152" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0086">in Haiti they're still living in shanty towns <pause dur="short"/> new Orleans they're still living in shanty towns</u>
<u n="154" who="S0082">I know</u>
<u n="155" who="S0086">they're still living in tents under the subway</u>
<u n="156" who="S0082" trans="overlap">because the money the money isn't going to where it should</u>
<u n="157" who="S0086">no <pause dur="short"/> it's not <pause dur="short"/> and you think well that's the big reason <pause dur="short"/> it's it's</u>
<u n="158" who="S0082">corruption is is a huge thing <pause dur="short"/> it it will always happen <pause dur="short"/> vested interests you know</u>
<u n="159" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="160" who="S0082">so <trunc>w</trunc> when you do get a disaster the money that goes in will be  will be  put into projects that you know um government or big corporations or you know developers</u>
<u n="161" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0082">will have a vested interest in in choosing this route</u>
<u n="163" who="S0086">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0082">rather than you know just actually kind of handing it over and helping the people that really need it <pause dur="short"/> I mean there's always a kind of <trunc>t</trunc> there's always an element of that</u>
<u n="165" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0082">so the people on <trunc>t</trunc> the ground don't actually benefit from that</u>
<u n="167" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="168" who="S0082">and that  And that  happens whether it's you know America or Africa</u>
<u n="169" who="S0086">oh absolutely <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0082">so there's no difference there <pause dur="short"/> there's corruption everywhere <pause dur="short"/> there's vested interests everywhere</u>
<u n="171" who="S0086">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's what I was pointing out about New Orleans</u>
<u n="172" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0086">and trying to make it so that it's not them and us</u>
<u n="174" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0086">you know <pause dur="short"/> I think a lot of it is just ignorance and I</u>
<u n="176" who="S0082">mm it is</u>
<u n="177" who="S0086">you know I'm ignorant to a lot of I as well</u>
<u n="178" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="179" who="S0086">but I think I try and read about stuff at the same time</u>
<u n="180" who="S0082">well yeah and be open to it</u>
<u n="181" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="182" who="S0082">absolutely</u>
<u n="183" who="S0086">I reckon I'm a bit of a goldfish <pause dur="short"/> if I watch something or read something in the newspaper I think oh I don't really understand that</u>
<u n="184" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="185" who="S0086">I try and investigate it I might read a book or I might go online or I might <trunc>r</trunc> read the paper and in that period of time I try and understand it and then I think or then something else comes along</u>
<u n="186" who="S0082">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well that's the same as all of us</u>
<u n="187" who="S0086" trans="overlap">that's sort of the nature of it <pause dur="short"/> but this idea that oh I don't understand it therefore I don't want to engage with it</u>
<u n="188" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0086">they're far away therefore</u>
<u n="190" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="191" who="S0086">I shouldn't give them money <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="192" who="S0082">there's also um you've got things like small farmers who try and sell <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> this is quite a big thing that that was <pause dur="short"/> um we were sort of things were explained to us at the time of remember the <trunc>d</trunc> drop the debt thing in two thousand?</u>
<u n="193" who="S0086">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="194" who="S0082">um the World Health Organisation and the World Trade Organisation people like this you know they're set up to sort of provide um kind of help and sort of</u>
<u n="195" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0082">an overseeing kind of role</u>
<u n="197" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="198" who="S0082">but they're hugely corrupt as well</u>
<u n="199" who="S0086">mm hm</u>
<u n="200" who="S0082">and and and even if they're not you know the balance is is out</u>
<u n="201" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="202" who="S0082">I mean they're there to sort of oversee like fair trade and trade agreements between countries and continents</u>
<u n="203" who="S0086">mm</u>

<u n="292" who="S0082">yes</u>
<u n="293" who="S0086">even officers <pause dur="short"/> cos officers</u>
<u n="294" who="S0082">oh yeah</u>
<u n="295" who="S0086">officers don't have to be told what to do it just cascades down</u>
<u n="296" who="S0082">well <trunc>off</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> well officers are usually from a class where they have that sense of superiority anyway that's kind of natural to them so</u>
<u n="297" who="S0086">well yeah because they're this is  this is  why she is doing it now this is the last year she can do it cos she's five years out of university</u>
<u n="298" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="299" who="S0086">you can only be an officer if you're within that five years</u>
<u n="300" who="S0082">oh</u>

<u n="306" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="307" who="S0086">but the I mean the money's ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> I mean she goes in when she's training for the first three months she's on twenty-seven thousand and after that she's on forty</u>
<u n="308" who="S0082">oh</u>
<u n="309" who="S0086">disgusting isn't it? And there's people out</u>
<u n="310" who="S0082">Good god</u>
<u n="311" who="S0086">out in Afghanistan with you know malfunctioning kits and you think they're actually paying people around forty grand a year <pause dur="short"/> it's ridiculous and then they're but they're  but they're  um <pause dur="short"/> they're you know they're firing lots of people aren't they? They're cutting back</u>
<u n="312" who="S0082">they are cutting back</u>
<u n="313" who="S0086">within the services</u>
<u n="314" who="S0082">absolutely</u>
<u n="315" who="S0086">so it seems strange</u>
<u n="316" who="S0082">I know</u>
<u n="317" who="S0086">why you would look at everything just across the board</u>
<u n="318" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="319" who="S0086">but she had her entry exam the other day and she passed <pause dur="short"/> so at this point she only has to do the medical which she thinks she'll probably pass</u>
<u n="320" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="321" who="S0086">even though she's got she's long sighted or is she short sighted? Is it when you can see you can't see here but you can't see over there that's short sighted?</u>
<u n="322" who="S0082">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="323" who="S0086">yeah so she's short sighted <pause dur="short"/> um but the fitness thing is a bit of a worry cos she's she's not big but she just carries a few extra pounds</u>
<u n="324" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="325" who="S0086">probably a size fourteen but she's been trying to lose weight for ages and she can run</u>
<u n="326" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="327" who="S0086">and when she went for the entry exam the guy said right at this point you know those of you have passed need to do this and this to get ready for your fitness <pause dur="short"/> then he said you should be aiming to run a mile and a half in sixteen minutes well she's running it in fifteen and a half</u>
<u n="328" who="S0082">oh <pause dur="short"/> that's very good</u>
<u n="329" who="S0086">and you should be swimming once a week and you should be  you should be  doing weight training <pause dur="short"/> she said I've already been doing that for three months because she knew that is what they would require</u>
<u n="330" who="S0082">okay</u>
<u n="331" who="S0086">and he said okay so how fast are you running it? And he she said fifteen and a half and he said and I don't mean to be rude but how heavy are you? And she said however heavy she is maybe like thirteen fourteen stone <pause dur="short"/> and he said I cannot believe you know I trust what you're saying</u>
<u n="332" who="S0082">yeah</u>
<u n="333" who="S0086">but I cannot believe that you at your weight can run and your heart can take it</u>
<u n="334" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="335" who="S0086">he said if you turned up for your medical now you wouldn't pass <pause dur="short"/> like if you sent in your <trunc>med</trunc> cos you have to send in a medical slip and then they look at it before they get you in</u>
<u n="336" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="337" who="S0086">and if they saw that she was fourteen stone but running it at fifteen and a half minutes they'd think she was lying and dismiss her out of hand <pause dur="short"/> so she so he said I'm not saying this but you should lie and put down your the weight that you're aiming for and then push and the longest you can leave it at this point is six weeks</u>
<u n="338" who="S0082">right</u>
<u n="339" who="S0086">before having to actually have the fitness <pause dur="short"/> I mean it sounds mad and then  and then  at that point you have to do this um these practical</u>
<u n="340" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="341" who="S0086">training situations because she's going in as an officer with problem solving and you've got to get your team of across</u>
<u n="342" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="343" who="S0086">some issue and then you've got to go out running around in your pack <pause dur="short"/> but we watched the propaganda DVD that they sent through and it horrifies me <pause dur="short"/> everyone's running around and I think the thing is what concerns me is she's not engaging with the fact that she will potentially go to war</u>
<u n="344" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="345" who="S0086">if you're in the services obviously</u>
<u n="346" who="S0082">yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0086">that's what you have to prepare yourself for</u>
<u n="348" who="S0082">yeah</u>

<u n="394" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="395" who="S0086">but I think she thinks that she's going in as a as an officer she could tell everyone else what to do but it's not going to work like that <pause dur="short"/> because ultimately you're within the regime</u>
<u n="396" who="S0082">uh</u>
<u n="397" who="S0086">so I don't know <pause dur="short"/> the good thing is you get three months and at that point at the end of the three months you get to decide whether you sign up</u>

<u n="486" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="487" who="S0086">the fact that she so quickly and so readily allowed you to meet the kids <pause dur="short"/> he stayed over on the sofa one night and they just bowled in and he and that was after the first week</u>
<u n="488" who="S0082">some women are just they just don't <trunc>ca</trunc> seem to care and they don't</u>

<u n="504" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="505" who="S0086">is a bit concerning <pause dur="short"/> and how many blokes have there been before?</u>

<u n="507" who="S0086">you know when it's just you that's fine <pause dur="short"/> you're a single woman you can do what you like but if you've got kids it's</u>

<u n="509" who="S0086">it's very different <pause dur="short"/> I mean I you know I don't want to judge but it seems a bit</u>
<u n="510" who="S0082">it's a bit weird</u>
<u n="511" who="S0086">it seems a bit strange <pause dur="short"/> so it's like Jeremy Kyle</u>

<u n="534" who="S0082">and it's a crap shower</u>
<u n="535" who="S0086">who's actually qualified to come round and have a look at it? He said she said well it's very hard you know? What I'm I supposed to do? Fix it?</u>
