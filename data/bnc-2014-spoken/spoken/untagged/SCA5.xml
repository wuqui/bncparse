<u n="244" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="245" who="S0024">it he's been using it well he's been playing with it for a while</u>

<u n="248" who="S0144">it's gonna  it's gonna  take ages cos I'm not the world's greatest mixer <pause dur="short"/> I'm gonna have to like record two tracks and when I've got that right then I'm gonna have to take that file and put it in <pause dur="short"/> and then record another track</u>
<u n="249" who="S0024">on top of it</u>
<u n="250" who="S0144">on top of that</u>
<u n="251" who="S0024">like yeah</u>
<u n="252" who="S0144">and then use that file and keep going like that <pause dur="short"/> cos I won't be able to do the whole lot in one performance</u>
<u n="253" who="S0024">no</u>
<u n="254" who="S0144">so it's gonna take bloody ages</u>
<u n="255" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0144">plus we need to find a <trunc>li</trunc> well I've made a list of songs</u>
<u n="257" who="S0024">well you never know maybe he he might let us if we have play with it on Saturday and if it works maybe he'll lend it to us for a week</u>
<u n="258" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="259" who="S0024">it would be good <pause dur="short"/> well I don't know if it works but it's an idea</u>
<u n="260" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah cos I've got I've been dividing all the music I had saved</u>
<u n="261" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="262" who="S0144">into different kind of sections now</u>
<u n="263" who="S0024">so if if you have time this week before Saturday to like put the songs in the order kind of that you want <pause dur="short"/> that you think you can</u>
<u n="264" who="S0144">well I haven't got to that stage <pause dur="short"/> I'm still putting them into different into kind of ambiences</u>
<u n="265" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="266" who="S0144">like dinner music or</u>
<u n="267" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="268" who="S0144">building creating a party atmosphere kind of music or <pause dur="short"/> it's difficult <pause dur="short"/> because what DJs normally do the benefit of having a live DJ is</u>
<u n="269" who="S0024">looking at the audience</u>
<u n="270" who="S0144">they can <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> monitor and gauge how the audience is feeling and</u>
<u n="271" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="272" who="S0144">put music to suit that <pause dur="short"/> but we won't be able to do that</u>
<u n="273" who="S0024">no</u>
<u n="274" who="S0144">so we're gonna have to try and create the atmosphere through the music <pause dur="short"/> which is gonna be <pause dur="short"/> we're gonna have to be very careful</u>
<u n="275" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah but then you've got the whole section <pause dur="short"/> I mean the band is going to be there for three hours</u>
<u n="276" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="277" who="S0024">so they they're gonna do that part so that will be a nice change of</u>
<u n="278" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="279" who="S0024">they'll be reading the  they'll be reading the  <trunc>au</trunc> like everybody there and stuff and working out</u>
<u n="280" who="S0144">well I dunno I think</u>
<u n="281" who="S0024">what goes best</u>
<u n="282" who="S0144">yeah but before like the first and second set they're gonna be playing just stuff from the iPod</u>
<u n="283" who="S0024">yeah in between</u>
<u n="284" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="285" who="S0024">but shouldn't you just let them do it do what they want</u>
<u n="286" who="S0144">yeah but I mean they might have a load of shit on there <pause dur="short"/> I mean if they're just pressing play on their iPod</u>
<u n="287" who="S0024">hm</u>
<u n="288" who="S0144">I don't know if I'd rather have control of that as well</u>
<u n="289" who="S0024">hm</u>
<u n="290" who="S0144">and say look between your sets could you just stick this CD on <pause dur="short"/> cos then it's at least it's stuff that we know we're gonna like</u>
<u n="291" who="S0024">maybe that's when we could have a salsa section <pause dur="short"/> in between the in between</u>
<u n="292" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah or after I don't know</u>
<u n="293" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="294" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> their music is quite um <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> a lot of the stuff that I like that they do is quite rocky</u>
<u n="295" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="296" who="S0144">well not rocky rocky but you know things like The Strokes and White Stripes and that kinda stuff</u>
<u n="297" who="S0024">okay</u>
<u n="298" who="S0144">um <pause dur="short"/> so whether you could divide the two sets with salsa I dunno <pause dur="short"/> or whether that would be better going after <pause dur="short"/> cos I'd quite like some funk as well</u>
<u n="299" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean I know it's our party and we're not gonna kind of what to like do too much on the day but maybe if if the CD is in a on a salsa you know just a few salsa songs <pause dur="short"/> if you separate it then maybe we could like oh now would be a good time to stick the salsa CD on</u>
<u n="300" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="301" who="S0024">do you think or do you think we be too busy yapping and socialising to do that</u>
<u n="302" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well that's it probably I mean</u>
<u n="303" who="S0024">couldn't we just go wahay can you put the salsa CD on?</u>
<u n="304" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="305" who="S0024">maybe we could do that <pause dur="short"/> I mean there's gonna be plenty of people there</u>
<u n="306" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="307" who="S0024">or</u>
<u n="308" who="S0144">what just create a whole stack of CDs and then</u>
<u n="309" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="310" who="S0144">I don't know if we would have time <pause dur="short"/> cos we will be busy yapping</u>
<u n="311" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="short"/> yapping or dancing</u>
<u n="312" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if I want</u>
<u n="313" who="S0024" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="314" who="S0144">that kind of thing to think about</u>
<u n="315" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="short"/> this the like the main like one of the biggest problems is stuff we're gonna have to think about on the day</u>
<u n="316" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0024">like the food and stuff it's like we've got to delegate some people <pause dur="short"/> like say like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and like</u>
<u n="318" who="S0144">which way d'you want to go?</u>
<u n="319" who="S0024">Down here <pause dur="short"/> we could say um <pause dur="short"/> we could even ask <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> properly and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like Could you do us a favour? Could you bring help bring out some of the food? Or something Like that</u>
<u n="320" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="321" who="S0024">and say to Uncle Brian Could you do us a favour? Could you <pause dur="short"/> I mean I'm sure everybody's gonna be doing their bit anyway cos that's what most people are like <pause dur="short"/> they just do their own thing <pause dur="short"/> but and they help out whenever they're bored or it's nice to have something to do <pause dur="short"/> I dunno if you happen to be standing there not talking to somebody you can go ah I'll just go and get the the stuff out the oven <pause dur="short"/> something like that <pause dur="short"/> like if we say to the people that we know  that we know quite well and that know the house quite well and that Mum and Dad feel comfortable going into the house <pause dur="short"/> and say Right can you sort this? and give them all jobs to do</u>
<u n="322" who="S0144">yeah</u>

<u n="324" who="S0144">no</u>

<u n="515" who="S0024">no she doesn't say she didn't like it <pause dur="short"/> I think she's a bit scared of it</u>
<u n="516" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's probably why <pause dur="short"/> no as soon as she goes <pause dur="short"/> especially somewhere like the Maldives that's crystal clear</u>
<u n="517" who="S0024">and you can see all the little fishies</u>
<u n="518" who="S0144" trans="overlap">she'd love it</u>
<u n="519" who="S0024" trans="overlap"><unclear/> stick the snorkel on her head and stick her head under water</u>
<u n="520" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah but those islands you've got  you've got  the main place which is um what is it ?</u>
<u n="521" who="S0024">right</u>
<u n="522" who="S0144">um that's just a horrible town apparently <pause dur="short"/> and then you fly out by those like sea planes</u>
<u n="523" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="524" who="S0144">and they just fly to all the different islands</u>
<u n="525" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but then that's the thing you're stuck</u>
<u n="526" who="S0144" trans="overlap">so you'd be stuck on an island which is just a hotel basically</u>
<u n="527" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="528" who="S0144">with I dunno I imagine it would get on your nerves after a while cos you're just gonna have a load of honeymooning couples</u>
<u n="529" who="S0024">yep</u>
<u n="530" who="S0144">or just extremely rich people</u>
<u n="531" who="S0024">and how high is the Maldives because</u>
<u n="532" who="S0144" trans="overlap">it's about one metre above sea level</u>
<u n="533" who="S0024">they've got that big wall <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="534" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="535" who="S0144">yeah they built this massive wall to protect it from the tsunamis</u>
<u n="536" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah but there's um there's another group of um islands</u>
<u n="537" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="538" who="S0024">I don't know where they are er</u>
<u n="539" who="S0144" trans="overlap">there's only</u>
<u n="540" who="S0024">islands?</u>
<u n="541" who="S0144">I don't know</u>
<u n="542" who="S0024">they're not by the Maldives I think but because they're only like one point two metres above sea level they've had to evacuate them all</u>
<u n="543" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="544" who="S0024">Cos the sea's just been coming in making the islands smaller and smaller</u>
<u n="545" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="546" who="S0024">so</u>
<u n="547" who="S0144">yeah I think the wall only</u>
<u n="548" who="S0024">that's gonna happen</u>
<u n="549" who="S0144">protects the the main bit as well</u>
<u n="550" who="S0024" trans="overlap">well that's gonna happen to the Maldives though if</u>
<u n="551" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="552" who="S0024">I dunno <pause dur="short"/> it is a bit scary being on a little island when it's so low</u>
<u n="553" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="554" who="S0024">in the sea <pause dur="short"/> one metre</u>
<u n="555" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="556" who="S0024">one point two metres</u>
<u n="557" who="S0144">yeah it is a bit scary isn't it</u>
<u n="558" who="S0024">are you sure it is?</u>
<u n="559" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="560" who="S0024">it must be higher than this the other one</u>
<u n="561" who="S0144">no it's</u>
<u n="562" who="S0024">where are the  islands?</u>
<u n="563" who="S0144">um well it sounds the same kind of place</u>
<u n="564" who="S0024">maybe it's some of the Maldives then</u>
<u n="565" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah it'd be nice to do but I wouldn't like to stay there for long I don't think</u>
<u n="566" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="567" who="S0144">because they're <pause dur="short"/> I don't know I don't imagine there's much culture <pause dur="short"/> unless you're on the main island ad then I mean they're gonna have to import everything</u>
<u n="568" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="569" who="S0144">so it's gonna be expensive</u>
<u n="570" who="S0024">the main island would have lots of culture wouldn't it <pause dur="short"/> they're like the local people</u>
<u n="571" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I don't know</u>
<u n="572" who="S0024">it's just the resort islands</u>
<u n="573" who="S0144">I don't know cos I did look at it and I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I think I'd just get claustrophobic</u>
<u n="574" who="S0024">ah <pause dur="short"/> you just can't escape</u>
<u n="575" who="S0144">mm <pause dur="short"/> and you're thousands of miles from anywhere</u>
<u n="576" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="577" who="S0144">that's what I wouldn't like <pause dur="short"/> don't mind being on an island if I  if I  know there's a mainland quite near</u>
<u n="578" who="S0024" trans="overlap">and yeah if any thing happens there's a lot of people to evacuate isn't there</u>
<u n="579" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="580" who="S0024">so er I dunno <pause dur="short"/> how high up the list would you be?</u>
<u n="581" who="S0144">yeah as long as you've got some money you'd be alright</u>
<u n="582" who="S0024">yes but the holiday makers <pause dur="short"/> they'd all be evacuated first <pause dur="short"/> compared to the employees <pause dur="short"/> yeah they would</u>
<u n="583" who="S0144">well that's unlikely for that to happen</u>
<u n="584" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="585" who="S0144">the main thing will just be feeling cut off <pause dur="short"/> bored</u>
<u n="586" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="587" who="S0144">I know it sounds a bit funny being bored in somewhere like that but I think you would <pause dur="short"/> after a few months</u>
<u n="588" who="S0024">oh I nearly walked down there <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="589" who="S0144">how much was it?</u>
<u n="590" who="S0024">ah I don't know</u>
<u n="591" who="S0144">has she got an interview or has she just applied to it?</u>
<u n="592" who="S0024">she's just applied that's all</u>
<u n="593" who="S0144">so she wants to get out then?</u>
<u n="594" who="S0024">I think so <pause dur="short"/> well now that her and Phil have split up</u>
<u n="595" who="S0144" trans="overlap">now she's had a taste <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="596" who="S0024">and she's had a taste of being abroad</u>
<u n="597" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="598" who="S0024">yeah and I think  I think  she wants to <pause dur="short"/> I mean it sounds really silly but it is  it is  easier than up and moving in England <pause dur="short"/> cos of her housing association and everything like that</u>
<u n="599" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="600" who="S0024">she can't just up and move because they won't go and find her another house in a different area without some sort of reason</u>
<u n="601" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="602" who="S0024">so to up and move to another country where they it I mean if her job provides accommodation for her</u>
<u n="603" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="604" who="S0024">that's a lot easier</u>
<u n="605" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="606" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I think</u>
<u n="607" who="S0144">no it's easier for us as well</u>
<u n="608" who="S0024">yeah it feels easier</u>
<u n="609" who="S0144">it's silly</u>
<u n="610" who="S0024">even though we've still got to do the house hunting and all of that <pause dur="short"/> in a different language that we can't speak or read</u>
<u n="611" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="612" who="S0024">it still seems <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I I think for us it would be quite easy here to find a house and stuff</u>
<u n="613" who="S0144">well I dunno all the paperwork <pause dur="short"/> you've got to give like five years of references</u>
<u n="614" who="S0024">mm mm</u>
<u n="615" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="616" who="S0024">crazy isn't it</u>
<u n="617" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was thinking about that the other day <pause dur="short"/> you know how like all these countries have got a brain drain</u>
<u n="618" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="619" who="S0144">that's going to start happening here</u>
<u n="620" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="621" who="S0144">where you know the most intelligent people are just gonna bugger off somewhere else</u>
<u n="622" who="S0024">I dunno actually <pause dur="short"/> they might bugger off to Germany or somewhere</u>
<u n="623" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="624" who="S0024">but if the <pause dur="short"/> the most intelligent people have got a quite a well paid job <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="625" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well no I mean intelligence as in kind of um I dunno people who are I dunno innovative</u>
<u n="626" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="627" who="S0144">the cutting edge of science <pause dur="short"/> developing new stuff</u>
<u n="628" who="S0024">well a lot of the people who are coming out of uni or doing a masters or something can't actually find work because of all the You should do a voluntary year and not get paid before you start <pause dur="short"/> and they haven't got any money</u>
<u n="629" who="S0144">hm</u>
<u n="630" who="S0024">how tempting is that to go and work abroad</u>
<u n="631" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="632" who="S0024">and get the money first <pause dur="short"/> and that's your experience and your money <pause dur="short"/> so yeah maybe you're right</u>
<u n="633" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but whether they'll need them <pause dur="short"/> cos I mean countries like India and China <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure they're you know producing enough of their own people</u>
<u n="634" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="635" who="S0144">to do stuff like that <pause dur="short"/> anyway</u>
<u n="636" who="S0024">but when when they have brain draining and people go over and stud abroad or work abroad then it's more likely that they're gonna get experience now <pause dur="short"/> in England <pause dur="short"/> and then move back to their home country</u>
<u n="637" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="638" who="S0024">rather than stay here</u>
<u n="639" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's true</u>
<u n="640" who="S0024">so those countries won't be losing</u>
<u n="641" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="642" who="S0024">as many intelligent people <pause dur="short"/> cos they'll all come back</u>
<u n="643" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="644" who="S0024">which is what they're supposed to do anyway <pause dur="short"/> if they're subsidised by the government</u>
<u n="645" who="S0144">well they're supposed to but</u>
<u n="646" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="647" who="S0144">I dunno <pause dur="short"/> especially with England it's quite easy to stay isn't it after a while so</u>
<u n="648" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="649" who="S0144">although</u>
