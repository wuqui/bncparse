<u n="1" who="S0115">what are you making?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0037">well I was thinking about making a little hat <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>um</trunc></u>
<u n="3" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="4" who="S0037">the problem with me is that</u>
<u n="5" who="S0115" trans="overlap">such as that one? Yeah it looks very stripy and complicated</u>
<u n="6" who="S0037">I don't really like the pointy bit on the end of that though I think it looks a bit stupid <pause dur="short"/> Do you know what I mean? Can</u>
<u n="7" who="S0115">like like a  like a  pixie or something</u>
<u n="8" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but um</u>
<u n="9" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0037">but the problem is like I <trunc>n</trunc> like <pause dur="short"/> cos I like <trunc>littin</trunc> knitting on these needles <pause dur="short"/> these don't <pause dur="short"/> like when you when your knitting needles I'll have like um an end on them <pause dur="short"/> like normal knitting needles <pause dur="short"/> they tell you what size they are <pause dur="short"/> so like can see the needles in the jar <pause dur="short"/> like <pause dur="short"/> in the jar</u>
<u n="11" who="S0115">uh yeah I can see some one with ones with a point and I can see some ones with obviously the flat bit at the end <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah and I see that one there is uh is double pointed at both ends yeah?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0037" trans="overlap">so like those ones <pause dur="short"/> so those ones tell you what size they are but these ones don't so <pause dur="short"/> I think you can get like er um</u>
<u n="13" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes it's six <trunc>m</trunc> six millimetres that one</u>
<u n="14" who="S0037">so you can get like a gage but I haven't got one where you can put your needle in and it tells you what size you're knitting on</u>
<u n="15" who="S0115" trans="overlap">that's the <trunc>th</trunc> the diameter</u>
<u n="16" who="S0037">but I haven't got one yet so I just try and find ones that look about right</u>
<u n="17" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0037">like this one says use three and three quarter <trunc>nee</trunc> needles <pause dur="short"/> but I don't know what size that needle is <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember <pause dur="short"/> I've bought that many</u>
<u n="19" who="S0115">well if this is six point six then <pause dur="short"/> so if this is six then that this one that one's probably like sort of half it's probably three isn't it?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah I know <pause dur="short"/> but they go in like I I know but they go in like quarter <pause dur="short"/> like three and three and three quarters three and one quarter three and a half</u>
<u n="21" who="S0115" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> you can't do the precise</u>
<u n="22" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it's like you can't tell <pause dur="short"/> anyway as a</u>
<u n="23" who="S0115" trans="overlap">you can actually <pause dur="short"/> but you'd have to get sort of measure it across with a</u>
<u n="24" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I need one of those what are they called? Me dad's got one like um</u>
<u n="25" who="S0115" trans="overlap">not not a <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> not just a ruler? A ruler wouldn't do it then?</u>
<u n="26" who="S0037">no it's like a pincer thing do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="27" who="S0115">oh those things yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0037">it's like for measuring really small</u>
<u n="29" who="S0115">but um <pause dur="short"/> you could sort of hold it above the ruler and look</u>
<u n="30" who="S0037" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> maybe</u>
<u n="31" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0037">be pretty hard though</u>
<u n="33" who="S0115" trans="overlap">be a bit  be a bit be a bit  annoying</u>
<u n="34" who="S0037" trans="overlap">just to see like a quarter of a millimetre <pause dur="short"/> You know whatever it is</u>
<u n="35" who="S0115">yeah you'd have to be very uh</u>
<u n="36" who="S0037" trans="overlap">three and a quarter millimetres versus three and a half <pause dur="short"/> anyway <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="37" who="S0115" trans="overlap">you'd have to hold it very <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0037" trans="overlap">and I just sort of tend to start and then just see like is it does it look right? That's why the things always come out a tiny bit different to how they look in the picture</u>
<u n="39" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and so you think that that one <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="40" who="S0037">and I never buy the right wool like you're supposed to knit it in like really</u>
<u n="41" who="S0115">yeah all <trunc>d</trunc> different <trunc>asp</trunc> uh yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0037" trans="overlap">all different like <trunc>th</trunc> thicknesses and stuff I just have what <trunc>s</trunc> use what ever I've just whatever I've just got hanging around</u>
<u n="43" who="S0115" trans="overlap">you <pause dur="short"/> so that's uh that's a baby's hat is it?</u>
<u n="44" who="S0037">so I was thinking about knitting a little hat so I've done booties and a jumper</u>

<u n="46" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and booties</u>
<u n="47" who="S0115" trans="overlap">you've done boots and you've got a hat</u>
<u n="48" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but <pause dur="short"/> there's loads of really lovely patterns like hang on where's that one?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0115">then you need some trousers</u>
<u n="50" who="S0037" trans="overlap">there's a <trunc>real</trunc> there's a really nice like <pause dur="short"/> like there's not that much stuff for little little babies so I might have to start knitting bigger things but <pause dur="short"/> there's stuff where it's like um really nice but it's quite girly <pause dur="short"/> like them for example <pause dur="short"/> they're really pretty but</u>
<u n="51" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0037">like if it's a boy they're not gonna like <pause dur="short"/> and like that as well like that's a lovely little cardigan can</u>
<u n="53" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0037">but like <pause dur="short"/> You know what I mean?</u>

<u n="57" who="S0115">yeah that's got a lot of  lot of  bits hasn't it?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0037" trans="overlap">if it's a little boy he's not gonna be <pause dur="short"/> not gonna be dressing him in that are they?</u>
<u n="59" who="S0115">um <pause dur="short"/> no they wouldn't unless unless they were short of</u>
<u n="60" who="S0037" trans="overlap">so I'm just sticking to like bright colours for now anyway</u>
<u n="61" who="S0115" trans="overlap">unless they were short of clothes</u>
<u n="62" who="S0037">well yeah but</u>
<u n="63" who="S0115" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="64" who="S0037">and that's so like that's another thing <pause dur="short"/> I'm just knitting in like bright colours or white really so <pause dur="short"/> it's um</u>
<u n="65" who="S0115">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but it's alright <pause dur="short"/> but some of <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="67" who="S0115" trans="overlap">works with both doesn't it? Yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0037" trans="overlap">there's some really good stuff like I <trunc>w</trunc> looked at some like websites and there's like um <pause dur="short"/> there's ones where it's like um like Goth knitting and like um really sort of weird uh like um <pause dur="short"/> how can I <trunc>c</trunc> say?

<u n="75" who="S0115">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah um</u>
<u n="76" who="S0037">that would be pretty cool</u>
<u n="77" who="S0115"><unclear/> so it's uh pretty popular then is is the knitting uh for babies? I mean do do do all babies have uh stuff knitted for them? What what happens if?</u>
<u n="78" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I think <pause dur="short"/> I don't know about <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure</u>
<u n="79" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's no one knitting anything?</u>
<u n="80" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I mean like my family knit a lot like that's why I knit</u>
<u n="81" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0037">but I don't know about other people</u>
<u n="83" who="S0115" trans="overlap">Cos it's popular</u>
<u n="84" who="S0037">I mean some people think it's chavvy <pause dur="short"/> like I was telling you like</u>
<u n="85" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0037">some people <trunc>w</trunc> don't want <trunc>knit</trunc> knitted fancy baby knitted things cos they think it makes their baby look like a baby chav <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="87" who="S0115" trans="overlap">but <pause dur="short"/> but I would've thought that that</u>
<u n="88" who="S0037" trans="overlap">like those lazy socks as well do you know those?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0115" trans="overlap">wouldn't wouldn't a sort of peasant baby be less likely to have uh like <trunc>clo</trunc> clothes that its family had made I mean</u>
<u n="90" who="S0037" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> but maybe it's just at home like maybe it's just like in Sunderland like some of the babies like you know you see tiny babies with ears pierced for example or like um</u>
<u n="91" who="S0115">alright</u>
<u n="92" who="S0037">those socks on you know those socks those really frilly socks with loads of lace?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0115">um</u>
<u n="94" who="S0037">like that was really chavvy or like</u>
<u n="95" who="S0115">really?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0037">yeah I mean just a bit over the top <pause dur="short"/> so and I sort of see the point like it can look a bit like rough but</u>
<u n="97" who="S0115" trans="overlap">uh <trunc>n</trunc> no I don't think that knitted clothes look in the slightest bit um either poor or garishly uh</u>
<u n="98" who="S0037" trans="overlap">maybe you need to <pause dur="short"/> if you saw them in the context <pause dur="short"/> no I don't think so either</u>
<u n="99" who="S0115" trans="overlap">or <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>ch</trunc> sort of uh um urban slum dwelling babies I don't think <trunc>u</trunc> to me uh knitting doesn't look uh chavvy at all so</u>
<u n="100" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no well I don't think so but I think it depends</u>
<u n="101" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0037">I think like anything could look chavvy though couldn't it really?</u>
<u n="103" who="S0115" trans="overlap">not things that are sort of frumpy uh so much</u>
<u n="104" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="105" who="S0115"><trunc>N</trunc> not so <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>u</trunc> it I mean it <trunc>w</trunc> suppose it <pause dur="short"/> if you're  if you're  talking about poor</u>
<u n="106" who="S0037" trans="overlap">do you think boys wear?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0115" trans="overlap">if you're talking chavvy is it talking chavvy meaning poor or if you're talking chavvy meaning um uh garish <trunc>l</trunc> sort of wealthy but ignorant sort of different sense of the word</u>
<u n="108" who="S0037" trans="overlap">do you think boys wear hats? I mean <pause dur="short"/> boys wear hats? Do you think boys wear purple? I mean I like it but do you think there would?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> it depends doesn't it I mean why? Because?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0037" trans="overlap">do you think it's suitably like unisex?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0115" trans="overlap">Cos <pause dur="short"/> well the babies wear <trunc>ev</trunc> everything don't they cos they just get they just wear what they're given don't they?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know but</u>
<u n="113" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I mean  I mean  they people aren't always that choosy about what they put on a baby are they? Or are or some of them might be I mean</u>
<u n="114" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> is it not because like sometimes when babies are first born they just look like <trunc>any</trunc> like you can't tell what sex they are so like their mams and dads dress them in like blue so it doesn't go isn't he lovely? and then they have to go it's a girl <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="115" who="S0115">yeah well I think</u>
<u n="116" who="S0037">but someone was telling me <pause dur="short"/> don't know if this is right but in the Victorian times they were the other way around like boys wore pink</u>
<u n="117" who="S0115">oh yeah is that sort of something like I think it was QI was it or was it?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0037" trans="overlap">was it you telling me that?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0115">uh where they said that yeah it used to be men <trunc>u</trunc> uh boy uh they considered pink more masculine <pause dur="short"/> perhaps cos it was red I don't know</u>
<u n="120" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0115">and then blue uh more feminine in uh Victorian times according to think it was QI</u>
<u n="122" who="S0037">uh-huh</u>
<u n="123" who="S0115">um which is surprising for a lot of people now <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing about QI it gives you things that it sort of likes to go against your expectations doesn't it</u>
<u n="124" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0115">uh urban myths or uh commonly held misconceptions or whatever that um that uh that's the point of QI but uh</u>
<u n="126" who="S0037">it'd be good to be a researcher wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah I mean I I don't really understand how they why they always have fixed colours for for different you know things but</u>
<u n="128" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="129" who="S0115">I I think everyone should wear every colour but  that's just  that's just me <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="130" who="S0037">yeah but I mean</u>
<u n="131" who="S0115">there's a lot of  there's a lot of  crazy possibilities I suppose <pause dur="short"/> you don't wanna be too too bright brightly coloured</u>
<u n="132" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I like the brightly coloured things like the jazzy stuff but I mean I don't know if <pause dur="short"/> I suppose babies just be sick and do poos all the time I mean I suppose  I suppose  people don't they'll just need lots of stuff won't they?</u>
<u n="133" who="S0115">yeah I guess they um they have loads and loads of <trunc>cha</trunc> they have <trunc>man</trunc> multiple changes <trunc>in</trunc> per day</u>
<u n="134" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0115">so um <pause dur="short"/> it's not like a sort of older um child maybe or not a teenager where they would only need like one thing to wear or uh plus plus the school school uniforms and</u>
<u n="136" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I don't know everyone likes a bit costume change Lady Gaga style <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="137" who="S0115">yeah I don't know much about Lady Gaga really</u>
