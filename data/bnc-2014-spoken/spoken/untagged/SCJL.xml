<u n="1" who="S0078">okay so I started for my project I wanted to do something completely different from what I ended up doing <pause dur="short"/> but I got to like a week or two before it was due and I just hadn't learnt the programming language that I needed to <pause dur="short"/> to write this game em that I  that I  wanted to do for my project <pause dur="short"/> but I had something else in mind at the same time and so I'd been sort of working on this sort of in the background and it was actually some building projects based in a game called Minecraft</u>
<u n="2" who="S0045">I know Minecraft</u>
<u n="3" who="S0078">and em <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and eh so I've I've joined the <anon type="place"/> Gaming Society and they have a <pause dur="short"/> they're a Minecraft server <pause dur="short"/> and I did some projects there <pause dur="short"/> em one of the projects I wanted to do was a a big statue and based on what I'd heard from em well <pause dur="short"/> before I started the course</u>
<u n="4" who="S0045">yeah</u>
<u n="5" who="S0078">I did a Google search for one of my lecturers and eh managed to find a video of him eh talking to someone sort of for an  for an  event</u>
<u n="6" who="S0045">oh right</u>
<u n="7" who="S0078">and he was talking about the concept that he was exploring in his art work <pause dur="short"/> and it's a thing called cyber provincialism which is kind of the the it's exploring the concept that online even though you're potentially connected to everyone in the world <pause dur="short"/> there's a tendency for people to be closed off and create their own close knit communities and</u>
<u n="8" who="S0045">yeah I see yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0078">and and imitate works of art and bits of culture that that's quite local to them <pause dur="short"/> and so you'll get sort of small quaint villages <unclear/></u>
<u n="10" who="S0045">oh right so you sort of get <trunc>s</trunc> so you sort of get things that kind of yeah I guess localised</u>
<u n="11" who="S0078">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so you you got a potential for these vast metropolises filled with loads of like diverse em cultures and backgrounds and stuff but you end up getting these close communities <pause dur="short"/> em so I wanted to explore that idea and and <pause dur="short"/> in the video at the end when asked how what what would be the <trunc>o</trunc> role of an artist em to to explore this idea or to confront it <pause dur="short"/> and em he suggested that perhaps the artist could expand em sort of enlarge the the garden gnome to the size of the statue of liberty or something just just poke fun of out of it <pause dur="short"/> and em so so that that was part of the reasoning for this first art project that I was going to do <pause dur="short"/> em and entering into of course what I thought I was going to be doing which was creative education they asked us to get completely obsessed with something just one particular theme</u>
<u n="12" who="S0045">oh right</u>
<u n="13" who="S0078">just to explore what it was to to get obsessed <pause dur="short"/> and eh I'd recently bought Minecraft so I decided I'd go for that and just learn absolutely everything about it <pause dur="short"/> and em eh something that came across when I was looking at bits and bobs is that a lot of people on Minecraft servers are in their own little worlds they tend to make these monuments to Mario <pause dur="short"/> it's a  It's a  very easy statue to make <pause dur="short"/> there's there's pixel art of Mario and it <trunc>ha</trunc> happens all the time <pause dur="short"/> so I had sort of combined those ideas in my head and thought it would be a bit of fun to make a sort of combination of a garden gnome the statue of liberty and super Mario</u>
<u n="14" who="S0045">oh wow</u>
<u n="15" who="S0078">in eh on on the server <pause dur="short"/> and eh so when I announced it to people that sort of got excited about it and sort of made an island for it to sit on and eh some people were trying thought they might make a little sort of hidden illuminati style base <unclear/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0045">wow</u>
<u n="17" who="S0078">and I got a bit of help in in the building but it was quite a complex design <pause dur="short"/> because rather than just being a 2D pixel art I sort of got gave it some depth and I looked up some Super Mario three em pixel art <pause dur="short"/> and so I got the side and the front and sort of merged them together gave him a pointy beard and a pointy hat and and gave him a torch and the tabula em ansata or whatever it's called <pause dur="short"/> the declaration of independence thing that the statue of liberty holds</u>
<u n="18" who="S0045">how long did it take to actually make em you know the the the actual statue itself?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0078">em well the first time I in in designing it in Mine craft you've got a thing call creative mode work that allows you to fly around and you have infinite resources <pause dur="short"/> so it's quite easy to make these things <pause dur="short"/> but em in building on the server eh I was in survival mode of I had to mine my own resources <pause dur="short"/> but eh one of the guys who had em em modulator</u>
<u n="20" who="S0045">yeah mods</u>
<u n="21" who="S0078">yeah he he was a mod so</u>
<u n="22" who="S0045">yeah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0078">so he he was basically in creative so he could give me all the resources that I needed <pause dur="short"/> em so I've sort of got maybe about half way through it and em and someone asked me why is it a gnome? Why isn't it just Mario? And I was sort of like eh this is it's supposed to be a sort of artistic statement about cyber provincialism <pause dur="short"/> and he said why can't it just be fun? I was like mm <pause dur="short"/> well it is still kind of fun but it kind of shoved it down a bit for me <pause dur="short"/> so I left it for ages and then</u>
<u n="24" who="S0045">yeah you know <unclear/> kind of morph them cos it's taking bits of different cultures as opposed to being what's the word like <trunc>ins</trunc> insular and isolated</u>
<u n="25" who="S0078">yeah well it was just sort of combining those ideas <pause dur="short"/> I don't think it was particularly well justified in the end it was just a little bit of nonsense <pause dur="short"/> so that was em that was one idea and I did come back to it and finish it eventually <pause dur="short"/> em <pause dur="short"/> so the well the module the name of the module was art and social networking <pause dur="short"/> so I one of the ideas that I had to eh build in Minecraft was em <pause dur="short"/> cut me off when it's been fifteen minutes <pause dur="short"/> was eh eh if you make the ground out of a certain material</u>
<u n="26" who="S0045">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0078">then it's not em it it lights up when you tread on it but it doesn't produce enough light for the eh monsters to not spawn</u>
<u n="28" who="S0045">oh I see no you're right okay</u>
<u n="29" who="S0078">yeah so I I decided it would be a good idea to have this massive arena made out of red stone</u>
<u n="30" who="S0045">mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0078">and close it off so that the sunlight didn't get on it so these monsters would spawn in this arena <pause dur="short"/> and you could just go and fight them and there'd be enough lighting that you'd see and the light the floor would light up as they were these monsters were walking around on it <pause dur="short"/> and em people really got behind that <pause dur="short"/> and it was a really simple design <pause dur="short"/> it was em it was just a dome so it was quite easy to figure out how to do it <pause dur="short"/> and the floor was just a circle of red stone so loads of people were really keen to to help out and help me make this <pause dur="short"/> and it was fairly close to where everyone was doing their business and building their things <pause dur="short"/> and it also from a distance it just looked bloody huge <pause dur="short"/> eh I called it the desert dome because there's just this massive sandy desert and then in the middle there's this stone dome just standing there</u>
<u n="32" who="S0045">big arena kind of thing</u>
<u n="33" who="S0078">yeah it it's really quite striking <pause dur="short"/> and people you know not only did they help out but they really sort of put their own creativity into it <pause dur="short"/> there was em someone made a rail link from the the main city where everyone was</u>
<u n="34" who="S0045">oh wow</u>
<u n="35" who="S0078">out to this place <pause dur="short"/> em someone made eh someone wanted to make a mechanical doorway for it <pause dur="short"/> em unfortunately the creeper the em exploding monsters kept on blowing it up and they got quite upset about that</u>
<u n="36" who="S0045">love it</u>
<u n="37" who="S0078">and eh em the the creepers em don't burn in the sunlight <pause dur="short"/> so if you get chased out by a creeper it will carry on following you <pause dur="short"/> so someone decided to make a eh sort of sanctuary tower that you could really escape from the creepers in <pause dur="short"/> and some one sort of decorated the inside of the dome with lights and someone em eh placed a bunch of eh sort of little lights around where you could find a little space for respite and caves where you could repair your health and stuff <pause dur="short"/> and em yeah I'd sort of heard I didn't see every time someone used it <pause dur="short"/> but you could tell like by the time that server had finished that that map had finished there were sort of loads of holes all over the place because people had been using it</u>
<u n="38" who="S0045">excellent</u>
<u n="39" who="S0078">so yeah yeah that was  that was  a much more em positive project that actually worked out quite well</u>
<u n="40" who="S0045">yeah it's quite nice when you see it sort of evolve as well</u>
<u n="41" who="S0078">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0045">cos I guess it's something <pause dur="short"/> it's it's a bit like em it's a bit like the sort of  mass effect games where you sort of you know you're given an idea and you've got you know the develop a crazy idea but then people kind of retake it themselves</u>
<u n="43" who="S0078" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> so um the there was the third thing that I did em which I didn't even realise would take off as much as it did <pause dur="short"/> but the reason I came up with this last idea was em on the map with the desert down in the Mario statue eh there was a little bit of em vandalism going on <pause dur="short"/> and I just and and quite a lot of stealing as well <pause dur="short"/> and I just thought it would  it would  lessen the blow on individuals and there'd be a lot more of a community spirit if we just shared all of our resources <pause dur="short"/> apart from our most valuable resources which you'd have to hide nicely but <pause dur="short"/> em the the things like em dirt and wood and sand and and meat and stuff would be completely communal</u>
<u n="44" who="S0045">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0078">and you'd have your eh your enchanting table and your your forge and your brewery and stuff where everyone could just use these resources <pause dur="short"/> so erm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0045" trans="overlap">it's kind of like a virtual communist state</u>
<u n="47" who="S0078">yeah yeah it really was <pause dur="short"/> so em I found the most obvious place on the  map after the last one had been diluted because eh version one point O came out <pause dur="short"/> em so I went to the coordinate zero zero <pause dur="short"/> and started building this town <pause dur="short"/> and there's this eh there's this one guy on the server that was a bit too keen <pause dur="short"/> just spent hours and hours and hours playing on it <pause dur="short"/> and I just sort of set up the basics and he made it look beautiful <pause dur="short"/> we had a communal mine as well which which was really nice <pause dur="short"/> and em to to keep the animals as well <pause dur="short"/> eh just wanted sort of little fence pens but this guy made a huge huge great barn</u>
<u n="48" who="S0045">oh wow</u>
<u n="49" who="S0078">and eh <pause dur="short"/> yeah it it everyone really enjoyed it and they were still able to em sort of build their own little houses around it well quite massive houses but yeah <pause dur="short"/> they were able to em because all of the communal buildings were lined up on this street it it was quite a go do focal point for everyone else to build this stuff <pause dur="short"/> em and eh one of the things that em got a lot of attention and a lot of er creative input from people was on December the first I made a huge great naked Christmas tree <pause dur="short"/> and just posted the picture of this naked <trunc>fi</trunc> Christmas tree up onto Facebook and instantly people were on there sort of decorating and putting presents around the bottom and stuff <pause dur="short"/> and em and that was great <pause dur="short"/> and there was this eh there was one guy who built a castle a little distance away from it and he was inviting people to come and do a bit of player versus player with him <pause dur="short"/> and eh no one really went for it <pause dur="short"/> so yeah kind of  kind of  felt bad for him but then there was a little bit of vandalism and sort of stealing going on em</u>
<u n="50" who="S0045">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0078">and then eventually I think round about the Christmas holidays the whole place just got completely burnt to shit</u>
<u n="52" who="S0045">oh no</u>
<u n="53" who="S0078">there was lava <pause dur="short"/> this this guy had burnt down the Christmas tree <pause dur="short"/> who does that? It's just mental</u>
<u n="54" who="S0045">it's just mankind isn't it?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0078">yeah it was just really really weird and he  and he  sent a sort of statement to the <anon type="place"/> Gaming Society saying you guys are all em  hold hands and let's be best friends forever and stuff and gaming isn't about that it's about competition <pause dur="short"/> and it was like no it <trunc>c</trunc> it's just having fun <pause dur="short"/> this guy was just psycho he was just really weird <pause dur="short"/> em so that's that's what happened to that and I stopped playing Minecraft shortly after em yeah <pause dur="short"/> how are we doing? Yeah okay <pause dur="short"/> em so yeah I spoke to em I sort of I gave a talk about all of this to em my class and em they yeah <pause dur="short"/> they were really interested in this guy who who had attacked everyone else and sort of <trunc>las</trunc> lashed out because he couldn't cos he couldn't get his player versus player experience that he wanted <pause dur="short"/> he was hoping to sort of prod people into turning on each other before but instead it just sort of had the opposite effect because on the next one instead of sort of thinking okay from now on it's going to be player versus player <pause dur="short"/> I'm going to keep all my resources I'm not going to let anyone near them and set up trash and everything <pause dur="short"/> instead <pause dur="short"/> eh because I actually did set up some traps <unclear/> on the first map like I had my storage bunker underneath my house and if you dropped down you'd fall in to some lava <pause dur="short"/> and then the next time I went there he'd destroyed the em barrier around the lava the lava had escaped and just burnt all of my resources</u>
<u n="56" who="S0045">oh no</u>
<u n="57" who="S0078">so I guess that's my own bloody fault but em</u>
<u n="58" who="S0045">Jesus</u>
<u n="59" who="S0078">so in the next map I hope that I killed him before he'd figured out he could do that <pause dur="short"/> em but yeah in the next <trunc>m</trunc> map I just went completely the opposite direction</u>
<u n="60" who="S0045">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0078">and it caused him to just just go completely the other direction as well <pause dur="short"/> he just completely just lost it <pause dur="short"/> em so when I explained this to my class they were really sort of intrigued by this idea <pause dur="short"/> and em and then in the write up I explained that em my my original idea about em eh eh cyber provincialism which was the concept that sort of started the whole building in Minecraft em project <pause dur="short"/> em at first it was like em <pause dur="short"/> when I first heard about it I was think maybe em the idea is that these people in their game worlds had sort of closed off from the real world <pause dur="short"/> but that wasn't so much the case because there were things that enter into the Minecraft universe that are factors in the real world <pause dur="short"/> like there was em occupy Wall Street and occupy London and stuff like that</u>
<u n="62" who="S0045">oh they actually did versions of it?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0078">em well when Minecraft one point zero was released there was MineCon which was the em the sort of convention in eh Las Vegas</u>
<u n="64" who="S0045">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0078">and the group who were televising it were recording everything and stuff em were wearing occupy Minecraft t-shirts <pause dur="short"/> and there was a lot of discussion apparently according to one of these journalists who covered it <pause dur="short"/> em there was a lot of discussion about how they can bring the occupy movement into Minecraft and sort of enthuse everyone because it's quite quite a connected community the Minecraft community with the creative projects that go on <pause dur="short"/> and em when Steve Jobs passed away the someone put em built a massive eh sign in the main eh the village on one of the maps R I P Steve Jobs and sort of did a iPod thing and and drew made a iPod out of blocks <pause dur="short"/> and em so so news does have a way of getting in so <pause dur="short"/> that that that's one part of cyber provincialism that em that one way of looking at it that that I considered <pause dur="short"/> em another was eh bringing various communities eh no the getting a community to to look at different cultures</u>
<u n="66" who="S0045">mm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0078">and there was an example that that really inspired me in the first place of em a YouTube channel where they em eh this this guy who presents the show eh gets everyone on his Minecraft server to to build over the course of a week or a month to em on a certain subject <pause dur="short"/> so like for once it's been a western theme so they've build a load of western towns and stuff and eh references to Back to the Future three and stuff like that</u>
<u n="68" who="S0045">oh excellent</u>
<u n="69" who="S0078">and eh they did one em Far East they did one of underwater worlds they did one of the future <pause dur="short"/> em and that's one way of sort of brining in other cultures</u>
<u n="70" who="S0045">oh wow</u>
<u n="71" who="S0078">and making it sort of expanding the world and and really making it a bit more international <pause dur="short"/> em and and then it's funny how it ended up being eh a bit of an explanation of these these clashes of cultures <pause dur="short"/> in in that guy who thought it was all about player versus player he he found himself locked in this this province that he didn't feel he belonged to and and he just he couldn't cope with it</u>
<u n="72" who="S0045">so he had to destroy it</u>
<u n="73" who="S0078">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so eh <pause dur="short"/> sort of</u>
<u n="74" who="S0045">read Lord of the Flies</u>
<u n="75" who="S0078">all all came round like that <pause dur="short"/> em so yeah since then em <pause dur="short"/> I had a bit of a scare about worrying that I was getting addicted to video games and not really paying attention to to really doing artistic projects out outside of Minecraft or outside of video games <pause dur="short"/> em so I quit playing Minecraft for a bit but I've sort of been in there once or twice since and eh that that guy that builds that built the em eh that built the massive barn</u>
<u n="76" who="S0045">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0078">he has built these massive projects and it they haven't been as collaborative as they were before so <pause dur="short"/> I I went back on recently and sort of joined in for a little bit and I'm going to build this massive tower <pause dur="short"/> but em I really wanted to wait to involve a lot more people <pause dur="short"/> so I made a couple of sort of teeny little challenges <pause dur="short"/> because when I was trying this this tower thing we got the guy who gave me the resources for the Mario statue em he help <trunc>bui</trunc> em dig a massive hole eh so that we'd have the tower from Bedrock all the way up to the very top <pause dur="short"/> so it would be the biggest possible tower <pause dur="short"/> so he made loads of channels with dynamite em and we built these walls up so that the water couldn't get through cos it was for some reason we decided to build it on the coast <pause dur="short"/> we walled up the eh water and then there's this guy making channels of dynamite and eh <trunc>a</trunc> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the guy who was em who I was helping he said it's alright <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> knows what he's doing he's he's an expert with TNT <pause dur="short"/> he know he knows where the <unclear/> is and I trust him <pause dur="short"/> and I was sort of getting further and further away going yeah <pause dur="short"/> you trust him <pause dur="short"/> and lo and behold he completely blew up the walls the whole thing was just completely flooded <pause dur="short"/> and em so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> asked him nicely if we could have creative mode <pause dur="short"/> so we got the resources we were able to fly we built up the wall again and eh he it was only supposed to be for one day and em <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has had creative taken away from him but for whatever reason <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and none of the other mods have taken it away from me <pause dur="short"/> so I've built some sort of puzzle challenges and stuck them up on Facebook for for people to have a go at and em sort of built them in eh using creative modes and that's yeah it's just another way of trying to bring people together using Minecraft and creative projects and yeah</u>
