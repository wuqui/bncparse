<u n="19" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0091">turn right <pause dur="short"/> and at the bottom of the hill turn right again</u>

<u n="27" who="S0179"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="28" who="S0058">it's little legs were <vocal desc="laugh"/> really er going</u>

<u n="46" who="S0179">which isn't dreadfully helpful</u>
<u n="47" who="S0058">no <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="48" who="S0179">I think the thirty speed limit through this village is a bit optimistic <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0058">yes</u>
<u n="50" who="S0179">it's ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> for places they put twenty mile an hour speed limits</u>
<u n="51" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0179">in for no good reason <pause dur="short"/> and yet they feel the need to restrict you to thirty through here <pause dur="short"/> and then sorry don't</u>
<u n="53" who="S0058">so yeah <pause dur="short"/> not restrict you to twenty through here <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="64" who="S0179">I suppose so <pause dur="short"/> it's just the connotations it <unclear/></u>
<u n="65" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> no entirely</u>
<u n="66" who="S0179">it's it sort of subsequently obtained <pause dur="long"/> It's easier driving along here in winter <pause dur="short"/> cos the vegetation sort of lessened</u>

<u n="78" who="S0179">there we go <pause dur="short"/> not actually valets <pause dur="short"/> um give it a try <pause dur="short"/> I just don't think it's a particularly efficient use of twenty-five quid</u>
<u n="79" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0179">as in all I want is the inside vacuumed and the outside washed <pause dur="short"/> I mean we can do that very easily</u>
<u n="81" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> we can do that <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> true</u>
<u n="82" who="S0179">in the space of half an hour</u>
<u n="83" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0179">you know <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="85" who="S0058">fair enough</u>
<u n="86" who="S0179">it's just we haven't been at home much to do it recently</u>
<u n="87" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="88" who="S0179">but <trunc>tomorr</trunc></u>
<u n="89" who="S0058">I will hoover the car out tomorrow</u>
<u n="90" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> please <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0058">yeah I will</u>
<u n="92" who="S0179">to be honest it's now been so long I might do the outside <vocal desc="laugh"/> again</u>
<u n="93" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0179">there's a nice sort of ah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0058">hmm?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0179">who have we got um next week?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Excellent</u>
<u n="98" who="S0179">I think that's fair</u>
<u n="99" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> It's not a particularly horrible job</u>
<u n="100" who="S0179">exactly <pause dur="long"/> There's some stupid thing in this country about the speed limits <pause dur="short"/> so the speed limit along here is national <pause dur="short"/> and with that</u>
<u n="101" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0179">sort of admittedly I'm not seriously making progress but you know I'm sort of not been above fifty</u>
<u n="103" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="104" who="S0179">but yet on other roads it's exactly the same speed limit despite the fact that they're multiple lanes</u>
<u n="105" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> open <pause dur="short"/> clear</u>
<u n="106" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0058">no er <trunc>t</trunc> junctions <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but um you see the thing was um you know the road safety charity Brake?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0179">well let's guess what their main concern</u>
<u n="111" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="112" who="S0179">is going to be</u>
<u n="113" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="114" who="S0179">but again all of that's been there's <trunc>n</trunc> virtually no crossover to to um say the <unclear/> or <unclear/> Yet because um I suppose <unclear/> organizations <unclear/> solution is for driver training not for reducing speed limits</u>
<u n="115" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0179">um <pause dur="short"/> and in most cases speed is er speed limit of road it's might be an aggravating factor in the severity of the accident but it doesn't cause it</u>
<u n="117" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="118" who="S0179">er driver error causes the accident</u>
<u n="119" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/>  how to drive safely at different speeds</u>
<u n="120" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> I mean ideally you'd live in a situation where there was no speed limit <pause dur="short"/> and people</u>
<u n="121" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0179">could be trusted to pick the appropriate speed for the set of circumstances <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="123" who="S0058">er you might need sort of signs saying warning this thing is coming up that you won't be able to see</u>
<u n="124" who="S0179">well exactly</u>
<u n="125" who="S0058">but</u>
<u n="126" who="S0179">you would need sort of accepted guidance</u>
<u n="127" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0179">um <pause dur="short"/> well no <pause dur="short"/> what it should have is suggested speed limits</u>
<u n="129" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0179">but the optimum</u>
<u n="131" who="S0058">and you're you're penalised for driving dangerously not for</u>
<u n="132" who="S0179">breaking the limit</u>
<u n="133" who="S0058">the speed <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0179">and that may well be the same thing</u>
<u n="135" who="S0058">yes <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0179">but</u>
<u n="137" who="S0058">that's what I mean <pause dur="short"/> but sometimes they're not</u>
<u n="138" who="S0179">yes <unclear/></u>
<u n="139" who="S0058">like you said sometimes it's safer to</u>
<u n="140" who="S0091">left <pause dur="short"/> left at the top</u>
<u n="141" who="S0179">yep <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> There are many situations in which it's acceptable</u>
<u n="142" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0179">or indeed <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> well that was leisurely</u>
<u n="144" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Nice day for a cycle</u>
<u n="145" who="S0179">he looked very happy didn't he <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="146" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well <pause dur="short"/> nice to be out on your bike</u>
<u n="147" who="S0179">er indeed <pause dur="long"/> Um we got from  to here one bar of fuel <pause dur="short"/> that's impressive</u>
<u n="148" who="S0058">nice</u>
<u n="149" who="S0179">efficient little car</u>
<u n="150" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> That's pretty good <pause dur="short"/> does well</u>
<u n="151" who="S0179">so light it's scary</u>
<u n="152" who="S0058">so what?</u>
<u n="153" who="S0179">so light it's scary</u>

<u n="312" who="S0058">ah</u>
