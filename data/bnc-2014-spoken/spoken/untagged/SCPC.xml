<u n="745" who="S0252">oh</u>
<u n="746" who="S0251" trans="overlap">why is it different?</u>
<u n="747" who="S0369">cos they don't like doing things simple I think</u>
<u n="748" who="S0252">I their reason is that they try to choose what most people would academics would write</u>

<u n="754" who="S0252">er er referencing and specify that</u>
<u n="755" who="S0251">mm</u>

<u n="766" who="S0252" trans="overlap">one particular style is that there's a little number that they've above</u>

<u n="768" who="S0252" trans="overlap">what somebody's said</u>
<u n="769" who="S0368">yes</u>
<u n="770" who="S0252">erm another way could be that in the text there's a bracket with the name of the author a comma and then the date that book</u>

<u n="775" who="S0368" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="776" who="S0252">at the back of the book you probably don't realise but there are actually different styles for example what do you actually include in a reference?</u>
<u n="777" who="S0368">yeah</u>
<u n="778" who="S0252" trans="overlap">so usually there's a minimum the author title is included but also if it's a journal you've got the title of the journal now which journal it's from</u>
<u n="779" who="S0368">yeah</u>
<u n="780" who="S0252" trans="overlap">so it could be titled er <unclear>Cadbury</unclear> and altruism and the journal is er Sage or</u>

<u n="804" who="S0368">mm</u>
<u n="805" who="S0252">there's a set rule generally there should be a set rule for each different style and if you get that slightly incorrect to be penalised in a an essay so</u>

<u n="881" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="882" who="S0252">it can get quite tricky for things like er one thing that tends to happen now is dictionaries tend to only be online now I I think Oxford er University Press don't seem to publish</u>

<u n="1490" who="S0252">mm</u>
<u n="1491" who="S0369">but you know these farmers they're er very military and</u>

<u n="1511" who="S0369">if you fit winter <trunc>t</trunc> now I don't know what winter tyres are but anyhow if you fit winter tyres you'd have none of this skidding or anything like that and he said er for a matter of about three hundred pound you could get the four wheels done and when spring comes take them off and put your others back on</u>
<u n="1512" who="S0251">yeah somebody in earlier said to me we've been trapped in the house for three days because of the snow this is our first time</u>
