<u n="1" who="S0607">of being a</u>
<u n="2" who="S0644">lawyer</u>
<u n="3" who="S0607">the clerk of a justice person yeah and in order to erm <pause dur="short"/> in order to erm</u>
<u n="4" who="S0644">oh</u>
<u n="5" who="S0607">I dunno if it'll work</u>
<u n="6" who="S0644">okay</u>
<u n="7" who="S0607">erm to to take up writing</u>
<u n="8" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0607">but I think I liked it because she had this thing erm and I did start doing you know and I <trunc>mi</trunc> when I get back from here I'm gonna try and enjoy not having anything to do for like a month because</u>
<u n="10" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0607">before we came here I was quite fixated on research for here and it was</u>
<u n="12" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0607">impending a bit more and more and more and there was like a deadline</u>
<u n="14" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="15" who="S0607">and there will be a deadline again cos I've got house-sitting from the third of April but that's a month of not having to do anything so one of the things I would like to do is to have this project <unclear>for me</unclear> again so I started it and all I remember is that she suggested that you make a list of the things that you like</u>
<u n="16" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0607">make a list of the things that you don't like</u>
<u n="18" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0607">but it's not I think it's phrased a bit better than that things that make you feel good things that make you feel bad and then things that make you feel in an atmosphere of growth erm cos she was like you can't just have all the things you like erm you have to have an atmosphere</u>
<u n="20" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0607">of growth or you don't you're not satisfied then</u>
<u n="22" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah yeah exactly</u>
<u n="23" who="S0607">and I remember how wonderful it was so I woke up one Sunday at like five AM</u>
<u n="24" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0607">and I got up</u>
<u n="26" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="27" who="S0607">and went on the patio and started making a list of what I liked</u>
<u n="28" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0607">and it was so much fun and then I remember <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> woke up at seven and we went to the outdoor pool</u>
<u n="30" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0607">and it was such a great day erm but then the idea was right so you've got to try and include more of the things that you like</u>
<u n="32" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0607">get rid of some of the things you don't like as far as you can</u>
<u n="34" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0607">and what are you gonna do for your atmosphere of growth? I bet there's more to it I'm just that's how I remember it so I started doing it and the thing is like I had a list of about eight hundred things that I liked</u>
<u n="36" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0607">so I couldn't you can't start doing them all so she had</u>
<u n="38" who="S0644" trans="overlap">like what? out of interest</u>
<u n="39" who="S0607">erm there was such a wide <trunc>ra</trunc> such shame I don't have the list</u>
<u n="40" who="S0644" trans="overlap">do you mean on a mundane level or up to bigger things? like from reading?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0607">all levels yeah like</u>
<u n="42" who="S0644" trans="overlap">reading swimming?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0607">waking up early</u>
<u n="44" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0607">swimming</u>
<u n="46" who="S0644">uhu</u>
<u n="47" who="S0607">erm coffee</u>
<u n="48" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0607">erm like it's a shame I don't have the list with me but it all like came to me that morning and I was just oh like fresh air</u>
<u n="50" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0607">erm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0644">simple things</u>
<u n="53" who="S0607">not being oh and then on the like what I don't like side being late</u>
<u n="54" who="S0644">uhu</u>
<u n="55" who="S0607">cos it just makes me feel like shit erm and other stuff like that so so then it was like she I then I just wished that she was there because she had this fabulous plan of twelve months and each month she was tackling particular bits</u>
<u n="56" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="57" who="S0607">and I just fell short there because I was working and I just didn't really have time</u>
<u n="58" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="59" who="S0607">and and you've got to be careful not to let it become a chore</u>
<u n="60" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0607">so because you're like holding yourself accountable that's how you're gonna get it done</u>
<u n="62" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0607">it's a danger that you end up going oh <vocal desc="sigh"/> I've got to like</u>
<u n="64" who="S0644" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="65" who="S0607">be on time and I've got to</u>
<u n="66" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0607">so and then ticking it off</u>
<u n="68" who="S0644">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0607">so I realised I'd done it wrong at first cos I'd ended up with a more jobs</u>
<u n="70" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="71" who="S0607">erm but I eventually got it right but by the way this is quite short lived so</u>
<u n="72" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0607">I chose which ones to do that month so I chose something like writing erm cooking and I dunno something else and then three things to get rid of</u>
<u n="74" who="S0644">yes</u>
<u n="75" who="S0607">and then I sort of like forgot about it for a bit but I I remember one day going oh crap I didn't do the thing and I looked back and I had been doing those things</u>
<u n="76" who="S0644">oh</u>
<u n="77" who="S0607">so it had</u>
<u n="78" who="S0644" trans="overlap">so it had it anyway?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0607">yeah it had infiltrated what</u>
<u n="80" who="S0644" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="81" who="S0607">I was doing</u>
<u n="82" who="S0644">right right right</u>
<u n="83" who="S0607">and I would like to do that again I know it's really like simple but it was so good cos I thought do you know what?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0644">effective</u>
<u n="85" who="S0607">I love going to a café and reading my books I'm gonna do that on Saturday</u>
<u n="86" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0607">rather than just going oh I never manage to get round to having the reading in the café thing</u>
<u n="88" who="S0644" trans="overlap">like make it an a purposeful thing?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah erm and then the thing with the atmosphere of growth is probably my writing</u>
<u n="90" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="91" who="S0607">so what do you think?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0644">excellent</u>
<u n="93" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0644">because erm what the theory of everything or the many books that I've read on the theory of everything as you know shall we come up here? erm dunno where I thought that was a part of the whole thing</u>
<u n="95" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0644">but erm what do you think? I mean</u>

<u n="100" who="S0644">I dunno</u>
<u n="101" who="S0607">or do you think we have to get back in the car <trunc>t</trunc><trunc>t</trunc>to go back to where you saw it before?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0644">maybe stick our heads round here</u>
<u n="103" who="S0607">and see</u>
<u n="104" who="S0644">see <trunc>wha</trunc></u>
<u n="105" who="S0607">and then yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0644" trans="overlap">if there's no sign then we'll have to maybe go back</u>
<u n="107" who="S0607" trans="overlap">go back and then see it again</u>
<u n="108" who="S0644">right so</u>
<u n="109" who="S0607" trans="overlap">whoops <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="110" who="S0644">no what I was gonna say to you</u>
<u n="111" who="S0607" trans="overlap">we're accidently just walking along a road <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="113" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0644">it's completely lovely erm right so what I was gonna say to you it sounds like a similar thing <pause dur="short"/> the theory of everything er one of the many erm tools you can use says every day at the end of your day write down at least three things <unclear>watch out there</unclear></u>
<u n="115" who="S0607">oh</u>
<u n="116" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0607">maybe this is what this is for</u>
<u n="118" who="S0644">it's it's <pause dur="short"/> that looks like loads of fun though doesn't it?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah oh polluting though</u>
<u n="120" who="S0644">oh erm yeah write down at the end of the day three things or four things that were really good</u>
<u n="121" who="S0607">oh yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0644">and then what happens is is you look back at your day and you think yeah that was a good day and that was really like this was nice and it makes you feel better then when you go to sleep</u>
<u n="123" who="S0607">and you maybe do find things where you thought</u>
<u n="124" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0607">that everything</u>
<u n="126" who="S0644" trans="overlap">well it</u>
<u n="127" who="S0607">had gone to shit but when you think about it there was a couple of things</u>
<u n="128" who="S0644">and the idea is this it's one of the methods you can use to cultivate a attitude that's a happier one</u>
<u n="129" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0644">you know? because <pause dur="short"/> that's what I'm saying erm <pause dur="short"/> that's what I'm saying as in you make your life what it is</u>
<u n="131" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="132" who="S0644">so if you make yourself and this is so true and I I don't mean to constantly bring up certain people but I have a friend who is very negative</u>
<u n="133" who="S0607"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="134" who="S0644">and everything is wrong</u>
<u n="135" who="S0607"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="136" who="S0644"><trunc>ever</trunc> yeah I <trunc>ha</trunc> I don't wanna say it on record</u>
<u n="137" who="S0607">I still like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> though</u>
<u n="138" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah I do she's she's fantastic but you know when you look at someone and you can see <pause dur="short"/> how this has come to be like it is?</u>
<u n="139" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0644" trans="overlap">like you can totally see how it's</u>
<u n="141" who="S0607">but I was getting like that definitely I was so negative</u>
<u n="142" who="S0644">well you you are not negative <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="143" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="144" who="S0644">cos this this is the problem with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> as well is that it's quite funny and then you end up laughing at it</u>
<u n="145" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0644">and then that becomes their personality personality cos they think oh</u>
<u n="147" who="S0607">it's funny</u>
<u n="148" who="S0644">it's funny when I'm like this so I'll do it more and everyone'll</u>

<u n="258" who="S0644">it's our fault well that's good cos that means we can do something about it</u>
<u n="259" who="S0607">cos on the one hand I kind of think it can't all be a holiday but I but on the other hand I think that's not what is meant it means that so for example when I was in Frankfurt I was like I don't want to live here and as much as possible go to Cornwall</u>
<u n="260" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="261" who="S0607">I want to live in Cornwall</u>
<u n="262" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="263" who="S0607">and I know that not everybody can live where they went on holiday but that's what my mum and dad did and I suddenly realised this one day</u>
<u n="264" who="S0644">what? lived</u>
<u n="265" who="S0607" trans="overlap">cos</u>
<u n="266" who="S0644" trans="overlap">where they went on holiday?</u>
<u n="267" who="S0607">cos by the way I was thinking if I just bought a place somewhere</u>
<u n="268" who="S0644" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="269" who="S0607">in England I could go there loads and I just quickly before I'd even thought it through I was like it's too much I can't keep going over there so and I've got to build a life where you are</u>
<u n="270" who="S0644">uhu</u>
<u n="271" who="S0607">but basically what happened to my mum and dad was erm <pause dur="short"/> they erm <pause dur="short"/>  I wonder how far this is no I think it's okay erm <pause dur="short"/> so they were living up north and they went on holiday to France</u>
<u n="272" who="S0644">uhu</u>
<u n="273" who="S0607">and because they were up north when they used to go on the ferry they had to stop so they one night before the ferry</u>
<u n="274" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="275" who="S0607">whereas nowadays it's just straight on the ferry from where we live but</u>
<u n="276" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="277" who="S0607">so they stopped in <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> like probably one on the way there and one on the way back</u>
<u n="278" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="279" who="S0607">and they loved it so much</u>
<u n="280" who="S0644">in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="281" who="S0607">in <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> and then</u>
<u n="282" who="S0644">where's <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/>?</u>

<u n="290" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="291" who="S0607">and erm</u>
<u n="292" who="S0644">they loved it</u>
<u n="293" who="S0607" trans="overlap">so they decided</u>
<u n="294" who="S0644">what? based on one or two</u>
<u n="295" who="S0607" trans="overlap">to move there</u>
<u n="296" who="S0644">trips?</u>
<u n="297" who="S0607">yeah they were like we just love it here</u>
<u n="298" who="S0644">yeah</u>

<u n="300" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="301" who="S0607">so literally and this was a massive undertaking it wasn't just like oh we're hippies let's just move it was like dad was</u>
<u n="302" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="303" who="S0607">erm a lawyer a new lawyer and he had to find a job in <anon type="place"/> so what they did in the end was he found a job in <anon type="place"/> and they found a place where they could afford so they they lived in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="304" who="S0644">in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="305" who="S0607">do you know what? my mum always says this she's said it several times so she'll go where's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> from? and then I'll say I think she's from <anon type="place"/> but I can't remember and this is the other place beginning with C which I know now is <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="306" who="S0644">yes</u>
<u n="307" who="S0607">and then my mum always says do you know we really wanted to live in <anon type="place"/> area but it was too expensive</u>
<u n="308" who="S0644">really?</u>
<u n="309" who="S0607">so we had to go down the other side of <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="310" who="S0644"><anon type="place"/> is that <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="311" who="S0607" trans="overlap">so imagine if they could have afforded it I could have grown up near you</u>
<u n="312" who="S0644" trans="overlap">oh imagine</u>
<u n="313" who="S0607">but we only were there when I was born until I was two so hang on so we went to so we lived in <anon type="place"/> dad commuted to <anon type="place"/> everything was wonderful</u>
<u n="314" who="S0644">where is <anon type="place"/>? <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="315" who="S0607">yeah it's kind of like <pause dur="short"/> nearer to <anon type="place"/> than <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="316" who="S0644">nearer to <anon type="place"/> than <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="317" who="S0607">and erm so</u>
<u n="318" who="S0644" trans="overlap">so you were born though where?</u>

<u n="322" who="S0644" trans="overlap"><unclear>a fraudster</unclear></u>
<u n="323" who="S0607">but then what happened was when I was two they made a boob they moved back up north</u>
<u n="324" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="325" who="S0607">so my mum said I'm too far away from my mum I want to go back</u>
<u n="326" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="327" who="S0607">and I think something else happened like they were visiting and they started to get these thoughts that they should go back so they went back up north</u>
<u n="328" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="329" who="S0607">and they both say big mistake knew straightaway</u>
<u n="330" who="S0644">knew straightaway?</u>
<u n="331" who="S0607">moved back up to <anon type="place"/> were miserable as S H I T and erm <pause dur="short"/> and then so when I between the ages of two and six I lived in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="332" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="333" who="S0607">so actually did start off with a northern accent</u>

<u n="344" who="S0644">I didn't know that <unclear/></u>
<u n="345" who="S0607">and they and then they were like we should never have come back here cos our our hearts down there</u>
<u n="346" who="S0644" trans="overlap">why didn't they like it out of interest?</u>
<u n="347" who="S0607">I think</u>
<u n="348" who="S0644" trans="overlap">what was wrong?</u>
<u n="349" who="S0607">really they <trunc>we</trunc> I think they just they just loved it down south and</u>
<u n="350" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="351" who="S0607">they <trunc>ju</trunc> I mean I'd have to <trunc>a</trunc> I'd have to I I can't I can't really say</u>
<u n="352" who="S0644">what was wrong</u>
<u n="353" who="S0607" trans="overlap">erm</u>
<u n="354" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="355" who="S0607">cos I don't wanna say <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's much better down south</u>
<u n="356" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="357" who="S0607">cos it there are lots of wonderful things about</u>
<u n="358" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="359" who="S0607">up north but I do think that possibly a part of it is that up north is a bit more downtrodden and down south</u>
<u n="360" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="361" who="S0607">is a bit more wow we are actually like on holiday</u>
<u n="362" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="363" who="S0607">I don't' know how to explain it properly I mean for example my auntie and uncle they live in a wonderful part of Yorkshire and it's really beautiful</u>
<u n="364" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="365" who="S0607">but it is a little bit bleak it can be quite bleak even though I've in in even though I think it's great so but it's <trunc>qui</trunc> sort of can't <trunc>rea</trunc> I guess you can't really compare oh I dunno I was gonna say</u>
<u n="366" who="S0644" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="367" who="S0607">something terrible then</u>
<u n="368" who="S0644">no no no</u>
<u n="369" who="S0607">I was gonna say compare <anon type="place"/> with <anon type="place"/> or</u>
<u n="370" who="S0644" trans="overlap">or <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="371" who="S0607" trans="overlap">no that's a totally wrong comparison but yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> so erm and then they so then they went back again</u>
<u n="372" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="373" who="S0607">and that's when they moved to <anon type="place"/> no <anon type="place"/> which is near <anon type="place"/> and then we stayed ever since so erm so anyway there's that was</u>
<u n="374" who="S0644" trans="overlap">have you always lived in that house in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="375" who="S0607">er yeah first we were in <anon type="place"/> and then we moved to <anon type="place"/> and we've always been in that one since I was eleven but the <trunc>mor</trunc>moral of the story is they moved to where they wanted to be on holiday</u>
<u n="376" who="S0644">yes</u>
<u n="377" who="S0607">and it was difficult like my dad had to then find another job down south and it was really difficult and he had to move down first and we didn't</u>
<u n="378" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="379" who="S0607">come down till later and then he had to find a house and</u>
<u n="380" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="381" who="S0607">it was extremely difficult to find a house</u>
<u n="382" who="S0644">uhu</u>
<u n="383" who="S0607">er because they were selling a house up north and buying a house down south so the difference</u>
<u n="384" who="S0644" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="385" who="S0607">in price was massive so</u>
<u n="386" who="S0644" trans="overlap">and also that is hard enough now with the internet</u>
<u n="387" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="388" who="S0644">like imagine doing it then when you had to go and like</u>
<u n="389" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="390" who="S0644">and make appointments and that's how you saw a house</u>

<u n="392" who="S0644">wow</u>
<u n="393" who="S0607">but the other thing is we had to have like a skanky house because it was all that could be afforded</u>
<u n="394" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="395" who="S0607">based on the other house sort of thing and my mum <trunc>al</trunc> still goes on about that shithole house</u>

<u n="400" who="S0644" trans="overlap">no you should</u>
<u n="401" who="S0607">that you know they followed their dream and</u>
<u n="402" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="403" who="S0607">it made me think when I was thinking about living where I wanna live instead of</u>

<u n="405" who="S0607">just trying to get there when I'm off work</u>
<u n="406" who="S0644">but do you know where you wanna live now? it's like</u>

<u n="411" who="S0607">I know that I say everywhere we go that I wanna live there but</u>
<u n="412" who="S0644">I know you don't though not really</u>
<u n="413" who="S0607" trans="overlap">it's just because I I <trunc>s</trunc> I feel like I've got this travelling instinct but</u>
<u n="414" who="S0644">yeah what you mean is you'd like to have the option in to visit anywhere you like</u>
<u n="415" who="S0607">but do you know what else I think it is as well?</u>
<u n="416" who="S0644" trans="overlap">where are we going <unclear/>? <unclear/> there</u>
<u n="417" who="S0607">still not there are we? is it there? erm the other thing is that I don't think it's as simple as <trunc>Fran</trunc> as Germany England</u>
<u n="418" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="419" who="S0607">I think it's also the sea</u>
<u n="420" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="421" who="S0607">like sometimes you can't totally work out what the elements are but for example</u>
<u n="422" who="S0644">yeah</u>

<u n="424" who="S0644">yeah</u>
