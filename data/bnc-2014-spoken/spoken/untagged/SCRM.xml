<u n="1316" who="S0603" whoConfidence="low">no</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0604" trans="overlap">but we can put it on another character or an unfunded event <pause dur="short"/> erm it's just you put it on on a random card one is looking at look at as many infection cards as the current infection rate don't change the order okay <pause dur="short"/> or the person who plays this card and they discard up to three city cards removing one cube matching the colour of each card from anywhere on the board</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0603">so you basically get to remove three three cubes?</u>
<u n="1319" who="S0493">but you'll only remove</u>

<u n="1322" who="S0603">yeah</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0493">you're only gonna bother to use that to to take yellows off</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0603">if if yellows <unclear/></u>
<u n="1325" who="S0493" trans="overlap">but you've got it yellows are a problem if yellow's a problem you wanna keep the yellows to eradicate maybe</u>

<u n="1333" who="S0493" trans="overlap">normal ones like <pause dur="short"/> permanent military base</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0603" whoConfidence="low">where?</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0493" trans="overlap">again if this is the objective we've got every time we've got <unclear>Ollie</unclear> just always do that and we don't really need a military base then <pause dur="short"/> character upgrades if you're in a military base you can quarantine an adjacent city with a quarantine action</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0605">that's quite a good one</u>
