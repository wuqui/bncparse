<u n="134" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah I don't know what it is I think maybe like from my perspective cos I've drawn it and I've like done I remember like the process of it that I can't really appreciate it as <pause dur="short"/> as just a drawing like other people can so I can never</u>
<u n="135" who="S0530" trans="overlap">you see all the flaws in it don't you?</u>

<u n="153" who="S0530">no</u>
<u n="154" who="S0529">you just like the only reason I stopped doing the drawing is because I feel like fed up with it and I'm like right I can't do anything more than this I'm just gonna ruin it even further like <vocal desc="laugh"/> I haven't actually drawn anything that I've been like properly proud of</u>
<u n="155" who="S0530">really?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0530">that's really sad cos</u>

<u n="159" who="S0530" trans="overlap">you're so good</u>
<u n="160" who="S0529"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I dunno</u>
<u n="161" who="S0530" trans="overlap">I always wondered if people that are really good at art or really good at real drawings like you see like cartoons as like really shit or do you just see it as different?</u>
<u n="162" who="S0529">different yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0530">just different</u>
<u n="164" who="S0529" trans="overlap">it's just a different style <pause dur="short"/> like I wish I could draw in that style as well because it's more creative to me</u>
<u n="165" who="S0530">really?</u>
<u n="166" who="S0529">the only way</u>
<u n="167" who="S0530" trans="overlap">really?</u>
<u n="168" who="S0529" trans="overlap">I can sort of draw is by observation and</u>
<u n="169" who="S0530">but I think</u>
<u n="170" who="S0529">and</u>
<u n="171" who="S0530" trans="overlap">observation's harder cos you can't make up shit if it's not there</u>
<u n="172" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="173" who="S0530">you know?</u>
<u n="174" who="S0529" trans="overlap">I know well it's difficult cos your brain tries to make make it up like especially</u>
<u n="175" who="S0530">but you have to kind of and</u>
<u n="176" who="S0529" trans="overlap">when you're drawing people</u>
<u n="177" who="S0530" trans="overlap">ignore it</u>
<u n="178" who="S0529" trans="overlap">you have to ignore it like no that's not where the eye goes like I know it looks like it should go there but in the picture it's actually here and it's like really is frustrating <vocal desc="laugh"/> to get it right and I don't often get it right like I'm most most of the time when I'm doing faces now I use a light box because</u>
<u n="179" who="S0530">oh okay</u>
<u n="180" who="S0529" trans="overlap">it's so much easier to get the face right like cos it's not cheating because so many artists do it and it's just</u>
<u n="181" who="S0530">yeah</u>
<u n="182" who="S0529" trans="overlap">a basic</u>
<u n="183" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0529">like guide of where you want things to go like it you kind of make it your own when you just do the shading so it's it doesn't really count</u>
<u n="185" who="S0530">that's cool</u>
<u n="186" who="S0529">that's cheating in my opinion <vocal desc="laugh"/> some people might say well</u>
<u n="187" who="S0530">if you think about it</u>
<u n="188" who="S0529" trans="overlap">it's just a way of doing creative art</u>
<u n="189" who="S0530" trans="overlap">in some ways yeah</u>
<u n="190" who="S0529" trans="overlap">so <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's easier</u>
<u n="191" who="S0530">I mean art is less creative than you think it is</u>
<u n="192" who="S0529">oh yeah</u>
<u n="193" who="S0530" trans="overlap">it's very er</u>
<u n="194" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="195" who="S0530">like when you actually do art like everyone sees art as creative but when you actually sit and <trunc>dr</trunc> it's like really it's really difficult you know? like not that</u>
<u n="196" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="197" who="S0530" trans="overlap">being creative is not isn't isn't difficult but like it's really</u>
<u n="198" who="S0529">yeah like I don't feel like any of my art's creative I just feel like I'm looking at something and drawing it the way I would the way my hand</u>
<u n="199" who="S0530" trans="overlap">but your hands</u>
<u n="200" who="S0529">works I suppose <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="201" who="S0530" trans="overlap">no it's not the way your hand works it's the way</u>
<u n="202" who="S0529"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="203" who="S0530">the way your kind of your brain projects it and then</u>
<u n="204" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="205" who="S0530" trans="overlap">your hand follows</u>
<u n="206" who="S0529">I dunno</u>
<u n="207" who="S0530" trans="overlap">it's not it's it is a skill</u>
<u n="208" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="209" who="S0530" trans="overlap">it's definitely a skill</u>
<u n="210" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0530">like anyone that can do <trunc>grea</trunc> like great art I bow to because</u>

<u n="215" who="S0530">amazing?</u>
<u n="216" who="S0529" trans="overlap">well my friend especially well my old friend like we kind of fell out a bit but she she draws like insanely realistic faces I'll show you <pause dur="short"/> erm she doesn't really do them anymore but she used to <pause dur="short"/> and me and her were always kind of like competing in in our art class <vocal desc="laugh"/> to make better stuff</u>
<u n="217" who="S0530">oh my god</u>
<u n="218" who="S0529">oh I need to find my phone I don't have Instagram on my Ipod oh shit <unclear/></u>
