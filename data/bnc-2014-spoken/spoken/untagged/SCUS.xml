<u n="367" who="S0618">in a plastic bottle but anyway we'll see so I'm excited by that because when I've been sort of er you know I don't know if necessarily I'll be living in the van I probably won't but <vocal desc="cough"/> when I've been erm I had a tour around Ireland for about a month and lived in the van this is going back a year or two now might even've been a couple of years I suppose and the biggest problem I had was well one showering so needing to find somewhere to shower every fourth day usually <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="368" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="369" who="S0618">erm and getting clean drinking water</u>

<u n="377" who="S0618">erm so now I can fill that up and just filter off from that what I need</u>
<u n="378" who="S0619" trans="overlap">what you need</u>

<u n="382" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="383" who="S0618">so it heats the water so you fill the bag with water leave it outside the van in the sun and you can shower off of that</u>
<u n="384" who="S0619">oh that's <unclear>good uhu</unclear></u>

<u n="775" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="776" who="S0619">and there's not a lot going on and it depends on upbringing and where they're from some <pause dur="short"/> these kids in <anon type="place"/> for example they are twelve or thirteen and there's this boy <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he'll be maybe thirteen this year he's Italian but he lives in France I think he lives in Paris and he can speak erm well he can speak Italian and French he can speak Dutch I think and English is his fourth language</u>
