<u n="15" who="S0518" trans="overlap">so yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0517">I thought it was <trunc>se</trunc> er said seven on the website</u>
<u n="17" who="S0518">oh</u>
<u n="18" who="S0517">cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s been asked to erm <pause dur="short"/> go to it you know as a sixth-former</u>
<u n="19" who="S0518">right</u>
<u n="20" who="S0517">so <pause dur="short"/> but <trunc>s</trunc> but either way I did think oh I bet you're going and I bet we're not running on Wednesday</u>
