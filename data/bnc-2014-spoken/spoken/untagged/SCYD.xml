<u n="3" who="S0588" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="4" who="S0589" trans="overlap">the only thing in the house</u>
<u n="5" who="S0588">we've not even got any oil</u>
<u n="6" who="S0589">yeah that is an issue</u>
<u n="7" who="S0588" trans="overlap">there's butter though</u>
<u n="8" who="S0589">well</u>
<u n="9" who="S0588">we can use that</u>
<u n="10" who="S0589" trans="overlap">I would not use butter but</u>
<u n="11" who="S0588">erm that beanbag I want to knit it</u>
<u n="12" who="S0589">yeah that was good I came across that</u>
<u n="13" who="S0588" trans="overlap">can I? <pause dur="short"/> I was trying to find</u>
<u n="14" who="S0589" trans="overlap">doing a job</u>
<u n="15" who="S0588">the inner bin bag not bin bag the inner beanbag though</u>
<u n="16" who="S0589">well you just don't you just sew that as well?</u>
<u n="17" who="S0588">yeah but I need a pattern for that</u>
<u n="18" who="S0589">I can do a pattern for that dear</u>
<u n="19" who="S0588" trans="overlap">could you? well we could improvise somehow or we buy a really cheap one <pause dur="short"/> a cheap but horrible one but that's the right shape</u>
<u n="20" who="S0589">Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> will be able to sort us out</u>
<u n="21" who="S0588">who's Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>?</u>
<u n="22" who="S0589">the erm come down</u>
<u n="23" who="S0588">I don't know who Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> is</u>
<u n="24" who="S0589">he's our local upholsterer</u>
<u n="25" who="S0588">oh yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0589">in fact he has bags of those darling where's my play?</u>
<u n="27" who="S0588" trans="overlap">does he?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0589" trans="overlap">where have you put my play shoes?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0588">in the cupboard</u>
<u n="30" who="S0589">he has bags of those polystyrene bits</u>
<u n="31" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0589">I'd like to have one</u>
<u n="33" who="S0588" trans="overlap">well we want fireproof</u>
<u n="34" who="S0589">then I would read my book in front right in front of the fire</u>
<u n="35" who="S0588">no but it's a really nice pattern</u>
<u n="36" who="S0589" trans="overlap">unless unless <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> were already there</u>
<u n="37" who="S0588" trans="overlap">the actual pattern's free and I have located the wool but</u>
<u n="38" who="S0589">it's eighty percent polyester</u>
<u n="39" who="S0588" trans="overlap">and here's the downside what's polyester the wool?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0589">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0588">oh that doesn't matter</u>
<u n="42" who="S0589">eighty twenty</u>
<u n="43" who="S0588">erm <pause dur="short"/> the downside is it's gonna cost about ninety pounds</u>
<u n="44" who="S0589">mm well we can buy one for thirty-nine</u>
<u n="45" who="S0588">exactly but it's not as fun <vocal desc="laugh"/> this is the whole thing of making your own things <pause dur="long"/> oh we can't light the fire we've got no logs <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="46" who="S0589" trans="overlap">they haven't emailed me cos it's been a week a week tomorrow and they normally say they'll do it within five to seven days</u>
<u n="47" who="S0588"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> hasn't been fed</u>
<u n="48" who="S0589">do you want to do him whilst I start supper dear?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0588">okay <pause dur="short"/> erm no but I feel really inspired and I want to do it</u>
<u n="50" who="S0589">oh sweet</u>
<u n="51" who="S0588" trans="overlap">so despite the fact that it's going to cost ninety pounds shall we do it anyway?</u>
<u n="52" who="S0589" trans="overlap">that's just the wool?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0588">yes <vocal desc="laugh"/> I mean it's ridiculous but that's what it's like when you make your own clothes <pause dur="short"/> and go to Primark and and buy it for five quid or something <pause dur="long"/> but actually the advantage is I would have the pattern so I'd be in control of it from now till the rest of your lives</u>
<u n="54" who="S0589"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="55" who="S0588">cos I could knit another one if I wanted to</u>
<u n="56" who="S0589">thing is their shelf life probably isn't particularly long</u>
<u n="57" who="S0588" trans="overlap">I think that's true <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I'm wondering that about my hand knitted cushions as well</u>
<u n="58" who="S0589">well at least they're not on the actual floor</u>
<u n="59" who="S0588">no cos the point that you can knit it again <pause dur="short"/> so it's not like when it's over it's not over kind of thing so it's the antithesis of consumer culture isn't it?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0589" trans="overlap">is there any yoghurt left in there that?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0588" trans="overlap">am I right? it's</u>
<u n="62" who="S0589" trans="overlap">is there yoghurt in there?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it's the antithesis of consumer culture if you make your own</u>
<u n="64" who="S0589">I've got to use this if that's alright</u>
<u n="65" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yes you agree?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0589">yes darling</u>
<u n="67" who="S0588">yes</u>
<u n="68" who="S0589">feed <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="69" who="S0588">because you can do it again</u>
<u n="70" who="S0589">well <pause dur="short"/> yes okay</u>
<u n="71" who="S0588">well what were you going to say?</u>
<u n="72" who="S0589">I think just buy one</u>
<u n="73" who="S0588">oh not when I'm getting inspired</u>
<u n="74" who="S0589">well could you knit a tiny one just like a small footstool?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0588">no I want the one it's a nice size</u>
<u n="76" who="S0589">just scale it down fifty percent</u>
