<u n="30" who="S0012">I've asked all about it <pause dur="short"/> and the only way to do it is have laser treatment <pause dur="short"/> and I don't want laser treatment <pause dur="short"/> I'd rather wear glasses just in case anything go wrong with the laser treatment</u>
<u n="31" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0012">I think oh well I'd a done it if I was younger but if you're younger you got longer to live with no sight</u>

<u n="68" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0024">most of them say it's the best thing they've ever done</u>

<u n="72" who="S0024">mm</u>

<u n="75" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0012">but that might be</u>
<u n="77" who="S0024">I think I should do it</u>

<u n="84" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0012">and that's the cheapest is three hundred and sixty-five quid</u>
<u n="86" who="S0024">yeah and you're unlikely to have the cheapest eyes type</u>

<u n="123" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0144">because the trouble is with the software we've got I don't think we can use an MP4 to listen to it</u>
<u n="125" who="S0012">no that's right <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="126" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> So</u>

<u n="128" who="S0012">well I thought well MP3 is supposed to be <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="129" who="S0024">I don't know anything about iPods</u>
<u n="130" who="S0012">mP3 is supposed to be sound <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> sound</u>

<u n="137" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0012">and that's what that tried to do when we no tried to change it back to MP4</u>
<u n="139" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it's complicated it now <pause dur="short"/> cos all of the previous software was just compatible with MP3</u>
<u n="140" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0144">and they can't play MP4</u>
<u n="142" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="143" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> So</u>
<u n="144" who="S0013">oh</u>

<u n="149" who="S0012">MPEG</u>
<u n="150" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0012">and <trunc>har</trunc> there's hardly any players that play it back</u>
<u n="152" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0012">well there will be <pause dur="short"/> just like everything else <pause dur="short"/> but it seems stupid to me</u>
<u n="154" who="S0024">like always</u>
<u n="155" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0024">well if there's no video why would you need the MP4?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0012">well that's right</u>
<u n="158" who="S0024"><unclear/></u>
<u n="159" who="S0012">but that's an MP4 track you see <pause dur="short"/> which which is compatible with video <pause dur="short"/> so I suppose you could put it on a video</u>
<u n="160" who="S0024">oh</u>
<u n="161" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0012">your <trunc>MP</trunc> you know you could record a video and then stick that on</u>

<u n="164" who="S0012">you can put anything on video <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> you can you can put Wave Player on a video</u>
<u n="165" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0024">they just try and confuse you so you just keep up-to-date all the time <pause dur="short"/> so you just go oh I'll just have the <trunc>m</trunc> the new one <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="167" who="S0013">yep</u>

<u n="170" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="171" who="S0024">I've always wanted a Mac computer once but never gone for the iPod</u>
<u n="172" who="S0144">I I think</u>

<u n="273" who="S0024">new cable</u>
<u n="274" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="275" who="S0012">and when the wind blow <pause dur="short"/> if the wind's blowing in the in a certain direction you would've still thought the er the the waves would come through to the aerial</u>
