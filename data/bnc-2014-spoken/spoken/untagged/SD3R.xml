<u n="101" who="S0349" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0336">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> they think oh my secret's out there <pause dur="short"/> erm yeah I had dinner last night with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s birthday</u>
<u n="103" who="S0344">oh right</u>
<u n="104" who="S0336">so we went to <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> which was quite nice and it was nice to like</u>
<u n="105" who="S0344" trans="overlap">how is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0336">he seems pretty sound he didn't seem very happy about erm some of the things the girls were saying at my house party</u>
<u n="107" who="S0349" whoConfidence="low">what</u>
<u n="108" who="S0344" trans="overlap">what?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0336">he made it was really awkward cos I kind of knew what he was referencing erm but you know when we were all kind of talking about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0349" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0350" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="112" who="S0336">he was kind of sat right there and he made a comment last night about like oh your girls when they get together they can be really bitchy and I was like oh you know er <trunc>yo</trunc> you I mean I said that's just them like that it's take what you get like they don't really mean</u>
<u n="113" who="S0349" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">what was what was he saying?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0336">I think he was actually making more reference to like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="115" who="S0349" whoConfidence="low">oh</u>
<u n="116" who="S0336" trans="overlap">you know how <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> gets especially about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like the pair of them can be like <pause dur="short"/> fairly mean</u>
<u n="117" who="S0344">they're not very erm tactile about it they're just like I don't care</u>
<u n="118" who="S0336">yeah and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was sat like right there but like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was pretty sound about it in the end like it's not like he he didn't he didn't like make it obvious that it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> they were talking about and he didn't really like drop me in it to sort of say like</u>
<u n="119" who="S0344">well you were there</u>
<u n="120" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0344" trans="overlap">and didn't say anything</u>
<u n="122" who="S0336">yeah he just</u>
<u n="123" who="S0344" trans="overlap">but like the thing is about <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is I don't really think he realises the full extent of like how <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> has been to make people <trunc>w</trunc> think that way about it</u>
<u n="124" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0344" trans="overlap">because like if you went into the ins and outs of it like the reason people are so easily erm the reason people might go oh be be maybe slightly more harsh and more bitchy than they would in any other situation is because they don't really feel like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> would behave any differently if it was them in their their shoes because obviously she's snaked a lot of people</u>
<u n="126" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0344">so with that in mind it makes it very difficult for people to do it now it doesn't necessarily you've got to pick your time and your place when you speak about stuff which is maybe</u>
<u n="128" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0344">which is <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s main problem but erm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0336">I did feel really awkward cos like after you guys all left like I could tell <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was a bit off and at first I thought it was <trunc>som</trunc></u>
<u n="131" who="S0349" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">really?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0336">yeah I thought it was something that I'd done or said or whatever but he was actually sound with me last night so I think he might have just been like getting a bit defensive but like he's a weird I mean I know him and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> go way back but he's really protective of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> to the point where like he's really blind to a lot of the stuff she does and like I just think if</u>
<u n="133" who="S0344">mm</u>
<u n="134" who="S0336">like I <trunc>rea</trunc> er like one of</u>
<u n="135" who="S0344" trans="overlap">not being funny does he not remember when she slept with every single one of his friends</u>
<u n="136" who="S0336">I know</u>
<u n="137" who="S0344" trans="overlap">and basically like</u>
<u n="138" who="S0336">and then said l</u>
<u n="139" who="S0344" trans="overlap">screwed with his emotions</u>
<u n="140" who="S0336">exactly</u>
<u n="141" who="S0344" trans="overlap">absolutely and completely and</u>
<u n="142" who="S0336" trans="overlap">and the thing is</u>
<u n="143" who="S0344" trans="overlap">fucked him over</u>
<u n="144" who="S0336">I feel really funny now about spending time like as like three couples that we do because before <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> couldn't give a shit about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like didn't wanna spend any time with her like <trunc>w</trunc> to the point where I like I remember birthdays when we were out in <anon type="place"/> like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s birthday where like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> would be annoyed that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was there like even though like obviously <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was his girlfriend and then as soon as she'd got with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> it she wanted to be best mates with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I'm like you know I just can't stand that two-faced like</u>
<u n="145" who="S0344">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0336">I'm not saying she has to go to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and be like oh by the way like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> nearly left you for me lols that's why don't wanna spend with you</u>
<u n="147" who="S0344">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="148" who="S0350" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/> lol</u>
<u n="149" who="S0336">like but it's just the awkwardness now cos I kind of see her and I'm like I feel like you're being quite fake</u>
<u n="150" who="S0349" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0336">like and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> might be completely over the situation and might genuinely want to like get to know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="152" who="S0349" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0336">but you know when you just feel a bit awkward cos you just know there's so much more to the situation</u>
<u n="154" who="S0349" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0344">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0336">but yeah I dunno I did feel quite bad</u>

<u n="160" who="S0349" whoConfidence="low">have you seen much more of her?</u>
<u n="161" who="S0336">no I haven't seen anything of her like that's that's what makes it difficult cos I like</u>

<u n="163" who="S0336">I know I should feel bad but like</u>
<u n="164" who="S0344">I saw her we went to the cinema</u>

<u n="167" who="S0336">mm</u>
<u n="168" who="S0344" trans="overlap">like and I'm just not like that I'm not I don't find anything awkward like when someone comes in even if that other person's awkward with them</u>
<u n="169" who="S0336">yeah</u>
