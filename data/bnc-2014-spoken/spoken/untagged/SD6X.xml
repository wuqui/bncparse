<u n="1000" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Just fill a bucket with something <pause dur="short"/> um no but it was really nice food <pause dur="short"/> er it <trunc>w</trunc> it was you know they could tell they'd done it really well <pause dur="short"/> and put a lot of thought into it <pause dur="short"/> and it was really nice tasting and stuff <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so I had like belly pork <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> which was very nice <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so yeah it was um very good <pause dur="short"/> and it wasn't overpriced <pause dur="short"/> while there wasn't a lot of food it was very nice <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="1003" who="S0179">thirty or forty?</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0058">thirty or forty on top of that</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0179">and that was a wine with each course?</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0058">um <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> and they they pair them with the courses <pause dur="short"/> that's the whole point of it <pause dur="short"/> so er cos you might not want one wine to go with your starter and your main course</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0058">so the proper people do it like that <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> But I watched er no that's <trunc>w</trunc> er I was watching Masterchef at lunch-time and it's <vocal desc="laugh"/> really bad <pause dur="short"/> it's like you know the episode of The Likely Lads where they're trying to find out not not to try and find out the score?</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0058">Cos Masterchef's finished and the finalist's been <trunc>announ</trunc> er sorry the winner's been announced <pause dur="short"/> but I don't wanna find out until I've er had a chance to watch all the episodes next week <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> So I need to avoid the BBC website <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Um but they basically they were cooking in Michelin-starred restaurants <pause dur="short"/> and um and then one of them sort of like Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in London <pause dur="short"/> so I thought I'd go on and have a look</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0058">and it's like properly pricey <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Like er they had different levels <pause dur="short"/> so they had like fixed price menu which was however much for three courses <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>c</trunc> expensive</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0179"><unclear/>?</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0058">pff <pause dur="short"/> I'm trying to remember the prices now actually <pause dur="short"/> it was something like er forty-five pounds for three courses</u>
<u n="1015" who="S0179">that's not too bad</u>
<u n="1016" who="S0058">which wasn't too for what it was it was <trunc>f</trunc> quite reasonable <pause dur="short"/> and sort of thirty pounds for two <pause dur="short"/> which er you know <pause dur="short"/> very expensive but not horrendous</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0179">no you can</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0058">for the <trunc>ki</trunc> it was really good looking stuff <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> and then the that was the fixed price <pause dur="short"/> then they had the  la carte</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="1020" who="S0058">and then they had like premier <pause dur="short"/> and then they had seasonal specials <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Well these were like yeah sort of ninety pounds a head for the food <pause dur="short"/> looked amazing <pause dur="short"/> like six yeah seven courses <pause dur="short"/> probably you could get to <unclear/> around with it <pause dur="short"/> it just looks incredible</u>
<u n="1021" who="S0179">surely that that's not that expensive</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0058">Gordon Ramsay?</u>
