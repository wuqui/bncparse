<u n="302" who="S0426" trans="overlap">given that you're <trunc>y</trunc> well</u>
<u n="303" who="S0427" trans="overlap">well because to do so in any other class of ticket is illegal</u>
<u n="304" who="S0426">well that makes it doubly so doesn't it?</u>
<u n="305" who="S0427">I think it</u>
<u n="306" who="S0426" trans="overlap">it makes it</u>
<u n="307" who="S0427" trans="overlap">I think it I think it's written on the tickets that I get from Wimbledon you cannot</u>

<u n="312" who="S0426">it's very hard to know how you could ever police such a system</u>
<u n="313" who="S0427">well I'd say it I mean unless it's going to come to the the to the <trunc>t</trunc> I mean I think some rock concerts have done this unless you have to turn up with a ticket and your passport</u>
<u n="314" who="S0426">well</u>
<u n="315" who="S0427">you know</u>
<u n="316" who="S0426" trans="overlap">in countries er we've had this discussion before like Italy and Spain where</u>
<u n="317" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="318" who="S0426" trans="overlap">you must carry your DNI all the time your <pause dur="short"/> you know identity card</u>
<u n="319" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="320" who="S0426">then it's plausible it's it's a feasible security system</u>
<u n="321" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="322" who="S0426" trans="overlap">to require people to bring their</u>
<u n="323" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="324" who="S0426" trans="overlap">identity <trunc>car</trunc> well cos they have to have it anyway</u>
<u n="325" who="S0427" trans="overlap">and <trunc>m</trunc> for all I know that may happen in er</u>
<u n="326" who="S0426" trans="overlap">well but not in Britain because you're not</u>
<u n="327" who="S0427" trans="overlap">no</u>

<u n="330" who="S0426">and the last thing you wanna do is take it to a rock concert for god's sake</u>
<u n="331" who="S0427">well exactly</u>
<u n="332" who="S0426" trans="overlap">it's a ridiculous thing to do</u>
<u n="333" who="S0427">and <pause dur="short"/> er and in any event there are there are so many ways around it because <trunc>y</trunc>you hear I don't know I I happened to read a review of Paul McCartney recently</u>
<u n="334" who="S0426">mm</u>
<u n="335" who="S0427" trans="overlap">and and they were saying he's still doing it at the age of</u>

<u n="338" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0427">but I know for a fact as soon as that came online people would have snapped up the tickets</u>
<u n="340" who="S0426">yes</u>
<u n="341" who="S0427">and then the following day when you thought all the tickets were gone there's a ticket agency that's suddenly selling them</u>
<u n="342" who="S0426">sure</u>
<u n="343" who="S0427">but not at a hundred pounds a shot</u>
<u n="344" who="S0426" trans="overlap">no no okay</u>
<u n="345" who="S0427" trans="overlap">you know</u>
<u n="346" who="S0426">right yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0427" trans="overlap">so you know that that might have been legitimate</u>
<u n="348" who="S0426">sure</u>
<u n="349" who="S0427" trans="overlap">but tickets are being sold above their</u>
<u n="350" who="S0426" trans="overlap">sure</u>
<u n="351" who="S0427">face value</u>
<u n="352" who="S0426">sure</u>
<u n="353" who="S0427" trans="overlap">and some people say oh well that's just the market that's supply and demand get used to it</u>
<u n="354" who="S0426">well</u>
<u n="355" who="S0427" trans="overlap">and others say and including some <trunc>o</trunc>one or two actually <trunc>st</trunc></u>
<u n="356" who="S0426" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="357" who="S0427">rock stars saying</u>
<u n="358" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="359" who="S0427">no no I</u>
<u n="360" who="S0426" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="361" who="S0427">want them sold to fans at this price I don't want them</u>
<u n="362" who="S0426" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="363" who="S0427" trans="overlap">going anywhere else</u>
<u n="364" who="S0426" trans="overlap">sure if they can get that</u>
<u n="365" who="S0427">you know</u>
<u n="366" who="S0426">er you know agreed er by the <pause dur="short"/> by the er administrators that's fair enough but the kind of thing the the agency had a mind there is is legit because it's I think it's called ticket stop or something like that</u>
<u n="367" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="368" who="S0426">and I got into Arsenal that way because what they do is somebody sells back their <trunc>ti</trunc></u>
<u n="369" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="370" who="S0426" trans="overlap">er it actually it was Spurs sells back their ticket to</u>
<u n="371" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="372" who="S0426" trans="overlap">the agency at a price where they get three quarters of their money back</u>
<u n="373" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="374" who="S0426">and the agency sells it at either face value or face value plus five percent</u>
<u n="375" who="S0427" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="376" who="S0426">so you get the chance to get a ticket <pause dur="short"/> nobody loses too much who's bought</u>
<u n="377" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah I understand</u>
<u n="378" who="S0426" trans="overlap">whatever and they get a bit of an administration fee and so on</u>
<u n="379" who="S0427" trans="overlap">I <trunc>th</trunc> I think that may be an exception well well <trunc>m</trunc>maybe it is an exception to the rule but</u>
<u n="380" who="S0426">they do it for all kinds of things <unclear>though</unclear></u>
<u n="381" who="S0427" trans="overlap">what I was thinking of was slightly murkier</u>
<u n="382" who="S0426">yes it is murkier</u>
<u n="383" who="S0427" trans="overlap">in the sense</u>
<u n="384" who="S0426" trans="overlap">sure</u>
<u n="385" who="S0427" trans="overlap">that they were getting hold of so many tickets</u>
<u n="386" who="S0426">okay no that's</u>
<u n="387" who="S0427" trans="overlap">you know</u>
<u n="388" who="S0426" trans="overlap">a different kettle of fish okay right</u>
<u n="389" who="S0427">that you wonder how it how it's being done you know and and the other big bone of contention of course is that er even even when things are legitimately being <trunc>s</trunc>sold through Ticketmaster <pause dur="short"/> you have to pay a booking fee</u>
<u n="390" who="S0426">yes sure</u>
<u n="391" who="S0427" trans="overlap">and then you have to pay a percentage because you haven't got the right card</u>
<u n="392" who="S0426">right right</u>
<u n="393" who="S0427" trans="overlap">and then there's postage</u>
<u n="394" who="S0426" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="395" who="S0427">on top of it</u>
<u n="396" who="S0426">sure</u>
