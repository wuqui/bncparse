<u n="96" who="S0439">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>as I say</unclear> at the moment we're going through a restructure <pause dur="short"/> and they said that basically they can move us positions if there <unclear>is a similar</unclear> our job doesn't change</u>
<u n="97" who="S0450">yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0439">the thing is we've already over the last four months been merging with production so my job has now changed fifty percent anyway</u>
<u n="99" who="S0450">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0439">so I've gained another fifty percent extra work</u>
<u n="101" who="S0450">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0439">so</u>
<u n="103" who="S0450">it's not the best but it isn't bad</u>
<u n="104" who="S0439">so now they're like having another restructure it's fine like I'm not worried about it I don't think they're not gonna make us redundant</u>
<u n="105" who="S0450">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0439">but you'd really want them to like <pause dur="short"/> re-evaluate our contracts and I don't think they're going go</u>
<u n="107" who="S0450">yes but I most places don't they're like</u>
<u n="108" who="S0439" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="109" who="S0450">they're like oh you know they're in the they're not gonna leave <pause dur="short"/> unless they make a big fuss</u>
<u n="110" who="S0439">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="111" who="S0450">and some you know some people were making a fuss and like I'm not getting what I need but</u>
<u n="112" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0450">most people <pause dur="short"/> and I don't think it worked and they didn't they won't do it <unclear>forward</unclear> either</u>
<u n="114" who="S0439">no</u>
<u n="115" who="S0450">so like our company say ah you know we'll <pause dur="short"/> review pay and benefits <pause dur="short"/> to go in it and <pause dur="short"/> be competitive with like the market</u>
<u n="116" who="S0439">but they're not</u>
<u n="117" who="S0450">but ours is probably like everyone knows we get paid less than people around here you know for a Midlands business <pause dur="short"/> like you everyone knows that but no one like</u>
<u n="118" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0450">they don't change it you'll get more you'll just get inflation every year and like</u>
<u n="120" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing that I really don't like about London though is that you just <pause dur="short"/> unless you're earning over like thirty-five <unclear>sort of</unclear> thousand pounds you can't have a you can't enjoy the same lifestyle as what you can in other parts of the country</u>
<u n="121" who="S0450" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> that's <pause dur="short"/> it's true though isn't it? cos I have lot of <unclear>difference</unclear> where like cos I'm <trunc>i</trunc> just living at home like if I was in <pause dur="short"/> you wouldn't have it you'd</u>
<u n="122" who="S0439">no yeah</u>
<u n="123" who="S0450" trans="overlap"><unclear>you'd just live you'd spend</unclear></u>
<u n="124" who="S0439">but you obviously save a hell of a lot more than most people because you can live at home</u>
<u n="125" who="S0450" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">your water</u>

<u n="130" who="UNKMALE" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">jug for you thank you</u>
<u n="131" who="S0450">but it's just yeah that's what I think I would make if I had to <pause dur="short"/> go back to London or anywhere else</u>
<u n="132" who="S0439" trans="overlap">you'd suddenly realise how expensive it is yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0450" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos I'd obviously like <pause dur="short"/> basically I was <pause dur="short"/> you know it's a reality check that <pause dur="short"/> like I will <pause dur="short"/> I it'll didn't like go into like you know you just have to be so tight in what you do and have to limit yourself as to what you do</u>
<u n="134" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's not just like rent it's like</u>
<u n="135" who="S0450" trans="overlap"><unclear>cos then</unclear></u>
<u n="136" who="S0439">then you've got council tax and you've got bills and you've got travel and you know and it's just <pause dur="short"/> everything adds up</u>
<u n="137" who="S0450" trans="overlap">travel <pause dur="short"/> food <pause dur="short"/> nights out <pause dur="short"/> meals out <pause dur="short"/> cos you always go for more meals</u>
