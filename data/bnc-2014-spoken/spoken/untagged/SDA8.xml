<u n="497" who="S0383" trans="overlap">importance placed on it</u>
<u n="498" who="S0330">I agree it think there's too much emphasis on like so what are you interested in? and it's like well <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>e</trunc> to be honest at sixteen I was interested in like taking loads of drugs and getting fucked up and listening to like really weird music and putting myself in really uncomfortable situations do I wanna make a career out of that? no of course I fucking don't <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know what mean?</u>
<u n="499" who="S0383" trans="overlap">yeah I think it's really irresponsible</u>
<u n="500" who="S0330" trans="overlap">and and but but like but like all of those aspects would potentially be good in in a in a billion different other careers alongside like some other <unclear/> or whatever or or er <trunc>e</trunc> <trunc>e</trunc> no like it's <pause dur="short"/> er cos a very very complex thing and I think you're right that that that people are like oh so you're interested in clothes you should be in fashion whereas actually that person who's interested in clothes might actually just be really good with people and be quite sort of visual and be like and and could therefore apply that that those skills and so like a fucking billion different jobs man it's like</u>

<u n="502" who="S0330" trans="overlap">it's so stupid</u>
<u n="503" who="S0383" trans="overlap">or to an industry that we actually have and people can make as much money as they</u>
<u n="504" who="S0330" trans="overlap">yeah yeah exactly</u>

<u n="507" who="S0383" trans="overlap">you know like we don't have a fucking <unclear/></u>
<u n="508" who="S0326" trans="overlap">but I always think they <trunc>shou</trunc> I know it's <unclear/> but they should teach things in school like learning to drive and like stuff you can use</u>
<u n="509" who="S0330">yeah</u>
<u n="510" who="S0326" trans="overlap">so it shouldn't just be like <pause dur="short"/> what are you gonna be?</u>
<u n="511" who="S0330">yeah yeah there's this whole and like</u>
<u n="512" who="S0383" trans="overlap">but I don't I <unclear/></u>
<u n="513" who="S0326" trans="overlap">and teach you how to be a functioning person</u>
<u n="514" who="S0330">yeah yeah yeah exactly it's like</u>
<u n="515" who="S0383" trans="overlap">but the issue I think is is like</u>
<u n="516" who="S0330" trans="overlap">there's this all there's all this emphasis on on on on on on on this this like sole career being your identity and that's what you are whereas actually especially as a woman I I I know I know it's different for men as well but but but historically as a woman you are a mother like maybe or not but you're also like a huge part of your identity <trunc>i</trunc> like you know you're a mother a sister a er a a <pause dur="short"/> like a daughter and all these other aspects or like a you know I am part of this and I'm part of that and I do this and I do that but I also do this for work and like these like super plural understandings of identity and I think like education is very very very much about like I'm gonna be a doctor <pause dur="short"/> or I'm gonna be a teacher <pause dur="short"/> and that's not that's not like that's not real life that's not</u>
<u n="517" who="S0326">yeah</u>

<u n="519" who="S0383" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="520" who="S0330">bullshit like no one like very few people do just one thing or they do one thing for a bit and then they do another thing for a bit <pause dur="short"/> and so how does that idea of you you being able to do more than one thing is a really like that's not how it's taught at all</u>
<u n="521" who="S0383">no</u>
<u n="522" who="S0330">is it?</u>
<u n="523" who="S0383">no it was I felt really like disgusted by the whole process</u>
<u n="524" who="S0330">I bet yeah it's <unclear/></u>
<u n="525" who="S0383" trans="overlap">and it was but also it was like what was really like <pause dur="short"/> the it was like so this like rude boy turned up and he was like he wanted to look out on the sportswear course and he was like he actually had like he was really like <unclear>talented with</unclear> what he was doing but then it was like he was going through the <trunc>sys</trunc> like he was like here's my contextual research and here's my like rubbings of like fucking trees a bit on the side <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't matter like you don't have to like go through that</u>
<u n="526" who="S0330">mm</u>
<u n="527" who="S0383">to be like that's not gonna like validate this thing you have here and <unclear/></u>
<u n="528" who="S0326" trans="overlap">also but some people are aware of like the whole thing and know that they're just they do this and put this act on</u>

<u n="577" who="S0383" trans="overlap">the life that we lived in so it was like you know it was like if you were like kind of interested in film everyone was like go and be a director or if you're like you're kind of interested in clothes people were like go and be a fashion designer like there was</u>
<u n="578" who="S0328" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
