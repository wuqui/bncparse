<u n="146" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0655">either that or <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s making it up</u>

<u n="149" who="S0655">in our solar system a ninth planet or tenth planet including Pluto which I think</u>
<u n="150" who="S0653">that seems a bit mean doesn't it to?</u>
<u n="151" who="S0655">yeah just take taking a planet</u>
<u n="152" who="S0653">I don't know how they decided</u>
<u n="153" who="S0655">out of the solar system</u>
<u n="154" who="S0653">you know that it was too small and it couldn't be a planet but anyway <pause dur="short"/> yes so that chart was wrong and all the books that they'd written about planets were wrong so</u>
<u n="155" who="S0654">do you know what erm a pin-sized thingy of a blue planet of a blue planet erm was the same</u>
<u n="156" who="S0653" trans="overlap">a pin-sized thingy</u>
<u n="157" who="S0655">had yeah I've told you this the Empire State thing</u>

<u n="161" who="S0655">oh</u>
<u n="162" who="S0654">what is it?</u>
<u n="163" who="S0655">you know the matter of stars</u>
<u n="164" who="S0654">matter of erm matter of a star weighs erm the same as three Empire States</u>
<u n="165" who="S0653">three Empire State buildings <pause dur="short"/> so pretty heavy</u>
<u n="166" who="S0655">yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0655">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but not actually of a star <pause dur="short"/> of red or blue</u>
<u n="168" who="S0654">yeah a huge planet</u>
<u n="169" who="S0655" trans="overlap">which is a star but it's <trunc>n</trunc></u>
<u n="170" who="S0653" trans="overlap">it's what?</u>
<u n="171" who="S0655">it's much bigger than the sun and much more powerful it's blue which means it's extremely hot</u>
<u n="172" who="S0653">so that's probably what will happen to our sun one day then?</u>
<u n="173" who="S0655">what? it will turn blue?</u>
<u n="174" who="S0653">sorry if a what?</u>
<u n="175" who="S0655">turn blue</u>
<u n="176" who="S0653">well I guess so if it's burning up</u>
<u n="177" who="S0655">the red ones are the coldest</u>

<u n="179" who="S0654">mum shall I tell you something you might not know?</u>
<u n="180" who="S0655">when it destroys the moon how hot will it get?</u>
<u n="181" who="S0654" trans="overlap">the blue ones are the hottest and the red ones are the coldest <pause dur="short"/> planets</u>
<u n="182" who="S0653">mm planets or stars?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0654">planets or stars <pause dur="short"/> the size medium sorry</u>
<u n="184" who="S0653">are you talking about planets or stars in terms of blue and red?</u>
<u n="185" who="S0654">erm planets or stars depending</u>
<u n="186" who="S0653">well a star is sort of burning it's slowly it's dying that's what a star is</u>
<u n="187" who="S0654">once they die they create a black hole</u>
<u n="188" who="S0653">and sometimes the stars that you can see in the sky are already dead but they were sort of still you know? the speed of light and all I can't remember exactly now but it means you can be looking at it <pause dur="short"/> here <pause dur="short"/> but you know a million miles away where it lives it's actually died out already <pause dur="short"/> which I think is pretty amazing</u>
<u n="189" who="S0655">mm <pause dur="long"/> although <pause dur="short"/> there is I can't <trunc>bel</trunc> although</u>

<u n="194" who="S0653">I don't think it does</u>
<u n="195" who="S0655">but it definitely doesn't have planet nine</u>
<u n="196" who="S0653">I know because it's a new discovery my love</u>
