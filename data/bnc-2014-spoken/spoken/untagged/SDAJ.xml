<u n="8" who="S0041" trans="overlap">seventeen <pause dur="short"/> you know it's like my favouritist belt <pause dur="short"/> it's really not very fashionable now but it just fitted perfectly on that hook <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> on the tighter hook</u>
<u n="9" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> oh nice <pause dur="short"/> mm winner <pause dur="short"/> eat more chips that's clearly the answer</u>
<u n="10" who="S0041">yeah clearly the answer <pause dur="short"/> not to think yes this is going really well <pause dur="short"/> keep it up <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> eat chips and curry that is the answer</u>
<u n="11" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> uh-huh <pause dur="short"/> that is always the answer <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="12" who="S0041">my next step which obviously won't probably be this year but you know it's alright</u>
<u n="13" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0041">is my aim is to wear a bikini <pause dur="short"/> I've never worn one in my life before <pause dur="short"/> like in my whole life <pause dur="short"/> never</u>
<u n="15" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> wow</u>
<u n="16" who="S0041">never <pause dur="short"/> never never never</u>
<u n="17" who="S0084">but you wear a trikini</u>
<u n="18" who="S0041">well yeah there isn't much to that</u>
<u n="19" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0041">but that is the most naked thing I've ever owned</u>
<u n="21" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="22" who="S0041">swimwear wise</u>
<u n="23" who="S0084">yeah I mean absolutely hate it but I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I don't know why I don't own a swimming costume <pause dur="short"/> I suppose cos I don't go swimming</u>
<u n="24" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0084">if I'm  if I'm  in beach wear it's because I'm on the beach and in which case I want to get a brown tummy</u>
<u n="26" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0084">but only because I want to lie somewhere <pause dur="short"/> I don't want to go walking around so I always sarongs etcetera</u>
<u n="28" who="S0041" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> parading <pause dur="short"/> yes so that's my aim before I die and I figure over the next couple of years he's probably going to be the closest I'm going to get to that</u>
<u n="29" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> nice <pause dur="short"/> army training <pause dur="short"/> army boot camp</u>
<u n="30" who="S0041">army boot camp <pause dur="short"/> do you think after the army boot camp takes like twelve weeks or whatever it is you get a holiday or do you just have to go straight into it?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> I think they give you a holiday to like kiss your family goodbye <pause dur="short"/> I mean you will come back presumably <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="32" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> cos maybe that would be perfect time for eighteen thirties crazy holiday</u>
<u n="33" who="S0084">ooh <pause dur="short"/> naked holiday</u>
<u n="34" who="S0041">naked holiday basically yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos I really want to do this as well <pause dur="short"/> I mean I think I'm too old already so what's going to happen is</u>
<u n="35" who="S0084">you're going to do an eighteen to thirties holiday?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0041">yes</u>
<u n="37" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="38" who="S0041">and it all sounds very good in my head and hilarious fun with loads of teenage boys <pause dur="short"/> however I think in actual practice after five days I'm going to want rip my own eyes out</u>
<u n="39" who="S0084">you're going to want to kill everybody <pause dur="short"/> you know the staff <pause dur="short"/> all the younger kids because it's they're all going to be tiny and young</u>
<u n="40" who="S0041" trans="overlap">all the screaming girls <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> they will actually just be eighteen <pause dur="short"/> that's the problem</u>
<u n="41" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0041">but erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> that I work with which you wouldn't think of this if you met him <pause dur="short"/> he used to rep</u>
<u n="43" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0041">in Greece and he said well you can still do those types of holidays at those resorts but not with eighteen thirties</u>
<u n="45" who="S0084" trans="overlap">eighteen year olds <pause dur="short"/> oh okay</u>
<u n="46" who="S0041">so there are places that are set up for that holiday but they don't specify themselves under the eighteen thirties bracket so they don't</u>
<u n="47" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0041">they get young people but most young people will go to the brochure club travel agent place and ask for eighteen thirties <pause dur="short"/> he said but there's quite loads of other companies that do it <pause dur="short"/> they just don't advertise as that <pause dur="short"/> so I could do that</u>
<u n="49" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> there you go <pause dur="short"/> that's an idea <pause dur="short"/> that was always mine and my sisters backup plan was to be holiday reps <pause dur="short"/> I think there was some sort of TV show at the time that all looked very glamorous and everyone was having a lovely time</u>
<u n="50" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">but I think in reality you would probably kill everybody</u>
<u n="52" who="S0041">yes and you'd be knackered</u>
<u n="53" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="54" who="S0041" trans="overlap">absolutely whacked all the time</u>
<u n="55" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="163" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="164" who="S0084">but they all knew not not to go there with me erm but I'd I'd join in and I'd give it as good as I got but they would never they'd never cross the line seeming as they called me Miss Manners they knew that there was certain things like say bad as that wouldn't get that bad</u>
<u n="165" who="S0041" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0084">erm my problem my my worry is that maybe when I'm there I might get carried away in joining in and taking the piss out of them and then I'll get in trouble</u>
<u n="167" who="S0041" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="168" who="S0084">for being too familiar with them which is a bit of a</u>

<u n="171" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="172" who="S0084">but I suppose when you're there and there's other people that are officers to learn from that have already done that position for ages you'll know what type of behaviour to adopt won't you</u>
<u n="173" who="S0041" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah and you've been a manager before so it's not totally alien</u>
<u n="174" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> the only thing is when you're a manager you go home and then you're silly all the time</u>
<u n="175" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="176" who="S0084">whereas I won't be able to go home and be silly <pause dur="short"/> I'll just be silly there and then people might see</u>

<u n="178" who="S0084">yeah that's alright <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I could <trunc>c</trunc></u>
<u n="179" who="S0041" trans="overlap">because you'd have to have some sort of outlet wouldn't you</u>
<u n="180" who="S0084">yeah I couldn't keep me silly contained for all that time</u>
<u n="181" who="S0041">you'd just be like guy <pause dur="short"/> you know that American guy that's gone around shooting people in erm Afghanistan</u>
