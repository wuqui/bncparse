<u n="1" who="S0486">okay hi good morning <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> thank you</u>
<u n="2" who="S0534" trans="overlap">hi</u>
<u n="3" who="S0486">thank you for talking to me today</u>
<u n="4" who="S0534" trans="overlap">that's alright oh alright</u>
<u n="5" who="S0486" trans="overlap">erm and you did mention a subject that you might tell me about?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0534" trans="overlap">yes I'm gonna tell you about the eighth of January nineteen fifty-nine in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="7" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="8" who="S0534">now you <trunc>m</trunc>may you may not remember it cos you may not be old enough but right after the war finished they introduced National Service</u>
<u n="9" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0534">this was for young men so many people had come out of the armed forces that they were getting short after a while</u>
<u n="11" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0534">and once you got to eighteen you were conscripted into either one of the forces or if you were very unlucky into the coalmines</u>
<u n="13" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="14" who="S0534">to do two years' service there <pause dur="short"/> well I wasn't eighteen until oh nineteen fifty-seven? but at that time National Service was slowing down and they didn't want very many people so in fact they were calling us up when we got older and older and I wasn't called up until I was nineteen and a half <pause dur="short"/> and the letter arrived in the post saying report to the depot of the <anon type="place"/> light infantry in <anon type="place"/> street <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="16" who="S0534" trans="overlap">sent me a railway warrant so I got on the train at home caught the train to <anon type="place"/> and by this time you could see various other young men looking bewildered hanging around the railway station and when I was watching them I think perhaps one of the highlights of the day was that a castle class locomotive had just been renamed Sir Edward Elgar</u>
<u n="17" who="S0486">oh right</u>
<u n="18" who="S0534">and I hadn't seen it with its new name plates on</u>
<u n="19" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0534">until that day so I can say I saw that on the eighth of January nineteen fifty-nine</u>
<u n="21" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0534">anyhow us guys began to recognise one another that we were all in the same boat so we started to make our way through <anon type="place"/> er to get to <anon type="place"/> someone had told us where it was and er as we approached it there was a sergeant coming down the road obviously looking for young bewildered men</u>
<u n="23" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="24" who="S0534" trans="overlap">and er in the in the British army er the senior NCOs wear a red <trunc>s</trunc>sash mainly over their right shoulder but his guy had his sash over his left <trunc>so</trunc> shoulder and that dates back to a battle many years ago when a lot of the officers of the <anon type="place"/> light infantry were killed in action because they always wore their sash on the left shoulder</u>
<u n="25" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh I see</u>
<u n="26" who="S0534">and because the NCOs took over on that day it was decreed that those guys should then wear their sash on the same side as the officers</u>
<u n="27" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="28" who="S0534">again just going off tangent very slightly</u>
<u n="29" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0534">erm there was a big coloured picture of a senior NCO from every infantry regiment in the British army</u>
<u n="31" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0534">taken outside of Buckingham Palace they'd gone to meet the king</u>
<u n="33" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="34" who="S0534">and the picture wasn't very clear but all these chaps lined up had their sash over the right shoulder but there was one there and you couldn't see his face over his left shoulder so</u>
<u n="35" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0534">you know he was a <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0486">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0534" trans="overlap">anyhow we walked up through <anon type="place"/> Street</u>
<u n="39" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0534">and there was the barracks</u>
<u n="41" who="S0486" trans="overlap">keep going yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0534">erm formidable go in <pause dur="short"/> get your name separate you there was an intake of eighty young men that day and it was to be the last National Service intake for the <anon type="place"/> light infantry and we were divided into two sections platoons there was <anon type="place"/> platoon and <anon type="place"/> platoon and those two names come from former generals that did their early days</u>
<u n="43" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="44" who="S0534" trans="overlap">in the regiment and we were directed to barrack rooms big Victorian red brick barrack rooms cold they were heated by one open fire at each end and you were given a small amount of coke which was meant to last you for the week but in reality you could burn it in a day</u>
<u n="45" who="S0486">right <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="46" who="S0534">and we went in we were given some bedding and not proper uniform to start with but denims which was enough to carry on with <pause dur="short"/> and er so that was the first day we were talked to by this very frightening sergeant that I saw in the street not only did he have a red sash he had a very red face and frightening face and to further <pause dur="short"/> diminish his appearance in the eyes of <unclear>anybody he knew</unclear> the poor chap</u>
<u n="47" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0534">had a cross eye</u>
<u n="49" who="S0486">oh dear <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="50" who="S0534">so <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="51" who="S0486">not good for firing then</u>
<u n="52" who="S0534">he he <trunc>l</trunc> well he er</u>
<u n="53" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="54" who="S0534">he was alright actually</u>
<u n="55" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="56" who="S0534" trans="overlap">perhaps he closed his bad eye</u>
<u n="57" who="S0486">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="58" who="S0534">but er <vocal desc="cough"/> but anyhow the next day we were taken for getting the uniform issued to us and er the quartermaster was a chap called major <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who was very proud to say smoking his pipe so he was quite casual I was here like you thirty-six years ago and he'd gone all the way up through and he had a wonderful eye and he could say look at people and say size that size that</u>
<u n="59" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="60" who="S0534">and all the way through and this thing was issued</u>
<u n="61" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="62" who="S0534">and then it came to greatcoats and you were told to put on a greatcoat and er he said when I look at you don't look down because if you look forward your coat will droop in the front</u>
<u n="63" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="64" who="S0534">so of course he got to me and the first thing I did was look down</u>
<u n="65" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0534">so he said to me don't look down there's bugger all there <vocal desc="laugh"/> and that was his</u>
<u n="67" who="S0486" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0534">that was his expression but erm again towards that end of the first week the army being very crafty they decide you should have all your injections on a Friday because some of them were very painful</u>
<u n="69" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0534">and they wanted to give you the Saturday and Sunday in your own time to get over them</u>
<u n="71" who="S0486">gosh</u>
<u n="72" who="S0534">so one of them was er what they called a TAB injection</u>
<u n="73" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0534">you probably know this</u>
<u n="75" who="S0486">erm well</u>
<u n="76" who="S0534">it's a mixture of er typhus</u>
<u n="77" who="S0486" trans="overlap">everything</u>
<u n="78" who="S0534" trans="overlap">or <trunc>t</trunc> everything together</u>
<u n="79" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0534">and it's extremely painful</u>
<u n="81" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0534" trans="overlap">and I remember a big red mark coming up on my arm and it was a very sharp boundary to this red mark and ordinary</u>
<u n="83" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0534">flesh if you touched the red oh</u>
<u n="85" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0534" trans="overlap">but you'd go <trunc>s</trunc> at half an inch the other way and it was normal</u>
<u n="87" who="S0486">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0534">anyhow we were all taken off to what was <anon type="place"/> camp in those days</u>
<u n="89" who="S0486">oh right</u>
<u n="90" who="S0534">and er because that's where the medical officer was</u>
<u n="91" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="92" who="S0534">and given all these injections in fact the medical officer was a retired colonel from the Royal Army Medical Corps</u>
<u n="93" who="S0486">oh right</u>
<u n="94" who="S0534" trans="overlap">cos I don't think they had enough</u>
