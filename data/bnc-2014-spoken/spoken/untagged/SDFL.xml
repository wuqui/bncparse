<u n="2355" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="short"/> yep</u>
<u n="2356" who="S0152">and the reason they're becoming academies is because the government don't want the control don't want the local authorities to have that control <pause dur="short"/> so for Norfolk for instance they would have probably gone into <unclear/> <vocal desc="cough"/> Norfolk Education would probably have gone into Special Measures</u>
<u n="2357" who="S0024">mm</u>
