<u n="546" who="S0618" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> and I think it was I don't know if it was a gender thing didn't even get an interview but I was incredibly strong at the time</u>
<u n="547" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="548" who="S0618">could've done it easy</u>
<u n="549" who="S0619">er but <pause dur="short"/> er <vocal desc="sigh"/> but er we were talking about this and you know they were saying that's why lots of people go to England for this sort of money</u>
<u n="550" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="551" who="S0619">but at the same time it was like <unclear/> it's so wrong though if you're sort of trying to encourage people to stay at home and look after their <trunc>chil</trunc> well not encourage but if you're giving them the opportunity</u>
<u n="552" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="553" who="S0619">to stay at home and look after the kids it means there's gonna be no women in industries <pause dur="short"/> and er</u>
<u n="554" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="555" who="S0619">all of like er the majority of the <trunc>injuri</trunc> industries already driven by <pause dur="short"/> by men are gonna be even more</u>

<u n="558" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="559" who="S0619">in the workplace <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="560" who="S0618" trans="overlap">that is a lot of money if that's equivalent to a wage that's pretty crazy isn't it?</u>
<u n="561" who="S0619">well that's what they said and that's why er in England and Germany it's not so much of a problem because there's a huge disparity between this sort of these benefits and wages</u>
<u n="562" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="563" who="S0619">whereas here it's so similar that you can just swap one for the other</u>
<u n="564" who="S0618">yeah <pause dur="short"/> wow</u>
<u n="565" who="S0619">yeah so they said it's so stupid they should be putting money into free kindergartens or free childcare for <unclear>young</unclear> people</u>
<u n="566" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah childcare or whatever <pause dur="short"/> after school clubs</u>

<u n="575" who="S0619" trans="overlap">traditional and conservative yeah</u>
<u n="576" who="S0618">yeah and church-driven <pause dur="short"/> so I suppose from that viewpoint you know to my mind <pause dur="short"/> erm I feel that Christian dogma and Catholic dogma in particular <pause dur="short"/> is at some level deliberately patriarchal</u>
<u n="577" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="578" who="S0618">and at some level</u>
<u n="579" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
