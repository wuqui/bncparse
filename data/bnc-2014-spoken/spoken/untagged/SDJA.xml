<u n="34" who="S0330">that's weird</u>
<u n="35" who="S0383">so yeah he'd like sleep for like three days and not three months but then like stay awake for like a week-and-a-half and the I can't remember like but they did like all the crazy shit like rewired peoples brains and stuff</u>
<u n="36" who="S0328">I met someone who'd been and he was well crazy</u>

<u n="1125" who="S0383">yeah but also the I was speaking to someone about this today</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0330" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0383">it's like the way shit does happen is way more like common sense like I remember when I was doing shit in Morocco when we like wanted something there you'd just like go up to someone and ask them</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0330" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0383">or like in India it's like hey I want a palm tree so like I <unclear/> I called up this guy and I was like hey we need a palm tree for this photoshoot and he turned up with a rickshaw drove me round it was like point at which tree you want and I'll dig it up</u>

<u n="1132" who="S0330" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a weird like it's a weird sort of er like double like parallel thing where in one civilisation that's like really like it in some ways in the UK it's really easy to do like all sorts of stuff and in some ways it's really really difficult and</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0328" trans="overlap">makes it more over-complicated</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0330">yeah whereas whereas</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0383" trans="overlap">but we've turned it into the industry and you have to pull all those things in position</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0330" trans="overlap">of course if someone can make money</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0383">so people have a job</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0330">at any point and and also pay tax than like at any level</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0328" trans="overlap">and like regulations <unclear/> and shit</u>

<u n="1142" who="S0330">you <unclear/></u>
<u n="1143" who="S0383" trans="overlap">but it also it's just ridiculous because it's like people just cos they have the ability to ask for stuff just ask for things and that's what's really strange about my job is like you can't just be like do you actually want that? and like have you actually sat there? I was like <unclear/> been like this is what I wanted to create it's like let's get like a chess set and a badger and like let's shoot like maybe up a hill and oh I'm just like just take five more minutes and like make a decision rather than just exercising a right to like make someone fucking work for you</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0330" trans="overlap">but why do they do that? just cos they're really rich and <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0383" trans="overlap">cos they fucking can and they're getting paid in</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0330">yeah</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0383">another thing I really worked out which I always like walking around here being like how the fuck are these people drinking lattes all day? like what the fuck do they do? how are they buying like <unclear/> t-shirts for like two hundred pound and like doing this? and like oh shit people actually get paid like people get paid ridiculous amounts of money</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0330">yeah</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0383">like</u>

<u n="1154" who="S0330" trans="overlap">no of course but there are lots of people like who who who can look as if they're really money but actually <vocal desc="laugh"/> really aren't</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0383">yeah true</u>
<u n="1156" who="S0330">you know what I mean? and I think <anon type="place"/> is massively like the <unclear/> huge spectrum and it's very difficult to tell the difference between somebody who's really really poor and someone who's actually making loads of money which is kind of weird</u>
<u n="1157" who="S0383">yeah no it is</u>
<u n="1158" who="S0330">you know it's kind of it like there's a weird like they're <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> because it's kind of because it's because you were in a situation where it's cool to have like your boots are scuffed or whatever you know there aren't those normal</u>
<u n="1159" who="S0383">there aren't like at risk signifiers</u>

<u n="1162" who="S0330">and and and the people who drink lattes are also drinking lattes with the people who are unemployed like they're work like they're in the same caf√©s you know and that's kind of weird</u>
<u n="1163" who="S0328" trans="overlap">they should have they should have separate caf√©s for poor people cos</u>
