<u n="111" who="S0464" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0456">so they come and then within the first couple of months they <pause dur="short"/> they get disabused and suddenly find out no it's actually hard graft</u>
<u n="113" who="S0464">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="114" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="115" who="S0464">it a lot's changed but erm <pause dur="short"/> not in <trunc>rea</trunc> well student health really kind of</u>
<u n="116" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0464">gone more nurse-led now so <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> it's always a bit like that but</u>
<u n="118" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="119" who="S0464">it's run by the nurses now not the doctors <pause dur="short"/> they do have doctors there but</u>
<u n="120" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0464">it's mostly run by us now</u>
<u n="122" who="S0456">okay</u>
<u n="123" who="S0464">so</u>
<u n="124" who="S0456" trans="overlap">so it's it stays in the profession <unclear>mm</unclear></u>
<u n="125" who="S0464" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="126" who="S0456" trans="overlap">you probably like doctors even less now because you see so little of them</u>
<u n="127" who="S0464">yeah <trunc>u</trunc> well we see them like but <pause dur="short"/> you know we're</u>
<u n="128" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0464">probably cheaper than doctors aren't we I suppose?</u>
<u n="130" who="S0456">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0464">you know we do a lot <pause dur="short"/> we do as <trunc>mu</trunc> well we don't do as much but</u>
<u n="132" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0464">we can do like prescribing and stuff like that so <pause dur="short"/> we are cheaper than doctors I suppose <pause dur="short"/> cheap labour</u>
<u n="134" who="S0456" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah well it's <trunc>u</trunc> I <trunc>s</trunc> I'm sure a lot of the er <pause dur="short"/> run-of-the-mill stuff <pause dur="short"/> and it's far more often now that <pause dur="short"/> if you go and see the GP</u>
<u n="135" who="S0464">mm</u>
<u n="136" who="S0456">and you want an appointment you get an appointment with a nurse <pause dur="short"/> unless</u>
<u n="137" who="S0464" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's it <pause dur="short"/> I mean and and also what we've got is is in the last five years that's a new thing is the walk-in</u>
<u n="138" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="139" who="S0464">so basically</u>
<u n="140" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0464">you can come in sit and wait <pause dur="short"/> and get an appointment</u>
<u n="142" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0464">so whereas like</u>
<u n="144" who="S0456" trans="overlap"><unclear>just like mm mm</unclear></u>
<u n="145" who="S0464"><trunc>i</trunc> five years ago</u>
<u n="146" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0464">you'd have appointments for the doctors like you could just book</u>
<u n="148" who="S0456" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0464">but now you come in and you you just sit and wait</u>
<u n="150" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0464">so that's the there's an impact really <pause dur="short"/> I don't know whether sometimes that creates a little bit of a monster really with</u>
<u n="152" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0464">they're getting more</u>
<u n="154" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0464">dependent on you</u>
<u n="156" who="S0456">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0464">cos you notice the students coming in <pause dur="short"/> and some of them are in every other day</u>
<u n="158" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0464">so you create like <pause dur="short"/> a dependency which is not really good either</u>
<u n="160" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="161" who="S0464">they can just come in whenever they want</u>
<u n="162" who="S0456" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="163" who="S0464">you know?</u>
<u n="164" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> sounds a bit <unclear>doesn't it?</unclear></u>
<u n="165" who="S0464">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I mean <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> and in <anon type="place"/> you know doctor <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s in <anon type="place"/> are you in there?</u>
<u n="166" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> no I'm <pause dur="short"/> erm <unclear><anon type="place"/></unclear></u>
<u n="167" who="S0464">oh are you?</u>
<u n="168" who="S0456">which is which is really <pause dur="short"/> I mean it has changed completely because they <pause dur="short"/> the guy <pause dur="short"/> who ran it he actually owned the practice but he's retired now so now it's it's</u>
<u n="169" who="S0464" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="170" who="S0456">I don't know <vocal desc="sigh"/> because I don't <pause dur="short"/> a I'm not here and</u>
<u n="171" who="S0464">yeah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0456">B I'm not <unclear>ill</unclear> enough so I don't really go there very often</u>
<u n="173" who="S0464" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="174" who="S0456">erm <pause dur="short"/> so every time <trunc>l</trunc> in the last <pause dur="short"/> few times that I've been I always would see somebody else</u>
<u n="175" who="S0464">mm</u>
<u n="176" who="S0456">and it just seems to be a lot of doctors and then of course a lot of interns</u>
<u n="177" who="S0464">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0456">erm <pause dur="short"/> there was ages ago there was this guy from Austria and I</u>
<u n="179" who="S0464">yeah</u>
<u n="180" who="S0456">I thought I don't understand him and I'm not quite sure whether he understands me <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="181" who="S0464"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="182" who="S0456"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="183" who="S0464">but you'd be more be able to understand them than anyone wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="184" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> I should've I should've I should've <unclear>switched it over</unclear></u>
<u n="185" who="S0464">see that's another</u>
<u n="186" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="187" who="S0464">thing as well you don't get the continuity</u>
<u n="188" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0464">so you don't see your <trunc>doc</trunc> the same doctor</u>
<u n="190" who="S0456" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="191" who="S0464">do you know what I mean which is not a good thing either</u>
<u n="192" who="S0456" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> no because before it was <pause dur="short"/> yeah there was doctor <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="193" who="S0464">mm</u>
<u n="194" who="S0456">but he wasn't my doctor but there was a female doctor and she was the one who was my <pause dur="short"/> gP</u>
<u n="195" who="S0464">mm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0456">within the practice</u>
<u n="197" who="S0464">yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0456" trans="overlap">and it was only if <pause dur="short"/> she was off or whatever</u>
<u n="199" who="S0464">yeah</u>
<u n="200" who="S0456">that we would see her <pause dur="short"/> when she left then it became all yeah you would see whoever</u>
<u n="201" who="S0464" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but you see the elderly now have got to have their own doctor <pause dur="short"/> they've got to have their own named doctor</u>
<u n="202" who="S0456" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="203" who="S0464">and anyone with a long-term condition has gotta have their own doctor</u>
<u n="204" who="S0456">that makes sense</u>
<u n="205" who="S0464">so they kind of can request to see them but then again <pause dur="short"/> you be could be waiting a couple of weeks to see them</u>
<u n="206" who="S0456">yeah</u>
<u n="207" who="S0464">do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="208" who="S0456" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so it's it's it's in theory that they've got their own doctor and in practice only if they're lucky</u>
<u n="209" who="S0464" trans="overlap">it doesn't really work <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> but <trunc>l</trunc> I suppose if they see the doctor they can book them in</u>
<u n="210" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="211" who="S0464">say well</u>
<u n="212" who="S0456">mm</u>
<u n="213" who="S0464">I'll see you in two months they can book them in for two months do you know what I mean with them?</u>
<u n="214" who="S0456" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
