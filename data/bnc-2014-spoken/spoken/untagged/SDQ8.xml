<u n="8" who="S0655">huh</u>
<u n="9" who="S0653">er it cost a thousand pounds for the holiday did it?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0655">yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0653">mm well as I said the thing is you won't know whether that was it probably was the flight and the accommodation where you were staying but what people forget about holidays is that you also want to have a bit of spending money cos you're going to be buying food out there and you want to enjoy yourself</u>
<u n="12" who="S0654">we didn't need to buy food</u>
<u n="13" who="S0653">mm?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0654">we didn't need to buy food <unclear/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0655">yes we did we went to the shops and it was boiling and I needed to sit next to the freezer</u>
<u n="16" who="S0654">yeah we actually had to go in the car and wait our car was so cool</u>
<u n="17" who="S0653">who was in the car with you?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0654"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>

<u n="24" who="S0655">dad</u>
<u n="25" who="S0653">really?</u>
<u n="26" who="S0654">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0653">he got to go out get out of shopping?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0655"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0654">he said we were getting too hot and he had to stay with us</u>
<u n="30" who="S0653">in the shop you were getting too hot?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0655">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0653">was it not air-conditioned in the shop?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0654">well erm</u>
<u n="34" who="S0653" trans="overlap">wow</u>
<u n="35" who="S0655">I <trunc>th</trunc> well normally shops aren't air-conditioned it's cos the people in Spain are pretty much used to it there</u>
<u n="36" who="S0653">but as you know the money for the sound recordings that we're doing even the one right now is towards going towards our holiday in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0654">mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0653">and erm I think it's very expensive in <anon type="place"/> normally but I managed to find a <trunc>r</trunc>a really nice house for us for a week and er</u>
<u n="39" who="S0654">we saw that house</u>
<u n="40" who="S0653">sorry?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0654">we saw it</u>
<u n="42" who="S0653">you've seen it haven't you? it's very pretty <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> might be able to come and spend a couple of days with us although</u>
<u n="43" who="S0655" trans="overlap">how much does it cost?</u>
<u n="44" who="S0653">right well I think it cost something like four hundred pounds for the week</u>
<u n="45" who="S0655"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="46" who="S0653">which is very very good I mean but normally I wouldn't be able to afford it at all but what I'm saying is cos you were saying oh well you know we could <trunc>s</trunc> go to Spain or something but the thing is not only have we got to pay I mean I've paid some money already towards the house</u>
<u n="47" who="S0654" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0653">that we're going to live in for a week but I need to pay the rest of it but I need to make sure we've got enough money set aside for for food when we go there</u>
<u n="49" who="S0655">and for souvenirs</u>
<u n="50" who="S0653">and er yeah souvenirs and ice creams and you know one of those meals that we have at least will be hopefully fish and chips so I'm not constantly slaving in the kitchen like I do normally</u>
<u n="51" who="S0655"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="52" who="S0653">so it's important that and also the petrol cos it's a really long way to go to <anon type="place"/> from here I mean probably the petrol alone will be about a hundred pounds I reckon</u>
<u n="53" who="S0655">woah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0654" trans="overlap">also mum?</u>
