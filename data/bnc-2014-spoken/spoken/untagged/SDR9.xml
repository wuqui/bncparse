<u n="109" who="S0083">it's actually really nice <pause dur="short"/> it's <trunc>n</trunc> you know almost new sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> so I thought <pause dur="short"/> and I only paid a pound for that one</u>
<u n="110" who="S0084">hmm</u>

<u n="112" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="113" who="S0083">but if you wanna read it first that's fine</u>
<u n="114" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="115" who="S0083">it was recommended <pause dur="short"/> I haven't read it yet</u>
<u n="116" who="S0084">okay <pause dur="short"/> but well I thought I wouldn't go to the bookshop because I wouldn't be able to take anything with me cos all my books are in boxes</u>
<u n="117" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's true</u>
<u n="118" who="S0084">Cos it <trunc>seem</trunc> it seems a bit unfair to turn up and not take anything</u>

<u n="121" who="S0083">and still go in and take books <pause dur="short"/> but you know</u>

<u n="123" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0084">and the idea being that you don't clog up your house with more books</u>
<u n="125" who="S0083">yeah exactly <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="126" who="S0084">so</u>
<u n="127" who="S0083">and it's a good way of yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0083">anyway</u>
<u n="130" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> no it is a really good idea</u>
<u n="131" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0084">was it run by people that you know?</u>
<u n="133" who="S0083">no <pause dur="short"/> I thought there would be but there weren't <pause dur="short"/> I met <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and a couple of other people but</u>

<u n="137" who="S0083">um <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> didn't <pause dur="short"/> um I'm pretty sure other people did but well I know I mean I know the usual suspects did but</u>
<u n="138" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="139" who="S0083">I don't know whether Jenny did <pause dur="short"/> I thought she might be there this afternoon but um</u>
<u n="140" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0083">but she wasn't so <pause dur="short"/> I should give her a ring actually <pause dur="short"/> I might do that in a minute <pause dur="short"/> he didn't put that back this morning <pause dur="short"/> so I thought I'll come in and hoover and then I stopped to have something to eat <pause dur="short"/> but I think I will put the hoover over quickly</u>
<u n="142" who="S0084">I thought he just left it out because he was coming back later <pause dur="short"/> no point hoofing it</u>
<u n="143" who="S0083">well that's what he does but I would've put it back</u>
<u n="144" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="145" who="S0083">you know but anyway</u>
<u n="146" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0083">no I mean he would've left the whole thing so</u>
<u n="148" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0083">but we do have to sit here in the evening so</u>
<u n="150" who="S0084">how did it go with the woman yesterday? He wasn't very talkative when I tried to ask him</u>
<u n="151" who="S0083">no he wouldn't be <pause dur="short"/> er it was good</u>
<u n="152" who="S0084">oh <pause dur="short"/> third time was the charm then? Oh no this was a different woman</u>
<u n="153" who="S0083">it was a different woman <pause dur="short"/> but I got the feeling I mean nothing was said obviously <pause dur="short"/> she's gotta go and talk to people but</u>
<u n="154" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0083">it's quite difficult talking it over</u>
<u n="156" who="S0084">sure</u>
<u n="157" who="S0083">I mean it's it's quite a difficult thing for all of us to do</u>
<u n="158" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0083">but at the end the things she was saying  she was saying  oh you know I I need to speak to my superiors and I need to do this I need to do that <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="160" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="161" who="S0083">but she didn't er she didn't just say er clearly you don't qualify <pause dur="short"/> um she didn't say we did but</u>
<u n="162" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0083">I dunno I just got the impression that <trunc>sh</trunc> you know it would go through</u>
<u n="164" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="165" who="S0083">so I got everything across <pause dur="short"/> I mean I could be completely <trunc>wro</trunc> and obviously it's not her</u>
<u n="166" who="S0084">it's not her final sign off</u>
<u n="167" who="S0083">say so <pause dur="short"/> but she's very experienced <pause dur="short"/> she seems she knew exactly what she was doing <pause dur="short"/> what she was talking about</u>
<u n="168" who="S0084">Good</u>
<u n="169" who="S0083">so</u>
<u n="170" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="171" who="S0083">er um well we'll just have to wait and see</u>
<u n="172" who="S0084">and was she talkative about this sort of declassifying of his condition? Cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was saying that they've you know a few months ago they'd decided to now classify it as a syndrome</u>
<u n="173" who="S0083">we didn't mention that</u>
<u n="174" who="S0084">as opposed to <pause dur="short"/> oh right</u>
<u n="175" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="176" who="S0084">thought <trunc>bes</trunc> thought it best not to <pause dur="short"/> probably for the best</u>
<u n="177" who="S0083">that is a very kind of unresolved question</u>
<u n="178" who="S0084">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> well er I mean it'll only rear its ugly head if it's gonna affect the funding isn't it <pause dur="short"/> you know if they the they decide that his condition is not as severe</u>
<u n="179" who="S0083">thing is he <trunc>w</trunc> you know he's entitled to support</u>
<u n="180" who="S0084">well clearly</u>
<u n="181" who="S0083">the question is</u>
<u n="182" who="S0084">the fact that he has been for the last five er eight years</u>
<u n="183" who="S0083">well exactly</u>
<u n="184" who="S0084">whatever it is</u>
<u n="185" who="S0083">um she um I mean as far as I can tell talking to Dido er sorry Dodi who's also a social worker</u>
<u n="186" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="187" who="S0083">and I spoke to the Autistic Society as well <pause dur="short"/> spoken to them at length</u>
<u n="188" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0083">um <trunc>h</trunc> <trunc>ho</trunc> this is not unusual apparently <pause dur="short"/> so um</u>
<u n="190" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="191" who="S0083">but the thing is it's just a question of which department? You know cos each department has its own funding <pause dur="short"/> the same as you do</u>
<u n="192" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="193" who="S0083">you know same in social services</u>
<u n="194" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="195" who="S0083">um and er</u>
<u n="196" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="197" who="S0083">if if they er as a department as a learning disability department won't fund things then another department should</u>
<u n="198" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0083">but we'll see <pause dur="short"/> I don't know  I don't know  She didn't go into that</u>
<u n="200" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="201" who="S0083">so I think that's what we have to talk about when she comes back to us</u>
<u n="202" who="S0084">right <pause dur="short"/> so did she give you an end date for that?</u>
<u n="203" who="S0083">no</u>
<u n="204" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="205" who="S0083">no cos obviously she passes things you know she then has to sort of take it to the next level and speak to them about it <pause dur="short"/> she will report to them what she learnt from the assessment and you know</u>
<u n="206" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="207" who="S0083">it's very bureaucratic</u>
<u n="208" who="S0084">yeah of course <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and presumably the funding differs from county to county?</u>
<u n="209" who="S0083">well it does <pause dur="short"/> I mean everything differs from county to county</u>
<u n="210" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's mad isn't it</u>
<u n="211" who="S0083">it is <pause dur="short"/> completely</u>
<u n="212" who="S0084">you'd think it'd be more uniform</u>
<u n="213" who="S0083">you would think so</u>
<u n="214" who="S0084">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> well it's a waiting game then</u>
<u n="215" who="S0083">and the good thing is I mean she did say this actually <pause dur="short"/> because he gets DLA as well as income support</u>
<u n="216" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="217" who="S0083">well it's ESA now but anyway <pause dur="short"/> and he he's always had the disability living allowance</u>
<u n="218" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="219" who="S0083">and that's a national award obviously <pause dur="short"/> that's from the government <pause dur="short"/> that's not</u>
<u n="220" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="221" who="S0083">local</u>
<u n="222" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="223" who="S0083">um when she heard that he got that she said oh that's good <pause dur="short"/> and I think that makes a difference <pause dur="short"/> you know if if he's</u>
<u n="224" who="S0084">if he's seen as needing that</u>
<u n="225" who="S0083">needing that then that will help his</u>
<u n="226" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="227" who="S0083">claim I think</u>
<u n="228" who="S0084">so is he still getting that even though he's living with dad?</u>
<u n="229" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="230" who="S0084">yeah? Right</u>
<u n="231" who="S0083">yeah because it's his entitlement</u>
<u n="232" who="S0084">right <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> is he getting less because he's living with dad? How does it work?</u>
<u n="233" who="S0083">no but what they what they're doing and she talked about this and I think this is new <pause dur="short"/> this is you know following on from you know various budget things <pause dur="short"/> um they sometimes make people contribute money to their package <pause dur="short"/> whatever</u>
<u n="234" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="235" who="S0083">their funding package is</u>
<u n="236" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="237" who="S0083">you know how many hours? How much money? How many this that and the other?</u>
<u n="238" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="239" who="S0083">they ask people to contribute towards it <pause dur="short"/> especially if people are you know sort of comfortable then they expect that</u>
<u n="240" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="241" who="S0083">which I think er fair enough</u>
<u n="242" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="243" who="S0083">but not many disabled people are in that position so</u>
<u n="244" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="245" who="S0083">um <pause dur="short"/> and he's certainly not <pause dur="short"/> and she said sometimes <trunc>i</trunc> you know if if people have no money at all then you know it's gonna be a you know nominal amount</u>
<u n="246" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="247" who="S0083">well that's fine <pause dur="short"/> so maybe they're looking at that</u>
<u n="248" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="249" who="S0083">and if if he had to contribute some of his I mean it's tough but especially while he's living at dad's it wouldn't be as bad <pause dur="short"/> I don't know  I don't know  I mean it could be cos he's you know he he has no other money apart from that and his father's retired and I</u>
<u n="250" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="251" who="S0083">don't have any money</u>
<u n="252" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="253" who="S0083">it could be that you know on that basis that you know he won't have to make a contribution <pause dur="short"/> but the fact that she was talking <trunc>abou</trunc> that's what I mean she was talking about this</u>
<u n="254" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="255" who="S0083">scenario <pause dur="short"/> and I'm thinking if you thought he wasn't gonna get it you wouldn't actually bother going into all this</u>
<u n="256" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> it would be very unfair</u>
<u n="257" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="258" who="S0084">sort of raise your hopes in that way</u>
<u n="259" who="S0083">I mean there's nothing definite</u>
<u n="260" who="S0084">no of course</u>
<u n="261" who="S0083">because they can easily do that but</u>
<u n="262" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="263" who="S0083">it just made me feel that you know she thought it was</u>
<u n="264" who="S0084">well that's encouraging</u>
<u n="265" who="S0083">we'll see  we'll see</u>
<u n="266" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's just a waiting game now isn't it</u>
<u n="267" who="S0083">it is <pause dur="short"/> but that was a huge step doing that so</u>
<u n="268" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's difficult for him I know <pause dur="short"/> but he just he needs huh but it's I mean I don't know  I don't know  what the answer is <pause dur="short"/> but he needs to have a bit of a better attitude <pause dur="short"/> more positive attitude <pause dur="short"/> I know it's so so hard <pause dur="short"/> it'd be hard er if I was looking for jobs <pause dur="short"/> but it's all very well him saying you know I there's nothing that I wanna do and isn't life very difficult for me <pause dur="short"/> and there is an element of needing to take a more</u>
<u n="269" who="S0083">he can't do that though</u>
<u n="270" who="S0084">positive attitude</u>
<u n="271" who="S0083">he doesn't have a positive attitude <pause dur="short"/> for several reasons</u>
<u n="272" who="S0084">I know it's flippant for me to say that</u>
<u n="273" who="S0083">no no no</u>
<u n="274" who="S0084">and I I know it's</u>
<u n="275" who="S0083">no</u>
<u n="276" who="S0084">probably I'm not being able to understand his position <pause dur="short"/> but I do know that that <trunc>i</trunc> that that's what he struggles with but you know with a supportive family behind him and us you know suggesting things <pause dur="short"/> and I know er you know the support</u>
<u n="277" who="S0083">the thing is</u>
<u n="278" who="S0084">necessarily might not be there</u>
<u n="279" who="S0083">he can't  he can't the the  the problem has always been with trying to get him something to do job course whatever is the fact that he can't imagine what it's gonna be like if he hasn't done it</u>
<u n="280" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="281" who="S0083">the things he has done he hasn't liked <pause dur="short"/> hasn't fitted in <pause dur="short"/> hasn't</u>
<u n="282" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="283" who="S0083">worked out</u>
<u n="284" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so they're his only experiences</u>
<u n="285" who="S0083">that's it <pause dur="short"/> and they've all been negative ones</u>
<u n="286" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="287" who="S0083">he's also um you know he's in this state of mind where he will think negatively about anything <pause dur="short"/> he has been extremely depressed <pause dur="short"/> he has no motivation <pause dur="short"/> he has no self-confidence <pause dur="short"/> and it might seem like he does because you know in a family setting he can be quite</u>
<u n="288" who="S0084">Cocky</u>
<u n="289" who="S0083">not er no I wouldn't have said that <pause dur="short"/> but he can be quite bullish</u>
<u n="290" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="291" who="S0083">um <pause dur="short"/> but that comes from something else</u>
<u n="292" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="293" who="S0083">I think</u>
<u n="294" who="S0084">well we're probably the the only ones he is</u>
<u n="295" who="S0083">oh yeah</u>
<u n="296" who="S0084">comfortable around</u>
<u n="297" who="S0083">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> that he can be like that with <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> definitely <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> when he has enjoyed things it's <trunc>be</trunc> <trunc>be</trunc> it's been mostly because of the company rather than you know the people he's been with rather than what he's actually doing</u>
<u n="298" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="299" who="S0083">and that always makes a difference <pause dur="short"/> but he can't er obviously you can't tell before you start something if that's gonna work out <pause dur="short"/> you can't make that happen <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's <trunc>s</trunc> it either does or it doesn't <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="300" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="301" who="S0083">um</u>
<u n="302" who="S0084">and er that's that's his not being able to imagine something you know</u>
<u n="303" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and he finds it very difficult to socialize to talk to people <pause dur="short"/> he can't do small-talk <pause dur="short"/> he knows he can't work in a shop</u>
<u n="304" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="305" who="S0083">or anywhere where er it's the public <pause dur="short"/> he just can't do that <pause dur="short"/> and he hates it <pause dur="short"/> it makes him feel terrible</u>
<u n="306" who="S0084">yeah I know</u>
<u n="307" who="S0083">so er it's absolutely the wrong thing <pause dur="short"/> so the only experiences he has had well apart from I mean he er as I say he enjoyed working in the kitchen but he didn't like cooking <pause dur="short"/> he just liked er the banter</u>
<u n="308" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="309" who="S0083">and I think the same with the <trunc>ga</trunc> gardening perhaps slightly more because it was outdoors</u>
<u n="310" who="S0084">and it was one on one</u>
<u n="311" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="312" who="S0084">rather than you know a big group <pause dur="short"/> which he does find intimidating</u>
<u n="313" who="S0083">no I mean she was talking about things you know um there are colleges and there are courses in things like horticulture and not that he's you know particularly interested <pause dur="short"/> but it's kind of outdoors <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="314" who="S0084">but even if he just became an odd job man</u>
<u n="315" who="S0083">working with things</u>
<u n="316" who="S0084">do you know what I mean? Like you know there's lots of people</u>
<u n="317" who="S0083">I know</u>
<u n="318" who="S0084">in the  in the  industry</u>
<u n="319" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="320" who="S0084">locally</u>
<u n="321" who="S0083">I know</u>
<u n="322" who="S0084">who just take on lads <pause dur="short"/> like my housemate like I think he's going about it the wrong way but he's just picked up with some guy and he goes off with him and they do the insulation on the outside of houses <pause dur="short"/> and he's just been knocking around with him</u>
<u n="323" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="324" who="S0084">and he <trunc>wor</trunc> he sort of so that means he's self-employed <pause dur="short"/> and if the weather's bad he doesn't work <pause dur="short"/> and I've been saying to him like why you know there is funding out there and there is help if you wanna get your City and Guilds qualifications</u>
<u n="325" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="326" who="S0084">and that means you'd be able to get a more reputable job</u>
<u n="327" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="328" who="S0084">on a building site <pause dur="short"/> and you'll have more</u>
<u n="329" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="330" who="S0084">um stability <pause dur="short"/> he was like yeah well I dunno if I wanna do it and you know he does complain that if he doesn't work <pause dur="short"/> and I think well do something about it <pause dur="short"/> but there are</u>
<u n="331" who="S0083">yeah but</u>
<u n="332" who="S0084">opportunities like that around</u>
<u n="333" who="S0083">but if <trunc>pe</trunc> if people want to do it they will do it <pause dur="short"/> it's he's not sure that's what he wants to do <pause dur="short"/> he doesn't wanna commit himself to doing something long-term</u>
<u n="334" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0083">it probably suits him for the time being</u>
<u n="336" who="S0084">well I mean</u>
<u n="337" who="S0083">A lot  a lot  of people drift like that</u>
<u n="338" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and he's done lots of different jobs</u>
<u n="339" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="340" who="S0084">but I think you know given that he's got a criminal record as well I think it</u>
<u n="341" who="S0083">mhm</u>
<u n="342" who="S0084">it's better to find something that you can do</u>
<u n="343" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="344" who="S0084">that's stable in the short-term <pause dur="short"/> and get a qualification that means you it will be stable rather than just here and there</u>
<u n="345" who="S0083"><trunc>W</trunc> well I agree but some people find it very difficult to stick to anything <pause dur="short"/> and they just do</u>
<u n="346" who="S0084">then er don't complain about it <pause dur="short"/> don't complain that you only work one day a week <pause dur="short"/> I think that's what I find like he's got quite a negative attitude <trunc>w</trunc> you know my housemate</u>
<u n="347" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="348" who="S0084">which I can't really cope with <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="349" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> it is difficult <pause dur="short"/> I mean I find  I find it difficult I find  it difficult suggesting things to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because he'll just say no</u>
<u n="350" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="351" who="S0083">but I do know that a lot of that is because he doesn't know <pause dur="short"/> it's not just no <pause dur="short"/> it's I don't know</u>
<u n="352" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="353" who="S0083">so we're working on it</u>
<u n="354" who="S0084">it's yeah I know I'm tut it is hard cos I you I can't empathize in that way <pause dur="short"/> I can't imagine what he's going through <pause dur="short"/> and I know it's hard for him <pause dur="short"/> you know I know that he is depressed and he must be pretty bad if they feel like they should medicate him</u>
<u n="355" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="356" who="S0084">given everything that he's already been through with drugs <pause dur="short"/> and I know that it's <trunc>re</trunc></u>
<u n="357" who="S0083">I think it helps</u>
<u n="358" who="S0084">easy for him to talk</u>
<u n="359" who="S0083">I think it's helpful</u>
<u n="360" who="S0084">to you about it because you've you've got more of an experience in that</u>
<u n="361" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="362" who="S0084">area <pause dur="short"/> you know dad and I can't appreciate how that feels</u>
<u n="363" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="364" who="S0084">but I suppose all you can do is really sort of be there for the person</u>
<u n="365" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="366" who="S0084">and that's what you try and do <pause dur="short"/> but it worries me obviously cos I <trunc>th</trunc> you know I I know it'll worry you the thought that what's gonna happen when you and dad aren't here to support him? Not that that's happening any time</u>
<u n="367" who="S0083">well absolutely</u>
<u n="368" who="S0084">in the short-term but</u>
<u n="369" who="S0083">no but er but of course it</u>
<u n="370" who="S0084">that's the worry</u>
<u n="371" who="S0083">it does <pause dur="short"/> I just assume that by that stage hopefully something will have happened for him</u>
<u n="372" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="373" who="S0083">and and I it's it's not just that <pause dur="short"/> you know even he is aware of time passing <pause dur="short"/> and wanting more in his life</u>
<u n="374" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="375" who="S0083">whereas he was happy at sort of nineteen to drift</u>
<u n="376" who="S0084">Cos you don't see the future <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="377" who="S0083">at twenty-six he's not</u>
<u n="378" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="379" who="S0083">at nineteen you think nothing's important and you can just drift along for <trunc>yea</trunc> forever</u>
<u n="380" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="381" who="S0083">but he's thinking now that that's not good enough</u>
<u n="382" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="383" who="S0083">well good for him for for realizing it</u>
<u n="384" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="412" who="S0084">I thought that's his</u>

<u n="458" who="S0084">knows her best</u>
<u n="459" who="S0083">but sometimes you you can't I mean I think it takes a a good writer to do that <pause dur="short"/> even if you know somebody really well to be able to paint a picture of that person for somebody else to get it</u>
<u n="460" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="461" who="S0083">complete <pause dur="short"/> but it's her to a T</u>
<u n="462" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Right</u>
<u n="463" who="S0083">absolutely spot on <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's just uncanny <pause dur="short"/> and I think it is his how good he is a writer to be able to do that <pause dur="short"/> because I think if I tried to do it I couldn't do it</u>
<u n="464" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think you're right</u>
<u n="465" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> and I like the way he describes how they  how they  work together</u>
<u n="466" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="467" who="S0083">so yeah I thought it was</u>
<u n="468" who="S0084">it was very moving</u>
<u n="469" who="S0083">er er as always <trunc>y</trunc> you know he he can combine I think that's that's quite a gift <pause dur="short"/> combine making something amusing and touching at the same time</u>
<u n="470" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="471" who="S0083">without going too far</u>
<u n="472" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="473" who="S0083">in either direction to make it really awful</u>
<u n="474" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="475" who="S0083">so</u>
<u n="476" who="S0084">absolutely</u>
<u n="477" who="S0083">I think he's he's got a very good touch like that <pause dur="short"/> no that's absolutely you know her character comes through in that</u>
<u n="478" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="479" who="S0083">and I can always hear his voice in his writing as well <pause dur="short"/> he's  he's very he's  very accurate in his writing</u>
<u n="480" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="481" who="S0083">you know  you know  that that's what a lot of writers have a problem with is finding their authorial voice</u>
<u n="482" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="483" who="S0083">she does lose it <pause dur="short"/> when when when I read some of her stuff I can <trunc>hea</trunc> I could I can hear her voice <pause dur="short"/> you know when she's writing the dialogue in the murder</u>
<u n="484" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="485" who="S0083">I can hear her saying what she's writing <pause dur="short"/> and it's just so accurate <pause dur="short"/> she really gets it sometimes <pause dur="short"/> and sometimes not so well</u>
<u n="486" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="487" who="S0083">sometimes she loses it</u>
<u n="488" who="S0084">well I suppose some isn't some of their stuff still</u>
<u n="489" who="S0083">no <trunc>wha</trunc> the the thing is I haven't read any of the stuff that he's thrown out</u>
<u n="490" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="491" who="S0083">or that she's made him throw out</u>
<u n="492" who="S0084">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="493" who="S0083">but the stuff that I have read <pause dur="short"/> that's his voice</u>
<u n="494" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="495" who="S0083">it's accurate <pause dur="short"/> so it I think that's why <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> works</u>
<u n="496" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="497" who="S0083">because it's it's completely natural</u>
<u n="498" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="499" who="S0083">he he captured <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> his voice and his character I think er you know did amazingly <pause dur="short"/> I know it's obviously what he's very good at doing</u>
<u n="500" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> absolutely</u>
<u n="501" who="S0083">but you know he painted himself as well</u>
<u n="502" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="503" who="S0083">and very accurately and sort of</u>
<u n="504" who="S0084">he was very honest about himself</u>
<u n="505" who="S0083">warts and all <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="506" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> he really was you know his frustrations</u>
<u n="507" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="508" who="S0084">both er with the bureaucracy surrounding you know people</u>
<u n="509" who="S0083">and with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> himself <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="510" who="S0084">and with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="511" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="512" who="S0084">so he was very honest about that and I <trunc>d</trunc> think</u>
<u n="513" who="S0083">I mean I think that's why it works</u>
<u n="514" who="S0084">though that's why people respond to it</u>
<u n="515" who="S0083">and <trunc>tha</trunc> and that's er absolutely <pause dur="short"/> but that's that is his voice <pause dur="short"/> it's in that is</u>
<u n="516" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="517" who="S0083">how exactly how he speaks about people <pause dur="short"/> so yeah</u>
<u n="518" who="S0084">and I suppose and that's what makes him different to a er to other well I don't read a lot of biographies but</u>
<u n="519" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="520" who="S0084">because usually in a biography it's just the one person that you're</u>
<u n="521" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="522" who="S0084">writing about</u>
<u n="523" who="S0083">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="524" who="S0084">but I suppose but maybe that's to do with you know normally you'd be writing a biography about a famous person <pause dur="short"/> or possibly</u>
<u n="525" who="S0083">possibly</u>
<u n="526" who="S0084">or someone well known</u>
<u n="527" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="528" who="S0084">so you might only want to tell about them</u>
<u n="529" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="530" who="S0084">you wouldn't wanna put yourself in it <pause dur="short"/> you'd want it to be objective <pause dur="short"/> like a a historical biography</u>
<u n="531" who="S0083">but I think no that's right <pause dur="short"/> but it works having the two</u>
<u n="532" who="S0084">but it works this way <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="533" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it does <pause dur="short"/> and he obviously enjoys doing it</u>
<u n="534" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="535" who="S0083">which is why he's done it <pause dur="short"/> and wants to do it again</u>
<u n="536" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I suppose it makes it quite personal doesn't it</u>
<u n="537" who="S0083">it does  it does</u>
<u n="538" who="S0084">yeah I do want to <trunc>w</trunc> read about <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="539" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="540" who="S0084">so yeah when you get that back from <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> or <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is it?</u>
<u n="541" who="S0083">no <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s got that <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s got V</u>
<u n="542" who="S0084">oh yeah</u>

<u n="545" who="S0083">what am I looking at? Monday <pause dur="short"/> that's the twelfth <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="546" who="S0084">hmm?</u>
<u n="547" who="S0083">nothing on then <pause dur="short"/> that's fine <pause dur="short"/> no it's fine</u>

<u n="550" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="551" who="S0083">so fast <pause dur="short"/> that is incredible <pause dur="short"/> I</u>
<u n="552" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="553" who="S0083">think it's the one upstairs</u>
<u n="554" who="S0084">oh is it?</u>
<u n="555" who="S0083">I think so <pause dur="short"/> cos the downstairs one is the one where they did all the work <pause dur="short"/> do you remember?</u>
<u n="556" who="S0084">they've done a lot of work to it <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> um so I think that's what it is <pause dur="short"/> but it sold really quickly</u>
<u n="558" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> do you know how much it went for?</u>
<u n="559" who="S0083">no <pause dur="short"/> actually I was just gonna look</u>
<u n="560" who="S0084">I didn't recognize the estate agent sign out front <pause dur="short"/> but you could look on Rightmove</u>
<u n="561" who="S0083">okay <pause dur="short"/> rightmove</u>
<u n="562" who="S0084">and just type in your postcode</u>
<u n="563" who="S0083">yep</u>
<u n="564" who="S0084">what do you reckon? About one eight one ninety? What did you pay? You paid one eight five?</u>
<u n="565" who="S0083">one no one eighty for this</u>
<u n="566" who="S0084">one eighty <pause dur="short"/> and you've got a bigger garden probably <pause dur="short"/> although theirs is on the end <pause dur="short"/> they might have a big garden</u>
<u n="567" who="S0083">yeah it's oh no <pause dur="short"/> no that's interesting</u>
<u n="568" who="S0084">hmm?</u>
<u n="569" who="S0083">it says ground floor</u>
<u n="570" who="S0084">oh maybe the family want to move <pause dur="short"/> they've only probably been there less than you've been here</u>
<u n="571" who="S0083">I know <pause dur="short"/> and it's one eight two five hundred <pause dur="short"/> that's ridiculous</u>
<u n="572" who="S0084">but they spent <trunc>loa</trunc> they must've spent loads of money on it <pause dur="short"/> they've ripped the kitchen out</u>
<u n="573" who="S0083">they've spent a lot of money on it</u>
<u n="574" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="575" who="S0083">and when I moved in <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> came round a couple of months after I'd moved in <pause dur="short"/> and he said he thought it'd gone up already</u>

<u n="580" who="S0084">maybe that's the market <pause dur="short"/> or <trunc>ma</trunc> that's obviously why it sold so quickly <pause dur="short"/> cos it was quite a bargain <pause dur="short"/> if they've put a new kitchen in</u>
<u n="581" who="S0083">yes <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> the garden is a hell of a state <pause dur="short"/> that's really not very nice at all <pause dur="short"/> very unkempt</u>

<u n="744" who="S0084">yeah it <trunc>i</trunc></u>
<u n="745" who="S0083">it's weird</u>
<u n="746" who="S0084">it's very strange <pause dur="short"/> you'd certainly be looking out of the window wouldn't you</u>
<u n="747" who="S0083">of course you would <pause dur="short"/> how bizarre</u>
<u n="748" who="S0084">so their priority is the TV not the life and nature outside</u>
<u n="749" who="S0083">and their  and their  charming urgh</u>

<u n="756" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="757" who="S0083">see <pause dur="short"/> it's all exactly the same <pause dur="short"/> that's the kitchen window <pause dur="short"/> that's the bathroom <pause dur="short"/> but they've got that as extra <pause dur="short"/> and they've got it upstairs as well</u>
<u n="758" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="759" who="S0083">er and that's that there</u>
<u n="760" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="761" who="S0083">so there's a window there</u>
<u n="762" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="763" who="S0083">it's weird isn't it</u>
<u n="764" who="S0084">it's a really strange set-up <pause dur="short"/> I dunno why they've got and</u>
<u n="765" who="S0083">that's very odd</u>
<u n="766" who="S0084">if if you'd had bookcase or something on that wall I could understand it <pause dur="short"/> because you</u>
<u n="767" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="768" who="S0084">don't have anywhere else to put bookcases</u>
<u n="769" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="770" who="S0084">but why would you have your sofas there <trunc>fa</trunc> just facing that</u>
<u n="771" who="S0083">no wait a minute <pause dur="short"/> that's why it's not all glass <pause dur="short"/> it's cos it's the <trunc>t</trunc> it is the top floor then</u>
<u n="772" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="773" who="S0083">right <pause dur="short"/> when I saw it was the downstairs one that's the one the other side</u>
<u n="774" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="775" who="S0083">that's the eighty-two or whatever it is</u>
<u n="776" who="S0084">oh well now now we understand</u>
<u n="777" who="S0083">so okay so now this right</u>
<u n="778" who="S0084">now we understand why there's no door</u>
<u n="779" who="S0083">okay <pause dur="short"/> so this is the upstairs one which is I thought it was and it's not the downstairs where they've done all the work</u>
<u n="780" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="781" who="S0083">so this is the one now this is going for two hundred and er they haven't or near enough</u>
<u n="782" who="S0084">and they haven't got a garden</u>
<u n="783" who="S0083">and they haven't got a garden</u>
<u n="784" who="S0084">and it's not very nice</u>
<u n="785" who="S0083">and it's not very nice</u>
<u n="786" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="787" who="S0083">well er I mean they've got the laminate floors <pause dur="short"/> people like that <pause dur="short"/> although I'm not mad about it <pause dur="short"/> but the kitchen is really odd</u>
<u n="788" who="S0084">it's really odd <pause dur="short"/> but you've probably got more per inch</u>
<u n="789" who="S0083">so that's why they've got their</u>
<u n="790" who="S0084">you've got more square <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="791" who="S0083">that's why they've got <pause dur="short"/> okay now the kitchens upstairs are different</u>
<u n="792" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they are</u>
<u n="793" who="S0083">because you haven't got the that bit of corridor to the front door</u>
<u n="794" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="795" who="S0083">you haven't got that <pause dur="short"/> so that is all kitchen</u>
<u n="796" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's not nice though <pause dur="short"/> I don't like the set-up of the upstairs flats</u>
<u n="797" who="S0083">no <pause dur="short"/> no I it's not as nice</u>
<u n="798" who="S0084">and there's no garden <pause dur="short"/> so yours must be worth more than that</u>
<u n="799" who="S0083">so it must be</u>
<u n="800" who="S0084">you've got a massive garden</u>
<u n="801" who="S0083">that must put another ten thousand on</u>
<u n="802" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="803" who="S0083">at least</u>
<u n="804" who="S0084">if you took five off for replacing carpets and stuff <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="805" who="S0083">the the downstairs one would always go for more</u>
<u n="806" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> absolutely <pause dur="short"/> well you've got that you've got a garden at least</u>
<u n="807" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="808" who="S0084">and you've got the biggest garden on the block so</u>
<u n="809" who="S0083">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> and it's nice as well <pause dur="short"/> I mean it might well it'll be even nicer when I've done all the things I wanna do <pause dur="short"/> but yes</u>
<u n="810" who="S0084">yeah but already it's much nicer than it was</u>
<u n="811" who="S0083">it is <pause dur="short"/> it's and it's much nicer than this</u>
<u n="812" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="813" who="S0083">that's why this looks odd</u>
<u n="814" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="815" who="S0083">Cos it's actually upstairs</u>
<u n="816" who="S0084">now we understand</u>
<u n="817" who="S0083">right <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="818" who="S0084">so um so that's a nice to have a ballpark</u>
<u n="819" who="S0083">and actually <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s doesn't look like that <pause dur="short"/> oh cos the sink is there <pause dur="short"/> that's weird</u>
<u n="820" who="S0084"><vocal desc="yawn"/> Yeah you'd think the sink would always be in the same place wouldn't you</u>
<u n="821" who="S0083">and where's the boiler?</u>
<u n="822" who="S0084">might be in the airing cupboard still <pause dur="short"/> might be really old</u>
<u n="823" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> maybe <pause dur="short"/> that's odd</u>
<u n="824" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="825" who="S0083">Cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s is like you know it's it's the galley kitchen</u>
<u n="826" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="827" who="S0083">it's same as mine</u>
<u n="828" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="829" who="S0083">I can't remember if he's got a thing there or not <pause dur="short"/> but it's just narrow like that <pause dur="short"/> but it's all the way along <pause dur="short"/> but it's obviously longer cos he you've got all this <pause dur="short"/> whereas we haven't cos of the front door</u>
<u n="830" who="S0084"><vocal desc="yawn"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="831" who="S0083">but then we have got that huge cupboard under the stairs which he hasn't got cos that's the stairs</u>
<u n="832" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="833" who="S0083">so <pause dur="short"/> but the kitchen is a bit bigger <pause dur="short"/> it is just you know you could</u>
<u n="834" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="835" who="S0083">there's room for one more set of cupboards or another appliance</u>
<u n="836" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="837" who="S0083">which I haven't got</u>
<u n="838" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="839" who="S0083">Cos you imagine if you didn't need to get to the front door</u>
<u n="840" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="841" who="S0083">you've got that</u>
<u n="842" who="S0084">yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> of course <pause dur="short"/> but I still prefer er this flat</u>
<u n="843" who="S0083">oh I er God yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I'd much rather be downstairs <pause dur="short"/> and I'd really miss my garden so</u>
<u n="844" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="845" who="S0083">so it's the upstairs one <pause dur="short"/> and it was going for nearly two hundred grand <pause dur="short"/> and it sold within a week</u>
<u n="846" who="S0084">wow <pause dur="short"/> well there you go you see <pause dur="short"/> so that's encouraging <pause dur="short"/> that let's you know</u>
<u n="847" who="S0083">well it is encouraging <pause dur="short"/> so if the one round the corner is only one eight two it must be in a hell of a state</u>
<u n="848" who="S0084">yeah it must be really old <pause dur="short"/> because that's not particularly nice</u>
<u n="849" who="S0083">look at that <pause dur="short"/> nearly two hundred grand</u>
<u n="850" who="S0084">Good grief</u>
<u n="851" who="S0083">well that's good for me <pause dur="short"/> I mean I'm really pleased</u>
<u n="852" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's good to know what yours is probably gonna be worth</u>
<u n="853" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> if we go to Rightmove</u>
<u n="854" who="S0084">oh yeah because do you wanna have a look at dad's postcode because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s flat is probably on the market now</u>
<u n="855" who="S0083">oh yeah</u>
<u n="856" who="S0084">Cos they've just put it up</u>
<u n="857" who="S0083">that's interesting</u>
<u n="858" who="S0084">his postcode is <anon type="address"/> </u>
<u n="859" who="S0083">hold on</u>
<u n="860" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="861" who="S0083">I was gonna show you this one</u>
<u n="862" who="S0084"><vocal desc="yawn"/> Does it have any photos of the inside?</u>
<u n="863" who="S0083">so here's the downstairs <pause dur="short"/> no it doesn't</u>
<u n="864" who="S0084">oh that's interesting</u>
<u n="865" who="S0083">and I think that's dodgy</u>
<u n="866" who="S0084">because it's really <trunc>w</trunc> ugly</u>
<u n="867" who="S0083">but look the garden is I mean it's big but it's really</u>
<u n="868" who="S0084">it's big <pause dur="short"/> well there's not you'd have to put stuff in wouldn't you</u>
<u n="869" who="S0083">it's actually</u>
<u n="870" who="S0084">unless you had a family</u>
<u n="871" who="S0083">it's actually not that big <pause dur="short"/> it's nowhere near as big as mine <pause dur="short"/> and it's really in a bad state</u>
<u n="872" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="873" who="S0083">really in a bad way</u>
<u n="874" who="S0084">but er you know first time buyers might think that that's really nice <pause dur="short"/> ground floor <pause dur="short"/> got you know you it's a blank canvas</u>
<u n="875" who="S0083">it's very it's a good investment</u>
<u n="876" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="877" who="S0083">it is a good <trunc>inve</trunc> you could go if you <pause dur="short"/> it hasn't sold <pause dur="short"/> so if you  if you  could get them down to one eighty now</u>
<u n="878" who="S0084">if then if you could get a ten percent mortgage that's doable isn't it</u>
<u n="879" who="S0083">and people  and people  would <trunc>g</trunc> but people would buy it and go in and do it up</u>
<u n="880" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos if you <trunc>r</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> cos that's twenty grand isn't it</u>
<u n="881" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="882" who="S0084">correct me if I'm wrong</u>
<u n="883" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="884" who="S0084">ten percent mortgage <pause dur="short"/> which is doable if er if it's a couple buying it cos</u>
<u n="885" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="886" who="S0084">then you just need ten just you've gotta have ten thousand</u>
<u n="887" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="888" who="S0084">and then you've probably gotta have five each</u>
<u n="889" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="890" who="S0084">to do it up</u>
<u n="891" who="S0083">but that's interesting isn't it</u>
<u n="892" who="S0084">but it'd be worth twenty-five grand more when you've done it</u>
<u n="893" who="S0083">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> always <pause dur="short"/> but yes when when it's I mean unless they <trunc>b</trunc> it <trunc>de</trunc> hmm if it's got a lot to do they have to really reduce the price</u>
<u n="894" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="895" who="S0083">to get somebody to buy it</u>
<u n="896" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="897" who="S0083">it depends if you think you know if you think you can do it and not <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>s</trunc> without spending too much</u>
<u n="898" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="899" who="S0083">then you're still gonna make some profit on it</u>

<u n="901" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it depends how big that margin is</u>

<u n="1016" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> it's only until the end of the financial year <pause dur="short"/> they just had some money to burn <pause dur="short"/> um that should clear my overdraft <pause dur="short"/> and at that point I start</u>

<u n="1028" who="S0084">so</u>

<u n="1046" who="S0084">I know <pause dur="short"/> but it</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0083">especially the size that they are <pause dur="short"/> I mean oh God</u>

<u n="1051" who="S0083">do they?</u>
<u n="1052" who="S0084">at least then <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> there are some schemes <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="1053" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1054" who="S0084">in the to in the part buy you can't rent it out <pause dur="short"/> you can't sublet <pause dur="short"/> that's the difficulty</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0083">right <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> if you're doing it that way round</u>
<u n="1056" who="S0084">so maybe you could do it to a mate or something <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1057" who="S0083">right <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> but typically if you were getting a mortgage on your own and you <trunc>deci</trunc> you decided to take a job abroad</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0084">you would just rent your flat out</u>

<u n="1063" who="S0083">absolutely</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0084">and then that's not a weight <pause dur="short"/> it's just something that's appreciating in value</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0083">that's true</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0084">back home</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0084">and you're off working somewhere else and someone's paying your mortgage</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0083">that's very true <pause dur="short"/> that is true</u>

<u n="1071" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0084">but it</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0083">that's true</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0084">but really it's a massive massive problem</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0083">it's a huge thing</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0084">starting a massive commitment <pause dur="short"/> and you're penalized for doing it on your own</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0084">you know if I was going in with a friend or boyfriend</u>

<u n="1094" who="S0084">I don't know what the best thing to do is <pause dur="short"/> but at least I can feel a bit more confident knowing that if I am putting money aside</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0084">at least then I can start thinking about what it is I want</u>

<u n="1103" who="S0083">oh dear</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0084">yep <pause dur="short"/> it's just impossible <pause dur="short"/> so you can't even I mean if you could borrow money to pay a deposit to get a mortgage</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1106" who="S0084">at least then you have money it's <trunc>mo</trunc> having the money up front</u>
<u n="1107" who="S0083">it is <pause dur="short"/> because that that wasn't a problem for a long time <pause dur="short"/> but it will be now</u>

<u n="1109" who="S0083">from now on</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0084">Cos obviously banks are worried about lending to people</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0084">quite rightly <pause dur="short"/> you know they were very irresponsible in lending</u>

<u n="1114" who="S0084">money to people who couldn't repay and then</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0083">well yeah but it's their fault</u>

<u n="1154" who="S0084">I can get out of my overdraft and I can put money aside <pause dur="short"/> it's better to be doing that</u>
