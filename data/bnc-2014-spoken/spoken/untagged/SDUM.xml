<u n="1" who="S0520">the thing about our lovely <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is that he's one of the most spaced out people I've ever met in my life</u>
<u n="2" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="3" who="S0520">and as a consequence he is I mean it's a little bit frustrating sometimes</u>
<u n="4" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="5" who="S0520">so for instance I will send him a design like a Photoshop document you know with all the designs on it or I'll send him a text that needs to go on the website</u>
<u n="6" who="S0519">yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0520">you know and I'll write him an email and it's all like it's got a title saying attachment for blah blah blah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0519">yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0520">design for <vocal desc="misc"/> you know so you can spot it in our inbox</u>
<u n="10" who="S0519">I love it</u>
<u n="11" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> does the same</u>
<u n="12" who="S0519">no subject</u>
<u n="13" who="S0520">no subject is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s classic style so that you really don't know what you're doing I'll do that</u>
<u n="14" who="S0519">they're just er <unclear/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0520">basically what you need to with this</u>
<u n="16" who="S0519">yes</u>
<u n="17" who="S0520">I give him you know step-by-step instructions about it</u>
<u n="18" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0520">I would say and I'm not exaggerating nine times out of ten he asks me to send it to him again after having been completely confused he'll be like erm you know several weeks later when it actually is getting done he'll be like oh and erm I'll need the design for <vocal desc="misc"/> and I'll say yes I sent that to you in a on</u>
<u n="20" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah yes on such and such a date</u>
<u n="21" who="S0520">on such and such a date oh I don't think no it's in my inbox yes it is in your inbox cos I sent it to you and I know that I did</u>
<u n="22" who="S0519">it's sent and all that stuff yes</u>
<u n="23" who="S0520">and that's problem number one and it does irritate me</u>
<u n="24" who="S0519">ah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0520">because I want to be doing the thing where it's like I've done that it's behind me</u>
<u n="26" who="S0519">I know</u>
<u n="27" who="S0520">I've crossed it off my list I've done it I've moved on</u>
<u n="28" who="S0519" trans="overlap">I know what I don't like</u>
<u n="29" who="S0520">and he is never almost never on the ball and he said this to us erm kind of as a not as a way he's not apologetic at all he says I can't do things unless I'm actually working on on it at the time it's basically not worth your while</u>
<u n="30" who="S0519" trans="overlap">so sorry don't bother sending it to me I'll ask you when I need it</u>
<u n="31" who="S0520">but you know really? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="32" who="S0519">I'm not very good with with that in one way in that they send me information in three weeks' time you will need to pay these people they don't know exactly how much yes yet but this is the invoice <trunc>es</trunc> guessing on how many days and hours we might and I think well I don't need the guessing information</u>
<u n="33" who="S0520">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="34" who="S0519">I need the real invoice</u>
<u n="35" who="S0520">yeah don't send me the maybe</u>
<u n="36" who="S0519">don't send me the maybe and then it turns out that they so I file the maybe just you know in case but I'm hoping I never have to retrieve it <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm and erm <pause dur="long"/> only they decide then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> could you tell me again what that amount was cos I've forgotten how much we and I'm thinking oh god so I have to trawl through</u>
<u n="37" who="S0520" trans="overlap">I know yeah no</u>
<u n="38" who="S0519">the thing that I didn't want to see in the first place please</u>
<u n="39" who="S0520">well this is the this is problem number one and <trunc>a</trunc> er and we just adore this person so we don't the other problem with him is in fairness he can't be <trunc>cri</trunc> he's not very good with critical criticism</u>
<u n="40" who="S0519">he's not</u>
<u n="41" who="S0520">not even criticism but like if you will say to him listen dear erm this is really annoying what I send you which I have done by the way when I send you an email with an attachment put it in a folder even if you don't do anything with the email</u>
<u n="42" who="S0519">it's got a name</u>
<u n="43" who="S0520" trans="overlap">and then you'll know</u>
<u n="44" who="S0519">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0520">that you've got the files that you need when it comes to the thing but he gets a bit upset yeah a bit defensive</u>
<u n="46" who="S0519" trans="overlap">mm I don't do that sort of thing</u>
<u n="47" who="S0520">well not he knows that he does it but he refuses to be apologetic and he refuses to try and change</u>
<u n="48" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0520">the way that he works and that's not as cool because we've all changed the way that we work you know some some like all of us have our things like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> can be too bossy</u>
<u n="50" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0520">and erm full on with that side of things</u>
<u n="52" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah erm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0520">and she offends people with her way</u>
<u n="54" who="S0519">the Greek people have gone off her</u>
<u n="55" who="S0520">the Greek people didn't like her at all and it it wasn't the first time that's happened in fairness she is she can be just a little bit I think some people find it patronising</u>
<u n="56" who="S0519">yes</u>
<u n="57" who="S0520">that she sort of assumes that you're working for her a little bit but she you tell her this and she's so</u>
<u n="58" who="S0519">can't believe that it's yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0520" trans="overlap">takes it in and is like really okay and I'm you know and she tries so hard to change the way that she does it and</u>
<u n="60" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yes I have to say it reminds me a bit of dad</u>
<u n="61" who="S0520" trans="overlap">she gets a bit upset but yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0519">he I'll hear him on the phone and he'll he'll laugh at people and I'll think I'm just <unclear/> in your eye</u>
<u n="63" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="64" who="S0519">and they that they kind of got to know that he's a nice man and he doesn't mean it and he's laughing and it's not hurtful you know but he's actually extremely rude</u>
<u n="65" who="S0520">offensive</u>
<u n="66" who="S0519">and when they don't know him you can sometimes hear the bristling</u>
<u n="67" who="S0520">ooh yeah definitely I've heard him on the phone as well and I've thought ow</u>
<u n="68" who="S0519">ow me too</u>
<u n="69" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/> he's just not realising that people are taking things offence like were taking offence on things</u>
<u n="70" who="S0519">yes you did what?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it's quite a skill to be sort of diplomatic with people isn't it? so anyway <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> erm has this problem and I think that's you know it's his Achilles heel really because you're not gonna improve as a person to a degree if you can't if if you can't respond well to negative feedback and it's not negative coming from me and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="72" who="S0519">no</u>
<u n="73" who="S0520">cos we're his like we're good friends of his and you know we really it's obvious that we have lot of respect for him by default it's you know it there's no there should be no issue there should be no question of that really so that just yeah so today he's been in top spaced out form so he's sending all these emails which are erm <trunc>proo</trunc> which are as a result of the fact that he's not read any of the emails that we've sent before and he's ask now he's asking the questions as if we've never spoken about it but we've sent about a billion emails on the subject to him personally and each other and he's obviously just not read any of them so we're back to square one with him you know and it's a little bit like and he's sending them all to the wrong email addresses and stuff <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's like so not on the case <vocal desc="laugh"/> I mean you can't he's one of those people that he reminds me a bit of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> do you remember <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you met <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0519" trans="overlap">I do yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0520">he was erm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0519">tell me that woman didn't put me two bits of butter for three pieces of fish <pause dur="short"/> in a bag that size you're kidding me <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0520">erm yeah <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was er quite similar in the sense of like he was just so nice</u>
<u n="78" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0520">but despite having these kind of things that he did which were difficult sometimes to deal with and also for the same reason that he was also just a very spaced out person you always forgave him no matter what <vocal desc="laugh"/> because you can't but love the guy <pause dur="long"/> I already said in the email you have to sort of bite your tongue a bit with the yes as said before in the <vocal desc="misc"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> as I've already done in <pause dur="long"/></u>

<u n="348" who="S0520">the first one he's doing the showing the evolution of man from the apes you know? that was his that's what the first programme's about and erm it's sort of it's quite funny because it's quite old-fashioned like you know the way it all looks and stuff</u>
<u n="349" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="350" who="S0520">he goes on the computer and it's like this <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="352" who="S0520">it was state-of-the-art then and the whole programme was probably really state-of-the-art you know the way they do the montages with the music and it's all very now it's kind of you recognise it but I think then it was all very creative wasn't it? anyway he he shows on the computer the how the skulls</u>
<u n="353" who="S0519">oh sorry</u>
<u n="354" who="S0520">erm the different skulls that they've found at that time I don't know what it's like now if they've found a lot mine but er skulls of the different</u>
<u n="355" who="S0521" trans="overlap">yeah it was interesting wasn't it?</u>
<u n="356" who="S0520">developments and one of the thing that he showed was that the three were like branches away from human from apes that developed into other types of apes and there was a a branch that developed into humans you know so</u>
<u n="357" who="S0521">mm</u>
<u n="358" who="S0520">some of them were meat eaters and remained so and they developed different teeth and a different jaw and and their brain changed and the main thing was the brain and the teeth which distinguished er development into human beings from other</u>
<u n="359" who="S0521" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="360" who="S0519">mm mm</u>
<u n="361" who="S0520">evolution of apes into other species of ape instead you know? that was the interesting thing that it was saying</u>
<u n="362" who="S0519">yeah</u>
<u n="363" who="S0520">so their brain specifically was growing much much bigger and their diet was changing I mean I think they they evolved from the I can't remember if this is true whether we evolved from cos they were were herbivores originally weren't they?</u>
<u n="364" who="S0521">yes they came down from the trees on to the savannah</u>
<u n="365" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="366" who="S0521">and then they started to hunt and the hunt obviously meant that they were having animal meat</u>
<u n="367" who="S0520">yeah and they were actually physically very small creatures and quite weak physically and that's why they had to develop</u>
<u n="368" who="S0521">develop tools</u>
<u n="369" who="S0520">tools in order to survive in the savannah environment</u>
<u n="370" who="S0519">and was it to cut up the meat as well?</u>
<u n="371" who="S0520">erm I don't think so no</u>
<u n="372" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="373" who="S0520">I think they cut the meat up did they? didn't they just eat it directly?</u>
<u n="374" who="S0521">no I think they cut it up</u>
<u n="375" who="S0520">did they? mm</u>
<u n="376" who="S0519">well</u>
<u n="377" who="S0520">they had like very very simple tools</u>
<u n="378" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="379" who="S0520">and the other thing that was interesting because of their physical size is that they had to hunt together</u>
<u n="380" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="381" who="S0520">so you know then you have like a social species as opposed to like cats for instance who are like more of individual species because they hunt alone</u>
<u n="382" who="S0519">yeah</u>
<u n="383" who="S0520">but we're like dogs because we hunt together</u>
<u n="384" who="S0519">yeah</u>
<u n="385" who="S0520">and then there's the sort of group the social behaviour starts you can see that even in the monkeys like if you watch the monkeys I watch them sometimes in India in the retreat place cos there's loads of them how they behave with each other they're completely social animals you never see monkey on its own doing it's one thing you know?</u>
<u n="386" who="S0519" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="387" who="S0521">right</u>
<u n="388" who="S0519">no</u>
<u n="389" who="S0520">and erm like dogs are like that as well and therefore they develop kind of an emotional like the difference between cats and dogs dogs are not are emotionally needy</u>
<u n="390" who="S0521">mm</u>
<u n="391" who="S0520">and they need like affection and communication in order to feel happy whereas cats</u>
<u n="392" who="S0519">a little but not much</u>
<u n="393" who="S0520">a little bit but not much</u>
<u n="394" who="S0521" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="395" who="S0519">a little but not yeah like Jay comes and sits on you</u>
<u n="396" who="S0521">Jay yeah</u>
<u n="397" who="S0520">but they are very domesticated pet cats aren't they?</u>
<u n="398" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="399" who="S0521">mm</u>
<u n="400" who="S0520">and they've developed the <trunc>di</trunc> certain different habits but in the end</u>
<u n="401" who="S0519">no a cat</u>
<u n="402" who="S0520">mostly alone</u>
<u n="403" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="404" who="S0521">I think they also they also think that the switch to meat er was part of the thing that enabled the brain to get bigger</u>
<u n="405" who="S0520">yeah they said that as well</u>
<u n="406" who="S0521">because the meat is much richer in protein obviously</u>
<u n="407" who="S0520" trans="overlap">different food yeah and then <pause dur="long"/> this was in Africa <trunc>orina</trunc> the originating then they migrated very long distances</u>
<u n="408" who="S0521">cos of climate change</u>
<u n="409" who="S0520" trans="overlap">why did he say that was?</u>
<u n="410" who="S0521">cos of the climate change</u>
<u n="411" who="S0520">cos of the climate change and then there was an ice age there were two ice ages and there were small groups of humans Homo sapiens let's say that survived the ice age</u>
<u n="412" who="S0521">mm</u>
<u n="413" who="S0520">but in order to do so they had to develop quite sophisticated techniques because they weren't built survive that kind of temperature so they started to live in caves</u>
<u n="414" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="415" who="S0520">and they started to migrate with the animals so like for instance they'd follow a herd of reindeer on their natural migration because the reindeer was their source of food</u>
<u n="416" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="417" who="S0520">so they just followed it</u>
<u n="418" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="419" who="S0520">and that's how kind of more of a nomadic lifestyle started to develop</u>
<u n="420" who="S0521">mm</u>
<u n="421" who="S0519">and also that the animals probably had the instinct of where to go that it was warmer or for protection from the winter and all that</u>
<u n="422" who="S0520">yeah it's altogether a good idea isn't it? to follow them but they didn't I mean humans don't have a natural migratory instinct</u>
<u n="423" who="S0519">no</u>
<u n="424" who="S0520">they're not migrating they're not a migrating species</u>
<u n="425" who="S0519">no</u>
<u n="426" who="S0520">they're just trying to survive er they what he's saying is that they started to consciously develop erm strategies of survival that weren't just inherent they weren't like you know a salmon swims up the river it doesn't decide to that's its</u>
<u n="427" who="S0519">no I see what you mean</u>
<u n="428" who="S0520">preprogrammed</u>
<u n="429" who="S0521">instinctive</u>
<u n="430" who="S0519">so there was a a definite choice</u>
<u n="431" who="S0521" trans="overlap">adaptive yeah so there's a certain kind of there's an element of conscious decision involved you know that that in in how they decided to and that's obviously a huge difference between</u>

<u n="444" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="445" who="S0521">which was on <trunc>af</trunc> was it Afghanistan? no</u>

<u n="449" who="S0521">and the the tribe was entirely dependent on cattle or whatever the animal was some form of cattle</u>

<u n="453" who="S0521">goats yeah</u>
<u n="454" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="455" who="S0521">erm his comment was that the fact that they spent all their time chasing goats that was their entire life and they had no time or energy left for anything other than survival</u>
<u n="456" who="S0520">he was trying to prove wasn't he? that the following step was to settle in erm stable communities develop agriculture</u>
<u n="457" who="S0519">develop a way of living without following</u>
<u n="458" who="S0520" trans="overlap">yeah exactly because nomadic life was so</u>
<u n="459" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="460" who="S0520">erm all <trunc>consu</trunc> the aspect of survival was so all consuming they had no leisure time they had no time to create anything and their whole lifestyle was based on what they'd done before what had been done and proven to work before they went on the same migration routes they made things in the same way they didn't need at any point to develop anything new and they didn't have time to so so yeah <trunc>pe</trunc> these people will stay the same and the idea is that we don't kind of thing it was kind of his theory wasn't it more than the facts</u>
<u n="461" who="S0521" trans="overlap">a little bit yeah</u>
<u n="462" who="S0520">but</u>
<u n="463" who="S0521">he did say it was his personal view didn't he?</u>
<u n="464" who="S0520">the whole thing is his personal view and</u>
<u n="465" who="S0519">yeah what's amazing when you look back and something like that is that probably he's very close to what people still believe and but he was it was quite extraordinary for somebody to have</u>
<u n="466" who="S0520">very influential yeah</u>
<u n="467" who="S0519">that theory then</u>
<u n="468" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="469" who="S0520">well it is a really interesting programme and erm</u>
<u n="470" who="S0519">I love thinking that in the seventies with that you know ludicrous computers and all of these things that they sent a man to the moon</u>
<u n="471" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="472" who="S0520">that's true</u>
<u n="473" who="S0521">in the sixties actually</u>
<u n="474" who="S0519">it it yeah it's hardly people didn't have a computer then did they?</u>
<u n="475" who="S0521">no</u>
<u n="476" who="S0519">erm at home</u>
<u n="477" who="S0521">just a research thing</u>
<u n="478" who="S0519">erm and they sent a man to the moon</u>
<u n="479" who="S0520">yeah that's true it's amazing</u>
<u n="480" who="S0519">it's extraordinary isn't it? so sorry yes I know that's a diversion</u>
<u n="481" who="S0520">no</u>
<u n="482" who="S0519">but er</u>
<u n="483" who="S0520">in the er the series that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I have been watching it's a not a documentary any more it's a drama series set in the sixties in America and it's been really popular it's called Mad Men</u>
<u n="484" who="S0519">ah I've heard of it I haven't watched it</u>
<u n="485" who="S0520" trans="overlap">yeah have you heard of it? yeah so basically it's about these this advertising agency in New York in the nineteen sixties and the whole series spans across a decade from nineteen sixty to nineteen seventy-one of the and one of the things that I think people like about it and that's made it popular is that it kind of shows the development in American society at that time which was so significant and erm it's really kind of they've tried to keep it very very real so for instance like the first episode you watch you're watching it's all set in an office so it's kind of like a professional environment</u>
<u n="486" who="S0519" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="487" who="S0520">and then they follow the characters home and obviously get you get involved in their domestic life as well but erm for instance like the way that they speak to woman</u>
<u n="488" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="489" who="S0520">and treat them in in that environment is like completely shocking</u>
<u n="490" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="491" who="S0520">and they don't you know they obviously tried to replicate exactly how it would be you know?</u>
<u n="492" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="493" who="S0520">erm but anyway the cool it's really that's a nice thing about because they there's so so many things happened in that decade</u>
<u n="494" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="495" who="S0520">that you know about as being culturally significant you know and inventions that were starting to happen and the whole kind of birth of consumerism really</u>
<u n="496" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="497" who="S0520">people this is because it's an advertising agency you kind of become aware of it of people wanting</u>
<u n="498" who="S0521">mm</u>
<u n="499" who="S0520">and brand having brand identity and stuff</u>
<u n="500" who="S0519" trans="overlap">interesting I <trunc>ju</trunc> I haven't watched cos I just thought it was all you know sex which I know is</u>
<u n="501" who="S0520">there's no <trunc>se</trunc> well there is I mean to be honest they it's not really not explicitly anyway the their lifestyle was quite hedonistic these in this specific er <trunc>bu</trunc> I can't speak properly at the moment this specific erm genre of business how do you say it?</u>
<u n="502" who="S0519" trans="overlap">inexplicit mm that'll do anyway</u>
<u n="503" who="S0520">so they did you know drink a lot go out partying and erm and cheat on their wives effectively so there is that element I think that's also more just a reflection of what they were what it was actually like because it was such an male environment as well</u>
<u n="504" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="505" who="S0520">and they went to work and it was as if they had a different life there</u>
<u n="506" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="507" who="S0520">that they could have the freedom to do whatever they wanted and then they went home and they had their family life and it was very very two very separate things and their wives were not</u>
<u n="508" who="S0519">aware of</u>
<u n="509" who="S0520" trans="overlap">involved or aware they were just like at home being you know a nineteen fifties housewife really and then there were some women in the office who erm gradually had started to you know be able to have an independent life but it was you know it was the sixties so like things did start to change</u>
<u n="510" who="S0519">the erm it it</u>
<u n="511" who="S0520">it's not that good I wouldn't like say watch it it's just</u>
<u n="512" who="S0519" trans="overlap">no <unclear/> a lot of people yeah a lot of people have said</u>
<u n="513" who="S0520" trans="overlap">in the way that it portrays it and I think it's kind of nostalgic</u>
<u n="514" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="515" who="S0520">I don't remember any of it obviously it was nostalgic of that time</u>
<u n="516" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="517" who="S0520">and it does make you think how there there are a lot of things that started out there that are very recognisable in our society</u>
<u n="518" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="519" who="S0520">the way people started to think about things and their values changed and so forth</u>
<u n="520" who="S0519">that's interesting</u>
<u n="521" who="S0520">yeah it was</u>
<u n="522" who="S0519">there was a a programme here which I didn't watch a lot of and it it it but it was a police series and it was set in the was it in the seventies? early seventies anyway erm and there there are a couple of women police</u>
<u n="523" who="S0520">mm</u>
<u n="524" who="S0519">in the office and or in the department and it's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>

<u n="532" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="533" who="S0519">so the er but similar to what you say absolutely shocking how they spoke to the women and how sexist they were and how erm belittling</u>
<u n="534" who="S0520">mm</u>
<u n="535" who="S0519">and that it was really really hard and the women of course just took it</u>
<u n="536" who="S0520">mm</u>
<u n="537" who="S0519">and had no choices about just taking it because that was the environment they chose to come into</u>
<u n="538" who="S0520">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="539" who="S0519">was the way that it's sort of put and also how the police treated other people</u>
<u n="540" who="S0520">mm</u>
<u n="541" who="S0519">like the criminals and whatever you know smacking them and hitting them and you know trying to get a confession out of them thinking that they were doing you know good a service to the public erm it was you know it it wasn't</u>
<u n="542" who="S0520" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="543" who="S0521">this is this the one with Martin Shaw the erm he he's the main guy and there's a young assistant</u>

<u n="546" who="S0519">erm</u>
<u n="547" who="S0521">cos that's very similar to what you described I don't know whether it's a</u>
<u n="548" who="S0519">yes I I think there might be one where it was specifically you know all the cars everything's very authentic</u>
<u n="549" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="550" who="S0519">it's all back in that time</u>
<u n="551" who="S0521">mm</u>
<u n="552" who="S0519">that's</u>
<u n="553" who="S0520"><unclear/></u>
<u n="554" who="S0521" trans="overlap">they were very <unclear/> in the seventies weren't they?</u>
<u n="555" who="S0520">mm mm</u>
<u n="556" who="S0521">that's our decade</u>
<u n="557" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="558" who="S0520">that's your decade even recently there was this thing I don't know if you read about it this woman lawyer so she's on this social media website called Linkedin which is like professional social media</u>
<u n="559" who="S0519" trans="overlap">oh I've just read it yeah</u>
<u n="560" who="S0520">thing so you put your profile but it's not like a social it's a professional thing so you put your CV you put your criteria and the idea is that you can be headhunted or you can connect with other people in your profession and that's the level of how it works you know? so this woman is a young woman in working in as a lawyer and she er somehow got in touch with this partner of one of the law firms in London and sort of middle-aged man probably in his fifties or sixties and erm he wrote her a message on this <trunc>we</trunc> website saying erm something like this might be completely un-PC but you look absolutely beautiful in your profile picture <vocal desc="misc"/> you know kind of that level of flirtation you know?</u>
<u n="561" who="S0521">yeah</u>
<u n="562" who="S0520">so she wrote back to him saying this is completely unacceptable behaviour</u>
<u n="563" who="S0521" trans="overlap">yeah I read that I read that</u>
<u n="564" who="S0520" trans="overlap">and you know misogynistic and you know this is how men assert their power over women in the workplace by reducing them to the the way that they look instead of their you know <trunc>coo</trunc> like a cool reply and then she posted it on Twitter the whole exchange and there was obviously a big frenzy at that point</u>
<u n="565" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="566" who="S0520">you know of people responding in different ways some people being extremely rude to her</u>
<u n="567" who="S0521" trans="overlap">bit over the top really wasn't it?</u>
<u n="568" who="S0520">and a lot of women saying good on you wish I could have done that because that's I encounter that kind of prejudice every day in the workplace and especially in the law erm industry where it's all an old boys' club essentially</u>
<u n="569" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="570" who="S0520">and it has been for a long time so you know it's there's some quite and it's like that in Cambridge as well you know that kind of thing is quite acceptable because it's all was a male environment for so long and it's still traditionally they're still <trunc>strut</trunc> it's still structured like that in a lot of ways you know? and like er you know there's one woman in the faculty of whatever as a token <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="571" who="S0521">gesture</u>
<u n="572" who="S0520">I didn't think I mean it seemed a little bit over the top but it's not like in as a single incident you can just brush it off and say whatever you know? the guy was just flirting with this good-looking girl</u>
<u n="573" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah she could have just said don't <trunc>sp</trunc> er make speak to me like that</u>
<u n="574" who="S0520" trans="overlap">but the fact that it <trunc>do</trunc> it is symptomatic of a certain type of wrong perception of what's okay</u>
<u n="575" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="576" who="S0520">you know and it seems as if like as a woman if you brought it up as and made and issue out of it it's like people'll go you know don't exaggerate</u>
<u n="577" who="S0521">right see what you mean</u>
<u n="578" who="S0520" trans="overlap">but it's an accumulation of those small things you know</u>
<u n="579" who="S0519">I know what you mean</u>
<u n="580" who="S0520">I do think that it was a good thing to do on her behalf and some people said it was career suicide as well cos she was just never gonna get</u>
