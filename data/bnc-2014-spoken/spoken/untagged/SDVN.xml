<u n="1" who="S0540">I'm really impressed</u>
<u n="2" who="S0541">it's amazing isn't it? <pause dur="short"/> I'll just put there and <unclear>we can get a</unclear> look at it but I mean</u>
<u n="3" who="S0540">yeah</u>
<u n="4" who="S0541">they're not interested in the <pause dur="short"/> content they're just <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> interested in the <pause dur="short"/> patterns <pause dur="short"/> of the speech so</u>
<u n="5" who="S0540" trans="overlap">patterns?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0541">yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0540" trans="overlap">oh my goodness</u>
<u n="8" who="S0541">well I think so</u>
<u n="9" who="S0540">how can they just pick up on patterns without recognising the content? because <pause dur="short"/> something must be <unclear>full of</unclear> patterns</u>
<u n="10" who="S0541" trans="overlap">well they're interested in the language so I guess they'll be looking for <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>y</trunc>you know <unclear/></u>
<u n="11" who="S0540" trans="overlap">verbs or?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0541">yeah like modern <trunc>ith</trunc> <trunc>u</trunc> maybe it's just modern usage of how language is evolving and what's <pause dur="short"/> spoken <pause dur="short"/> what people are saying <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>and the</unclear> words they're using you know?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0540" trans="overlap">so the fact that I'm Japanese and erm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0541">well that'll be interesting</u>
<u n="15" who="S0540">and <pause dur="short"/> you know I speak <trunc>Eng</trunc> er English as a second language <pause dur="short"/> I mean that must count</u>
<u n="16" who="S0541">presumably</u>
<u n="17" who="S0540">well should I just er explain myself</u>
<u n="18" who="S0541" trans="overlap"><unclear>explain</unclear> myself <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="19" who="S0540" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0541">no no no I I I don't think you need to worry about that I mean <unclear>I'm</unclear> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0540" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>probably</unclear> no <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and with</u>
<u n="22" who="S0541"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="23" who="S0540">you know eighteen pounds an hour I mean that's <pause dur="short"/> you know much better than erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> you know a lot of the jobs we can take</u>
<u n="24" who="S0540" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="25" who="S0541">tell me about it anyway <pause dur="short"/> let's move on</u>
<u n="26" who="S0540">okay</u>
<u n="27" who="S0541" trans="overlap">to our subject and erm</u>
<u n="28" who="S0540" trans="overlap">yeah yeah sorry <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="29" who="S0541">so erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> but er anyway so I came back and I applied for all these things and I got all these rejections and that's fine</u>
<u n="30" who="S0540" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0541">but then one of them came back and erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> and it's basically it's erm <pause dur="short"/> so I've been a bit up and down with it really so basically it's this kinda content producing company</u>
<u n="32" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0541">and they are doing this big project with Google</u>
<u n="34" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0541">and Google is writing a erm <pause dur="short"/> erm basically they're they're <pause dur="short"/> writing an entry on every <pause dur="short"/> single <pause dur="short"/> hotel <pause dur="short"/> in the world</u>
<u n="36" who="S0540"><vocal desc="misc"/> oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0541" trans="overlap">did I tell you? <unclear>I don't know if</unclear> I told you this</u>

<u n="39" who="S0541">no</u>
<u n="40" who="S0540">but <trunc>th</trunc> Google's actually doing that?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0541">well what they're doing I think</u>
<u n="42" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0541">is <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I think it's <trunc>ob</trunc>obviously to get revenue so that people then <pause dur="short"/> can search for hotels by Google <pause dur="short"/> and then <pause dur="short"/> the hotel will obviously pay them per click right</u>
<u n="44" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0541" trans="overlap">and then they will probably get a percentage when if it goes to a booking <pause dur="short"/> so it's</u>
<u n="46" who="S0540">oh I see</u>
<u n="47" who="S0541" trans="overlap">potentially quite a big <pause dur="short"/> kinda revenue <pause dur="short"/> earner</u>
<u n="48" who="S0540">oh right</u>
<u n="49" who="S0541">but anyway so this is a huge project</u>
<u n="50" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0541" trans="overlap">and erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> which is going on all over the world so they're recruiting <unclear/> writers and <pause dur="short"/> content producers</u>
<u n="52" who="S0540">oh fantastic</u>
<u n="53" who="S0541">all over the world</u>
<u n="54" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0541">to do this <pause dur="short"/> so and I basically did like some tests last week</u>
<u n="56" who="S0540">oh wow</u>
<u n="57" who="S0541">or last weekend or something</u>
<u n="58" who="S0540">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0541">and <pause dur="short"/> kind of got through those and now</u>
<u n="60" who="S0540" trans="overlap">what do you mean the <pause dur="short"/> doing a test?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0541">well they do they set like tests for you to see <pause dur="short"/> you know?</u>
<u n="62" who="S0540" trans="overlap">whether you can write</u>
<u n="63" who="S0541"><trunc>y</trunc> well <trunc>i</trunc> the have like it's like basically loads of instructions on <pause dur="short"/> different <pause dur="short"/> kind of <unclear>initial guides</unclear> and stuff like that</u>
<u n="64" who="S0540">oh okay</u>
<u n="65" who="S0541">so anyway <pause dur="short"/> so blah blah blah so I did that so I passed that and now I've got a week of training</u>
<u n="66" who="S0540">oh</u>
<u n="67" who="S0541">just starting today tomorrow</u>
<u n="68" who="S0540"><trunc>w</trunc>where?</u>
<u n="69" who="S0541"><vocal desc="misc"/> from home it's all remote</u>
<u n="70" who="S0540" trans="overlap">okay fantastic</u>
<u n="71" who="S0541">it's all remote so erm but then <pause dur="short"/> so anyway so I was kind of like <pause dur="short"/> and it's gonna go on for ages it's gonna on for like the whole of next year <pause dur="short"/> and they want a minimum of thirty hours a week <pause dur="short"/> or twenty-five hours a week <pause dur="short"/> or more</u>
<u n="72" who="S0540">so that means you know a proper full-time</u>
<u n="73" who="S0541">it's a bit of a nightmare and the pay's really bad <pause dur="short"/> but the pay's <trunc>n</trunc> I thought the pay was really really bad</u>
<u n="74" who="S0540">but it's not?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0541">based on the test that I did</u>
<u n="76" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0541">cos I had to write some sample ones and they took me <pause dur="short"/> like about an hour each and I was like oh my god</u>
<u n="78" who="S0540" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0541">and the rate of pay is appalling per hotel it's twelve dollars fifty</u>
<u n="80" who="S0540">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm mm mm mm mm mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0541">twelve US dollars</u>
<u n="82" who="S0540">oh my gosh yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0541">so anyway so I was like I can't do this it's terrible</u>
<u n="84" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0541">erm and then they came back and like they so I wrote them an email I said look I don't know if I can do this because of the rates</u>
<u n="86" who="S0540" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0541">and then they kinda <pause dur="short"/> they <trunc>k</trunc> have a table of kind of <pause dur="short"/> estimated kind of earnings and stuff and I said well <trunc>ha</trunc> you know have you got this because it <trunc>s</trunc>seems <unclear/> <unclear>and I was like er</unclear> basically it's based on historical data <pause dur="short"/> but now I've kind of look at it a bit more I kind of think maybe <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> maybe it's actually</u>
<u n="88" who="S0540">it's a little bit it's <unclear>it's easier</unclear></u>
<u n="89" who="S0541" trans="overlap">it's actually easier than I thought</u>
<u n="90" who="S0540">because you would able you would be able to kind of erm <pause dur="short"/> get <pause dur="short"/> get the knack of it and and</u>
<u n="91" who="S0541">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0540">be much quicker</u>
<u n="93" who="S0541">you're gonna turn into a robot I've turned into a robot with it</u>
<u n="94" who="S0540" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0541">but erm they're fairly short descriptions actually but the the time it's taken in <pause dur="short"/> looking at the information that's what what takes up the time</u>
<u n="96" who="S0540">yeah I see reading through taking in the information correctly</u>
<u n="97" who="S0541">anyway it's really boring but</u>
<u n="98" who="S0540" trans="overlap">and who's gonna check it <unclear>though</unclear> I mean what's the system behind it?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0541" trans="overlap">well the system behind it is that they're <pause dur="short"/> then I mean I asked that as well so I said oh you know?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0540" trans="overlap">well someone's gotta supervise it right?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0541">well they have all these editors I mean it's all remote it's all done <pause dur="short"/> via <pause dur="short"/> google so they're all</u>
<u n="102" who="S0540" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0541">you we're all working on a Google platform</u>
<u n="104" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0541">and kind of <pause dur="short"/> you know?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0540"><unclear>meeting the</unclear></u>
<u n="107" who="S0541" trans="overlap">it's an ambient ambient platform</u>
<u n="108" who="S0540">yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0541">meeting in kind of Google Hangouts</u>
<u n="110" who="S0540">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0541">and everything's like</u>
<u n="112" who="S0540" trans="overlap">in in the digital realm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0541">it's it's all completely in the digital realm <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="115" who="S0541">and then apparently <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and apparently so then it's written and we put it on to the <pause dur="short"/> content management system</u>
<u n="116" who="S0540">mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0541">and then it goes live and then I think there's random quality control so I might end up looking at somebody else's stuff and having to <pause dur="short"/> randomly edit it</u>
<u n="118" who="S0540">oh so you so you you are involved in the editing process?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0541">apparently I might have to do some of that as well <pause dur="short"/> but the training week which is this week</u>
<u n="120" who="S0540">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0541">which they're paying me <pause dur="short"/> like five hundred dollars for for like twenty hours <unclear>up to</unclear> twenty hours this week <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> you know? <pause dur="short"/> whatever <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> so I've <unclear>kinda</unclear> I've been going through the stuff today and</u>
<u n="122" who="S0540">it's better than nothing and better better than proofreading er PHD students you know?</u>
<u n="123" who="S0541" trans="overlap"><unclear>gonna love it</unclear></u>
<u n="124" who="S0540">it's thirty thousand bloody theses <unclear>as well</unclear> mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0541">so erm <vocal desc="sigh"/> so anyway so there was loads and loads and loads of material and <trunc>gui</trunc> star guides and lexicons</u>
<u n="126" who="S0540">yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0541">and like rules</u>
<u n="128" who="S0540" trans="overlap">I just <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> maybe the first month or so might be you know?</u>
<u n="129" who="S0541">hard yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0540">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but then you I I can imagine it should get easier <pause dur="short"/> if not boring</u>
<u n="131" who="S0541">I think the only problem with it</u>
<u n="132" who="S0540">yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0541">is that it's gonna it's <trunc>s</trunc>sort of thing that will drive me absolutely mental <pause dur="short"/> because it's very uncreative and</u>
<u n="134" who="S0540" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0541">it's just <pause dur="short"/> it's just like being a robot</u>
<u n="136" who="S0540">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0541" trans="overlap">it's it really is being a robot</u>
<u n="138" who="S0540">but on the other hand you would be actually getting to know you know <pause dur="short"/> all the hotels out there <pause dur="short"/> in a way</u>
<u n="139" who="S0541">I know but for what purpose? <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah I dunno what the purpose would be</u>
<u n="140" who="S0540" trans="overlap">mm no <pause dur="short"/> I know</u>
<u n="141" who="S0541" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean?</u>

<u n="143" who="S0541">yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0540">compared to what you you normally <pause dur="short"/> you know do</u>
<u n="145" who="S0541" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0540">it is <pause dur="short"/> you know you can say it's not creative</u>
<u n="147" who="S0541">it's terrible</u>
<u n="148" who="S0540">but you know what I mean</u>
<u n="149" who="S0541">it's soul destroying but on the on the <pause dur="short"/> plus side</u>
<u n="150" who="S0540">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0541">it means <pause dur="short"/> that <pause dur="short"/> I I'll have a guaranteed <pause dur="short"/> a guaranteed income so</u>
