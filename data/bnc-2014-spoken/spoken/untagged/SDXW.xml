<u n="4" who="S0278">I've never seen anything quite like <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't just went to fetch there was a urgency <pause dur="short"/> she went like a streak straight for him <pause dur="short"/> do you know today I had a seat where his crate normally is</u>
<u n="5" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="6" who="S0278">I opened the door he jumped up straight into the seat</u>
<u n="7" who="S0012">did he?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0278">he can't see at all can he?</u>

<u n="12" who="S0278">I know that <trunc>s</trunc> one one I thought oh you probably want me to come and get the seat</u>
<u n="13" who="S0012"><unclear>no it went</unclear></u>
<u n="14" who="S0013"><unclear>oh <pause dur="short"/> sorry</unclear></u>

<u n="25" who="S0278">well <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>le</trunc>let's have a look <pause dur="short"/> well the idea was to take off my garage door <pause dur="short"/> the front of the garage and put a window and <trunc>d</trunc> and doors in there in its place <pause dur="short"/> so that if I was working in there <pause dur="short"/> it's no good having a garage door cos the moment you open it all the all the heat comes out in the winter</u>
<u n="26" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0278">but I've found a solution for the winter cos I just in my I just work in my lounge</u>
<u n="28" who="S0012">well yeah it's the best thing</u>
<u n="29" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0012">you can do</u>
<u n="31" who="S0278">erm and that that's better than trying to heat up another area isn't it?</u>
<u n="32" who="S0012" trans="overlap">well of course it is yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0013" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>

<u n="40" who="S0012">stuff? that's not toxic the stuff you use the <pause dur="short"/> the glue or the what the cleaner?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0278">my <unclear><anon type="name" nameType="f"/></unclear> gets a bit excited about the the stuff I use for etching glass</u>
<u n="42" who="S0012">oh I see yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0278">she says I really should have a erm a fume cabinet that exhausts out through a tube</u>
<u n="44" who="S0012">oh I see</u>
<u n="45" who="S0278">erm and I could build one of those quite simply actually <pause dur="short"/> erm but the thing is I do it I do it in the open in the summer you know the <trunc>ga</trunc> the doors are all open and</u>
<u n="46" who="S0012">yeah</u>

<u n="137" who="S0278">quite amazing the <pause dur="short"/> cos I sat I <trunc>d</trunc> in the end I didn't use their their speakers <pause dur="short"/> they they're really just for voice the speakers they're <trunc>d</trunc> weren't doing music <pause dur="short"/> well they were doing it but not well enough</u>
<u n="138" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="140" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0278">there <pause dur="short"/> I got a wire run it right to the front and an adapter to stick it in the a microphone socket on the pulpit</u>
<u n="142" who="S0012" trans="overlap">oh I see yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0278">and it worked</u>
<u n="144" who="S0012">oh</u>
<u n="145" who="S0278">and actually we found out that one of their speakers hadn't been working for years</u>
<u n="146" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0278">it was painted over and the last time that was painted was donkey's years ago <pause dur="short"/> and the wire was under the paint <pause dur="short"/> and it was non-existent it was only one side of the wire</u>
<u n="148" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0278">the other half had been eaten at some stage</u>
<u n="150" who="S0012">we we've gotta chuck some speakers away did you want any speakers?</u>
<u n="151" who="S0278">oh don't chuck speakers please <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="152" who="S0013">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="153" who="S0278" trans="overlap">cos if I could fix up speakers in the church and just plug in that'd save me two things <unclear>to lift</unclear> it's if we don't <pause dur="short"/> if we haven't got an organist I can be the organ and we had the hymns that that were played by this guy found on the internet erm he was <trunc>us</trunc> was a</u>
<u n="154" who="S0012">just check</u>
<u n="155" who="S0278">organist at York Minster</u>
<u n="156" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="158" who="S0278">and he erm he <trunc>w</trunc> played the organ in a little church parish church up in the country <pause dur="short"/> and so it suits a small church <pause dur="short"/> and he</u>
<u n="159" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="160" who="S0278">was started there the year I finished the job he was getting on a bit but erm he did one CD which is popular hymns <pause dur="short"/> and he plays through the first line</u>
<u n="161" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0278">and then starts it</u>
<u n="163" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="164" who="S0278">and it's beautifully done you could actually hear him moving the stocks</u>
<u n="165" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="166" who="S0278">it's MP3 so it plays on that</u>
<u n="167" who="S0012">yes</u>
<u n="168" who="S0278">online</u>
<u n="169" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0278">and erm so I I did that for the hymns using these speakers <pause dur="short"/> but they're bit bit big to carry round</u>
<u n="171" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0278">erm and then at the end we got right to the end and I played a voluntary <pause dur="short"/> he had a voluntary done</u>
<u n="173" who="S0012">wow</u>
<u n="174" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="175" who="S0278">and the moment I stuck that on at the end of the service <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> turned to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and said who's playing the organ? and up until then he hadn't realised that they he well he perhaps thought the hymns were being <trunc>recor</trunc> were recording</u>
<u n="176" who="S0012">yes</u>
<u n="177" who="S0278">but when the voluntary came on</u>
<u n="178" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="179" who="S0278">he didn't associate that with anything electronic</u>
<u n="180" who="S0012" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0278">he said er who's playing the organ <unclear>it's him</unclear></u>
<u n="182" who="S0012">oh</u>
<u n="183" who="S0278">and isn't that lovely?</u>
<u n="184" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="185" who="S0278">so it obviously suited because it's must've sounded like that little organ in there</u>
<u n="186" who="S0012">oh</u>
<u n="187" who="S0013" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="188" who="S0278">yeah</u>

<u n="191" who="S0012">is he?</u>
<u n="192" who="S0278">he's a little bit uncertain on his feet <pause dur="short"/> someone gotta be with him all the time</u>
<u n="193" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="194" who="S0278">er <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> goes out <pause dur="short"/> erm she often asks me if I'll pop round just for half an hour</u>
<u n="195" who="S0013">mm</u>

<u n="197" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0278">and erm so it's good to sit with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> he's no difficulty to with at all he's <trunc>ha</trunc> you'd have a good old conversation with him</u>
<u n="199" who="S0012">yeah</u>

<u n="204" who="S0278">and I could leave them there that would be good and then I just <trunc>r</trunc> if I run <unclear/></u>
