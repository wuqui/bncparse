<u n="146" who="S0439">the erm <pause dur="short"/> well yeah the problem with well the thing is the problem with not having any signs <pause dur="short"/> is that by the by after a couple of hours every ruin looks like every other ruin and you kind of lose appreciation for what you're actually seeing</u>
<u n="147" who="S0481" trans="overlap">how big is the area?</u>

<u n="154" who="S0440">it's too late</u>
<u n="155" who="S0439">you can't go back out because they've in fact they erm <pause dur="short"/> they invalidate your ticket <pause dur="short"/> so you have to then rebuy a ticket to get back in <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> it's a joke but <pause dur="short"/> after walking around for a while it's a bit like <pause dur="short"/> every <pause dur="short"/> ruin looks <pause dur="short"/> a bit the same</u>
<u n="156" who="S0481">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0439">but it was really good it's it's miles though we <pause dur="short"/> we arrived at half past ten <pause dur="short"/> and we left at half past four I think</u>
