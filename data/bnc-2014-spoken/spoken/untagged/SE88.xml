<event desc="recording skips"/>
<u n="35" who="S0084">I think I got that tax rebate because from it was from working in Waterstones <pause dur="short"/> they'd taken too much tax</u>
<u n="36" who="S0083">oh that's right</u>
<u n="37" who="S0084">so I got</u>
<u n="38" who="S0083">they always take at least two years to</u>
<u n="39" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0083">catch up with you</u>
<u n="41" who="S0084">and they'd um well it was September last year <pause dur="short"/> so it would've been for the previous financial year which was when I was working at Waterstones</u>
<u n="42" who="S0083">okay</u>
<u n="43" who="S0084">so it <trunc>w</trunc> just took them <trunc>f</trunc> five months to work it out</u>
<u n="44" who="S0083"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Right <pause dur="short"/> tut</u>
<u n="45" who="S0084">um</u>
<u n="46" who="S0083">it took them about two years to give me my tax back</u>
<u n="47" who="S0084">some of er some of it is <pause dur="short"/> some of it does take that long <pause dur="short"/> I think cos obviously you can write to them and say look you er you owe me this money from this job and</u>
<u n="48" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0084">um on this date</u>
<u n="50" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">and they can sort it out more quickly <pause dur="short"/> but if it's just a case of you wait your turn</u>
<u n="52" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0084">till they get to you then</u>
<u n="54" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0084">no it does take a long time</u>
<u n="56" who="S0083">I suppose that's it</u>
<u n="57" who="S0084">so that was quite nice</u>
<u n="58" who="S0083">I'd forgotten all about it so it was a nice um</u>
<u n="59" who="S0084">and I wasn't expecting it</u>
<u n="60" who="S0083">bonus</u>
<u n="61" who="S0084">I just assumed that the tax was correct</u>
<u n="62" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0084">which obviously was foolish <pause dur="short"/> that was a hundred and thirty pound rebate</u>
<u n="64" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0084">so it could be that I earn this money now and maybe I see some of it later on or I don't <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I mean I I spoke to our finance team and they said no that's just how much it is</u>
<u n="66" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0084">you just have to pay tax and national insurance and all the rest of it</u>
<u n="68" who="S0083">I know</u>
<u n="69" who="S0084">so it just seems like er you know you <trunc>w</trunc> you do this work and then you only get half the money for it <pause dur="short"/> it's er simply unfair</u>
<u n="70" who="S0083">well you you don't get half the money <pause dur="short"/> you get more than that <pause dur="short"/> I mean what what what band are you on? Tax band</u>

<u n="72" who="S0083">oh no  no I don't  I don't know what the numbers mean but you know it's just</u>
<u n="73" who="S0084">well you can earn up to <trunc>si</trunc> seven thousand pounds basically per</u>
<u n="74" who="S0083">no no no <pause dur="short"/> sorry <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> you're on the lower rate of tax aren't you?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> because I only earn</u>
<u n="76" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0084">twenty-three grand so</u>
<u n="78" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's right <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="79" who="S0084">so you pay twenty per cent tax</u>
<u n="80" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0084">but you also pay national insurance on top of that</u>
<u n="82" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0084">and student loans</u>
<u n="84" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean the thing is you've got several things coming out of yours so er</u>
<u n="85" who="S0084">well out of my salary I've got my</u>
<u n="86" who="S0083">it just feels like it</u>
<u n="87" who="S0084">I've got yeah I've got tax <pause dur="short"/> national insurance <pause dur="short"/> pension <pause dur="short"/> and my student loan</u>
<u n="88" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="89" who="S0084">so I've got the my contributions to my pension and and the <anon type="place"/> contributions</u>
<u n="90" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0084">so yeah it's a bit um <pause dur="short"/> you don't see an awful lot of it <pause dur="short"/> even <trunc>w</trunc> so we thought they'd er <trunc>ta</trunc></u>
<u n="92" who="S0083">no</u>
<u n="93" who="S0084">er they'd calculated it incorrectly <pause dur="short"/> but no <pause dur="short"/> unfortunately it was correct</u>
<u n="94" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0084">tut <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> what are you gonna do? At least it's better than a poke in the eye <pause dur="short"/> and all you're doing is recording your own conversation so</u>
<u n="96" who="S0083">fair enough <pause dur="short"/> huh</u>
<u n="97" who="S0084">until it gets to the point when people just refuse <pause dur="short"/> which er it's not er that far away from now</u>
<u n="98" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0084">originally it was supposed to be the end of March <pause dur="short"/> but they've extended it until the end of April</u>
<u n="100" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="101" who="S0084">Cos they found they had more money to pay people <pause dur="short"/> or pay for the recordings <pause dur="short"/> so they've um extended the deadline</u>
<u n="102" who="S0083">well it gives the transcribers a laugh doesn't it</u>
<u n="103" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I went round to see <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> last night <pause dur="short"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s is one of the transcribers <pause dur="short"/> and I did</u>

<u n="117" who="S0084">I'd only be embarrassed if it were <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> and I've said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> can you er if at all possible make sure it's not</u>
<u n="118" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> fair enough</u>
<u n="119" who="S0084">so yeah <pause dur="short"/> so er you know it is it's really helping</u>
<u n="120" who="S0083">Good <pause dur="short"/> huh</u>
<u n="121" who="S0084">just <pause dur="short"/> huh <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> luckily <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was here to help me with my maths when I was <trunc>w</trunc> working on my master plan <pause dur="short"/> huh</u>
<u n="122" who="S0083">okay</u>
<u n="123" who="S0084">Cos I'd worked out that I could only save two hundred pounds a month <pause dur="short"/> and she worked out that it was actually four hundred and ninety-eight pounds</u>
<u n="124" who="S0083">oh my God</u>
<u n="125" who="S0084">or four hundred and seventy-eight <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="126" who="S0083">oh that's really good</u>
<u n="127" who="S0084">so to round it up to five hundred I'll just have to use the car less <pause dur="short"/> so I was budgeting for my loans going out and food and spending money and</u>
<u n="128" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0084">petrol <pause dur="short"/> and I'd said to fill up the tank a month is sixty pounds <pause dur="short"/> so if I only put fifty pounds in and don't use it as much</u>
<u n="130" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0084">then that should be fine</u>
<u n="132" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0084">and <unclear/> quite a lot</u>
<u n="134" who="S0083">I mean you don't need to use it as much <pause dur="short"/> and it's the summer</u>
<u n="135" who="S0084">I don't need to <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0083">so you should be cycling more</u>
<u n="137" who="S0084">er yeah I I am <pause dur="short"/> and I'm gonna leave the car in the garage on a Sunday night rather than you know be lazy and leave it on the drive <pause dur="short"/> and then it comes to the morning and I think oh I'll just get in the car</u>
<u n="138" who="S0083">no <pause dur="short"/> I think you should put it away</u>
<u n="139" who="S0084">I'm gonna put it away so it's out of temptation</u>
<u n="140" who="S0083">absolutely</u>
<u n="141" who="S0084">plus I worked out that my route to work is three and a half miles</u>
<u n="142" who="S0083">right</u>
<u n="143" who="S0084">so every day I cycle seven miles</u>
<u n="144" who="S0083">that's very good</u>
<u n="145" who="S0084">so per week that's thirty-five miles <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> So</u>
<u n="146" who="S0083">well that's really good</u>
<u n="147" who="S0084">so that's really good <pause dur="short"/> so I need to get back into it</u>
<u n="148" who="S0083">that's very good exercise for you</u>
<u n="149" who="S0084">it's really really good <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> er because I never think of it as being that far but er you know it is</u>
<u n="150" who="S0083">it is</u>
<u n="151" who="S0084">so yeah <pause dur="short"/> so that's good</u>
<u n="152" who="S0083">it is</u>
<u n="153" who="S0084">so I need to do that more really <pause dur="short"/> stop being lazy <pause dur="short"/> huh</u>
<u n="154" who="S0083">mhm <pause dur="short"/> well er er you know if you just drive to work once a week</u>
<u n="155" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> or er or the days when I'm going out in the evening <pause dur="short"/> that's when it usually is</u>
<u n="156" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0084">if I'm going out somewhere or if I've thought oh I'll come round here for lunch</u>
<u n="158" who="S0083">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="159" who="S0084">or whatever</u>
<u n="160" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0084">I'll just</u>
<u n="162" who="S0083">that's different isn't it</u>
<u n="163" who="S0084">try and not do that really <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>s</trunc> saw <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> on Wednesday when we went to <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="164" who="S0083">mhm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0084">and she's booked her tickets to Australia <pause dur="short"/> did I tell you?</u>
<u n="166" who="S0083">really?</u>
<u n="167" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0083">so she's definitely going?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0084">she's definitely going <pause dur="short"/> she's going well her job was always gonna finish in June cos she's maternity cover</u>
<u n="170" who="S0083">right</u>
<u n="171" who="S0084">it's really cheeky actually the way they've done it <pause dur="short"/> cos the woman who went away left obviously a year ago</u>
<u n="172" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0084">so she got all of the summer off last year</u>
<u n="174" who="S0083">oh right <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="175" who="S0084">and then she'll come back and only do half a term</u>
<u n="176" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0084">and then have it off again <pause dur="short"/> so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who has worked all year doesn't get um doesn't get paid over the summer <pause dur="short"/> but she has to do all the reports because she's been working there most of the year</u>
<u n="178" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="179" who="S0084">so it's pretty pretty unfair on her <pause dur="short"/> so she's booked her  booked her  tickets for the tenth of June I think she said <pause dur="short"/> and then she's off <pause dur="short"/> she's flying into <anon type="place"/> of all places <pause dur="short"/> I think because there's a tenuous link to somebody or other there</u>
<u n="180" who="S0083">mhm</u>

<u n="967" who="S0083">oh God</u>
<u n="968" who="S0084">a bed and a duvet <pause dur="short"/> and she ran away er before he woke up <pause dur="short"/> but um apparently because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s back living there as well at the moment because <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s in Italy <pause dur="short"/> so she's in the granny annexe</u>
<u n="969" who="S0083">oh right <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>

<u n="971" who="S0083">oh dear</u>
<u n="972" who="S0084">but that's sort of par for the course now <pause dur="short"/> apparently <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> took him to back to the <anon type="place"/> cos he's got pre-cancerous cells</u>
<u n="973" who="S0083">tut</u>
