<u n="254" who="S0208" trans="overlap">no but <trunc>al</trunc>also what really irritates me is like suicide like that is someone's choice</u>
<u n="255" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0208">they can do what they want but he probably wouldn't have done that <pause dur="short"/> if it wasn't for this guy's influence and yeah being a paedophile's wrong anywhere like always face the consequence like if you're he's obviously aware like he said in the messages he knew that it was dangerous and that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="257" who="S0202">yeah he knew that what he were doing were wrong</u>
<u n="258" who="S0208">but like it's it's not <pause dur="short"/> you know what I actually think I think that they should have the police there when the person comes so like do all the dirty work</u>
<u n="259" who="S0202" trans="overlap">just arrest them</u>
<u n="260" who="S0208">the things that cost money and time and that the police can't do have the police there and they can arrest them there and then</u>
<u n="261" who="S0202">but the thing is Stinson can't do it if he doesn't put it on the internet cos people won't give him money for it</u>
<u n="262" who="S0208">mm <pause dur="short"/> it just</u>
<u n="263" who="S0202">cos the thing is as well</u>
<u n="264" who="S0208" trans="overlap">I agree with what he's doing</u>
<u n="265" who="S0202">like all of them will be on benefits</u>
<u n="266" who="S0208">yeah</u>
<u n="267" who="S0202">every single one of them people who were part of Stinson's team will be on benefits</u>
<u n="268" who="S0208">but like I really do agree with what he's doing I mean dedicating his life to fighting crime after being <pause dur="short"/> like after committing a crime himself</u>
<u n="269" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah I agree with it yeah <pause dur="short"/> of course</u>
<u n="270" who="S0208">like that is great redemption but the fact of the matter is</u>
<u n="271" who="S0202">it's the way he's going about it that's wrong</u>
<u n="272" who="S0208">yeah and like it's not illegal but it's I don't think right <pause dur="short"/> I I do agree like yeah attract them bring them over to arrest them by all means but</u>
<u n="273" who="S0202" trans="overlap">I agree with what he's doing</u>
<u n="274" who="S0208">like you don't have to put online and ruin not only that person's life but <pause dur="short"/> everyone around him</u>
<u n="275" who="S0202" trans="overlap">everyone attached to them</u>
<u n="276" who="S0208">cos like like like I was saying like I would not be able to live with it if ever I found out that my dad was a <trunc>pae</trunc> I literally could not live with that on my conscience</u>
<u n="277" who="S0202" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> you wouldn't want to know would you?</u>
<u n="278" who="S0208">no ignorance is <pause dur="short"/> is bliss</u>
<u n="279" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="280" who="S0208">like as long as he was taken to justice or whatever I wouldn't want to have anything to do with it</u>
<u n="281" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="282" who="S0208">and I wouldn't want to be affiliated and be known as the paedophile's daughter</u>
<u n="283" who="S0202">mm <pause dur="short"/> cos it's not just the paedophile's life that he's affecting it's all of the family what if they've got kids? what if they're in secondary school?</u>
<u n="284" who="S0208" trans="overlap"><unclear>that</unclear> those children</u>
<u n="285" who="S0202">and like everyone sees it on Facebook oh like your dad's a paedo and their life is now a misery because of what the dad's done</u>
<u n="286" who="S0208">exactly <pause dur="short"/> exactly and the there's always those stupid ignorant people who think that it's like hereditary or whatever</u>
<u n="287" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="288" who="S0208" trans="overlap">so like oh your dad's a paedophile so you're going to grow up to be one it's like that's not how it works</u>
<u n="289" who="S0202">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it is it is wrong they shouldn't have put it on the internet full stop <pause dur="short"/> I really don't agree with that I really don't agree with it at all</u>
<u n="290" who="S0208">I think it's quite despicable</u>
<u n="291" who="S0202">it is because yeah what they've done is wrong and yeah they do deserve to be named and shamed but when they've been in court <pause dur="short"/> when they've been to court they've been prosecuted they're going to prison or they're paying a fine or whatever it is that happens</u>
<u n="292" who="S0208">yeah</u>
<u n="293" who="S0202">then it's up to the police and the press to to do that</u>
<u n="294" who="S0208">yeah and like okay the police don't always have the time and the resources to do it but the law enforcement is there for a reason they're the ones that are trained and know how to deal with it correctly</u>
<u n="295" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="long"/> but what I don't understand this Stinson hunter guy has been going around for ages doing this why is he not given the training that he needs? like why is he not training if they if they <trunc>w</trunc>why don't they say to him you're gonna do this regardless of whatever so let us give you some training?</u>
<u n="296" who="S0208">yeah</u>
<u n="297" who="S0202">like and we're going to show you how</u>
<u n="298" who="S0208" trans="overlap">or work for us</u>
<u n="299" who="S0202">yeah we're going to show you how to do it properly</u>
<u n="300" who="S0208">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that is one thing like people even today like no one is in agreement about how you treat things like that</u>
<u n="301" who="S0202">no <pause dur="short"/> but I <trunc>in</trunc>internet is wrong I think if you put it on the internet before they've been to court or anything like that <pause dur="short"/> is wrong</u>
<u n="302" who="S0208" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="long"/> cos like what if someone sees it on the internet and decides to deal with it themselves and goes and kills them?</u>
<u n="303" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="304" who="S0208">they then become a criminal <pause dur="short"/> it's not their place to do that I'm sorry like no matter how awful someone is to you two wrongs don't make a right like you don't just go and kill someone</u>
