<u n="550" who="S0635">yeah I do remember yeah we sort of came up it was <pause dur="short"/> cos there's another highway more in slightly more inland from Route one</u>
<u n="551" who="S0632">mm</u>

<u n="557" who="S0632">so yeah cos there were all these different campsites there was</u>

<u n="562" who="S0635" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="563" who="S0632">it was like the hardest ever <pause dur="short"/> what's the word? I can't think cos I'm full of <unclear>coal</unclear></u>
<u n="564" who="S0635">er</u>
<u n="565" who="S0632"><trunc>p</trunc> not puzzle I guess puzzle will do</u>

<u n="571" who="S0632">no one was on duty</u>
<u n="572" who="S0635" trans="overlap">for one reason or <trunc>ano</trunc> I think it was hard to find in the first place er and then like we maybe drove around the whole kind of area like the state park and we found the main campsite but not no we didn't even find the main campsite did we? like it was all really hard to find</u>
<u n="573" who="S0632">we did eventually find a campsite but we were like</u>
<u n="574" who="S0635" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="575" who="S0632">like well we're not pitched here cos we're pitched in the like I can't remember what they called them but like solo</u>
<u n="576" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="577" who="S0632">campsites where you're the only person for a mile</u>
<u n="578" who="S0635">uhu</u>

<u n="580" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="581" who="S0632">but and we were looking at the map and there was nothing on there called ST seven but there was deer and badger and rattlesnake and and eventually we somehow worked out that like badger must be ST one and you <trunc>kn</trunc> like there was a code and there was a name and they weren't often put in the same place</u>
<u n="582" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="583" who="S0632">and I think and some place somehow we found both the names together so we could work out that our booking was actually</u>
<u n="584" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="585" who="S0632" trans="overlap">called badger</u>
<u n="586" who="S0635">it was a tiny</u>
<u n="587" who="S0632" trans="overlap">and then looked for badger</u>
<u n="588" who="S0635">it was a tiny photocopied hand-drawn handwritten map on a pin board in the in the park and that without that like we'd have just never found it</u>
<u n="589" who="S0632">and that was like miles away from</u>
<u n="590" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="591" who="S0632">the main campsite as well wasn't it?</u>
<u n="592" who="S0635">uhu</u>

<u n="594" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="595" who="S0632">and you could see it highlighted</u>
<u n="596" who="S0635">uhu</u>

<u n="598" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="599" who="S0632">and then it said ST one badger</u>
<u n="600" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="601" who="S0632">and it was like oh so ST one is badger and badger is up there but not before we'd already pitched in the wrong place and had people come and tell us we couldn't pitch there cos it was their pitch</u>
<u n="602" who="S0635">yeah it was like looking for a Post-it note in a national park literally</u>
<u n="603" who="S0632"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and</u>
<u n="604" who="S0635" trans="overlap">but we did actually get there after expending too much energy but we did yeah and we got up</u>
<u n="605" who="S0632">yeah</u>
<u n="606" who="S0635">got up the hill and</u>

<u n="608" who="S0635">it was</u>
<u n="609" who="S0632">you had to drive as close as you could park your car and then hike well we'd already done that once in the wrong place</u>
<u n="610" who="S0635">yeah so then we had to go back up unpack go back down again <pause dur="short"/> and load up the car go to the next one and then go back up and <trunc>c</trunc> and <trunc>p</trunc> I mean we ended up doing the hike maybe like <vocal desc="laugh"/> seven or eight times I think in one yeah</u>
<u n="611" who="S0632" trans="overlap">I was so tired I was so tired</u>
<u n="612" who="S0635">uhu</u>

<u n="622" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="623" who="S0632">but instead we were like racing the sunset and I was so tired</u>
<u n="624" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="625" who="S0632">that was just that was like that was probably the lowest point</u>
<u n="626" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="627" who="S0632">of the trip because on the whole it was a brilliant trip and even that</u>
<u n="628" who="S0635">uhu</u>

<u n="634" who="S0635">uhu</u>
<u n="635" who="S0632">but we spent like over an hour looking for our pitch and then probably another two hours pitching and re-pitching in the right place</u>
<u n="636" who="S0635">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="637" who="S0632" trans="overlap">but anyway I was quite happy because we did actually make it the thing is I wish we were staying for more than one night cos we stayed for one night and we woke up in the morning after all the <vocal desc="misc"/> and barking noises all night</u>

<u n="1154" who="S0635">dry dry dry and dry I mean it wasn't really a very pleasurable drive for the first hour or two maybe? like it was like the sort of area outside of California</u>

<u n="1156" who="S0635">like big it just seems like big towns kind of <pause dur="short"/> endless it seemed like a kind of rough places I dunno they just seemed like harsh places to live like very hot dry</u>
<u n="1157" who="S0632">mm</u>
<u n="1158" who="S0635">boxy buildings</u>
<u n="1159" who="S0632">yeah cos there were little towns even</u>
<u n="1160" who="S0635">mm</u>
<u n="1161" who="S0632">quite far out in the desert and it just didn't seem like a fun place to live</u>
<u n="1162" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="1163" who="S0632">quite rough looking and freight trains just hurdling through</u>
<u n="1164" who="S0635">uhu</u>

<u n="1171" who="S0632">and they</u>
<u n="1172" who="S0635" trans="overlap">I think cos of all the trains</u>

<u n="1202" who="S0635">no</u>
<u n="1203" who="S0632">so but it was totally worth it was just</u>
<u n="1204" who="S0635">uhu</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0632">everything and more that I</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0635">uhu</u>

<u n="1208" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0632">and there weren't too many people there</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0635">no</u>

<u n="1217" who="S0632" trans="overlap">it's too hot</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0635" trans="overlap">and I think the caretaker kind of has to be there but</u>

<u n="1777" who="S0632">to get that place in Yosemite that we did get</u>
<u n="1778" who="S0635">yeah</u>

<u n="1789" who="S0632">yeah I suppose at least that was one of the upsides to going out of a national park was that you could get that sort of thing sorted at the mall</u>
<u n="1790" who="S0635">yeah and they did fix it reasonably fast and we erm <pause dur="short"/> we did we did a bit of shopping for our families didn't we? we got it out of the way</u>
