<u n="1100" who="S0079">actually yeah cos presumably if they bought the property the drugs came with the property <pause dur="short"/> therefore they'd actually been trading in illegal substances</u>

<u n="1124" who="S0105">to line and then they go to the shop</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0155">chop it up with your credit card</u>

<u n="1146" who="S0145">yeah</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0105">I think I'd prefer to have tinted windows in that sort of area <pause dur="short"/> cos they don't know how many people are in the car</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0141">ah that's true</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0105">whereas they would just think it's you they're more likely to hijack or I nearly got hijacked the other day</u>

<u n="1162" who="S0141">that's awful isn't it?</u>
<u n="1163" who="S0059">I I had a really bad incident on the way home from work on the A fourteen <pause dur="short"/> I was in the fast lane but was going with the flow of the fast lane traffic <pause dur="short"/> so I was going at seventy and was overtaking slowly and and this car came up behind me and he was driving so close to me and I couldn't really pull in to the slow lane cos we were going past lorries and</u>
<u n="1164" who="S0155">people are so stupid</u>
<u n="1165" who="S0059"><unclear/> and I had safe stopping distance in front of me but I wasn't leaving a ridiculous amounts of space <pause dur="short"/> and he started flashing his lights honking his horn he was trying to go round me on the hard shoulder <pause dur="short"/> he then tried to undertake me and so nearly crashed because I was just overtaking this car and he tried to squeeze this gap and realised it was really stupid and they were like hand you know firm on the honk <pause dur="short"/> what's it called?</u>
<u n="1166" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">horn</u>
<u n="1167" who="S0059">horn <pause dur="short"/> and I went oh I'm just driving along being like I don't know what to do and as soon as I could I pulled in into the slow lane and then he came in front of me and slammed on his breaks and I so nearly went into the back of him</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0141">oh I hate when people do that</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0059">and I had to slam on my brakes and I was really worried because I had a lorry behind me and he took the next exit off anyway <pause dur="short"/> so stressful</u>
<u n="1170" who="S0141">oh</u>
<u n="1171" who="S0155">people are just so stupid</u>
<u n="1172" who="S0059">and I don't know what I wasn't doing anything wrong like</u>

<u n="1174" who="S0106">what he overtook you to brake test you?</u>
<u n="1175" who="S0141">well yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="1176" who="S0059">he he probably wanted me to go in the back of him because if you go into the back of someone you're</u>

<u n="1178" who="S0059">your your it's your fault</u>

<u n="1180" who="S0059">yeah</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0109">yeah but then that would have slowed him down as well</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0059">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it would have been quite inconvenient for him</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0106">cars like doing that <pause dur="short"/> like when you're cycling cars always need to be first at the traffic light <pause dur="short"/> they need to accelerate to overtake you to get to the red traffic lights first</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0141">yes and then you just go in front</u>

<u n="1193" who="S0155">that's fine</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0106">I don't go in front of them <pause dur="short"/> I just stay in the traffic but that annoys the cars behind me cos they think that they can go <unclear/></u>
<u n="1195" who="S0145">yeah no I was</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0079">you see I'm I'm I'm with you <pause dur="short"/> if I think there's a driver who is em will cause problems I defensively block him so I can front overtake and I think that's what I can do</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0155">yeah</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0059">but he could just ram you off the road</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0145">yeah well I almost happened the other week</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0079" trans="overlap">but he won't</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0145">Cos I was cycling down and the same taxi pulled out like just suddenly pulled out and then as you know there's a cycle lane <pause dur="short"/> it's only just enough for a bike and a car <pause dur="short"/> but he kept on just drifting left and pushing me in and then <trunc>sudden</trunc> like then suddenly braked and turn left into a road and he'd and then <pause dur="short"/> I was going left as well and then he went through a red light and he's like he just made three massive systematic errors and it's a taxi</u>

<u n="1204" who="S0155" trans="overlap">I bet that <pause dur="short"/> that vast majority of people wouldn't notice that they don't realise what they're doing I suspect <pause dur="short"/> it would be really interesting to video people and you know sorry stop them</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0145">yeah</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0155">and say do you realise how badly you were driving? No no no I wasn't I was driving really well and then show them the video</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0145">yeah</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0155">and they'd realise</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0079" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0145" trans="overlap">he would <trunc>re</trunc> go through red light though</u>

<u n="1212" who="S0109">yeah</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0155">A white van cut it up and just imagine him saying cyclists are all terrible terrible and you know <pause dur="short"/> but I was in the right and he was in the wrong but he would bet he thinks cyclists are always wrong</u>
