<u n="11" who="S0084">is that cos you're hung-over or you just haven't had a chance to get any word in?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0041">yeah well or if I put words in <pause dur="short"/> you know I'm like I try and <pause dur="short"/> I'm not very good at the the touchy feeling conversations</u>
<u n="13" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0041">so he's saying to me that she <trunc>re</trunc> you know she's been on her on own for single for so long that she didn't eh <pause dur="short"/> she just wanted her independence back and <trunc>sh</trunc> he said you know we've just been seeing each other for twenty weeks <pause dur="short"/> I thought <trunc>t</trunc> so you worked out exact pinpoint twenty weeks like not a few months</u>

<u n="229" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="230" who="S0041">wipe clean only <pause dur="short"/> I think all it would all it needs is just the darts</u>
<u n="231" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="232" who="S0041">doing a little but deeper cos they're not very deep at all</u>
<u n="233" who="S0084">no it's quite an easy job there's a woman at the market who does em tailoring</u>
<u n="234" who="S0041">yeah she could perhaps just take them they're not they're really not very much too much big it's literally just the waist band</u>
<u n="235" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="236" who="S0041">they're fine everywhere</u>
<u n="237" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="238" who="S0041">but the waistband they they slip down</u>
<u n="239" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="240" who="S0041">as I walk and I think I think because my legs just aren't fat enough to keep them tight to here so</u>
<u n="241" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="242" who="S0041">they slide down my thighs then my thighs then pull it down from the waist so</u>
<u n="243" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no you <trunc>ju</trunc> you just don't want to feel uncomfortable in them</u>
<u n="244" who="S0041">yeah I don't know I don't know what the best thing to do would be whether perhaps it might be better for her to take them in on the leg rather than the waist <pause dur="short"/> cos the last thing you want is muffin top bulge</u>
<u n="245" who="S0084">well that's not gonna happen cos you're gonna just gonna get smaller <pause dur="short"/> so but it's probably worth doing the leg and waist while she's there</u>
<u n="246" who="S0041">yeah maybe</u>
<u n="247" who="S0084">I mean it's difficult isn't it? Cos you kinda want her to do it not so you can wear them now <pause dur="short"/> but you're just if you're gonna get skinnier again you'll have to do it again</u>
<u n="248" who="S0041">mm</u>

<u n="253" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="254" who="S0041">Cos against skin it tends to to go less</u>
<u n="255" who="S0084">yeah it sticks a bit doesn't it?</u>
<u n="256" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so cos they're they're just quite straight do you see what I mean?</u>

<u n="525" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="526" who="S0084">there's nothing to say that you have to get rid of it <pause dur="short"/> I mean your wardrobe is pretty bare</u>

<u n="535" who="S0041">so I might even be able to wear it</u>

<u n="540" who="S0084">it would be pretty fun</u>
<u n="541" who="S0041">Alice would probably wear something like this <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="542" who="S0084">I think she would wear exactly like that</u>
<u n="543" who="S0041">Alice in Wonderland is my favourite Disney film ever</u>
<u n="544" who="S0084">is it?</u>
<u n="545" who="S0041">yep <pause dur="short"/> I love I love the Mad Hatter's tea party <pause dur="short"/> I played the Mad Hatter once in a play <pause dur="short"/> it was great</u>
<u n="546" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="547" who="S0041">that would be my favourite birthday ever <pause dur="short"/> I was actually going to make it my wedding</u>
<u n="548" who="S0084">we might have to</u>
<u n="549" who="S0041">not just a tea party <unclear/></u>
<u n="550" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> I know a few hens that have done it as a hen <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> in fact actually my friend this week has gone to a Mad Hatter's tea party and she's gone as the mock turtle you know in the story the book</u>
<u n="551" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="552" who="S0084">as opposed to the film they've got mock turtles <pause dur="short"/> and she got some paper plates and painted them green and a couple of years ago we had a Christmas party at work and she was went as Robin Hood <pause dur="short"/> because she bought a beautiful green dress and said right what can I wear it to? Fancy dress party <pause dur="short"/> em then we went in as Robin Hood really foxy Robin Hood so she wear this really sort of slinky green dress and she made a little felt hat and she had like a little toy bow and arrow and she's gonna wear the green dress and just like assemble the paper plates on her front and back</u>
<u n="553" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="554" who="S0084">so she looks like a turtle then obviously when they go so then they go out in the afternoon and have the tea party and she can be the turtle <pause dur="short"/> and then when they go out for dinner she can just pull that off</u>
<u n="555" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="556" who="S0084">and then she's looking hot to trot</u>
<u n="557" who="S0041">ah <pause dur="short"/> that is a good plan</u>
<u n="558" who="S0084">it's quite good <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> quite cheap as well not having to buy costumes all the time</u>
<u n="559" who="S0041">oh yeah</u>
<u n="560" who="S0084">but that hen party cost ninety pounds just for the day and the evening</u>
<u n="561" who="S0041">what are people doing?</u>
<u n="562" who="S0084">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> and then she cos she said it's up in did she say Chester? So the petrol it's going to take her four hours to get there em</u>
<u n="563" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="564" who="S0084">and then and that wasn't even including the dinner</u>
<u n="565" who="S0041">that's a lot of money</u>
<u n="566" who="S0084">or was it including dinner I can't remember <pause dur="short"/> mad <pause dur="short"/> I think I might actually boycott hen parties from now one</u>
<u n="567" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="568" who="S0084">now I've started a precedent now I think I might carry on</u>
<u n="569" who="S0041">that's that is extreme</u>
<u n="570" who="S0084">well I mean I thought Barcelona was pretty bad <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean really you just <pause dur="short"/> I don't wanna have to spend more than thirty forty quid realistically <pause dur="short"/> cos you're gonna go out aren't you and spend money on dinner and drinks <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's the having to travel to places isn't it? That's the problem</u>
<u n="571" who="S0041">you just reminded me of something then <pause dur="short"/> oh Michelle's wedding dress was absolutely beautiful</u>
<u n="572" who="S0084">oh was it?</u>

<u n="623" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="624" who="S0084">but yeah it's not a traditional wedding dress by any means <pause dur="short"/> but I'm quite looking forward to it <pause dur="short"/> well you'll get to see it if you still want to come</u>
<u n="625" who="S0041">yeah I do</u>
<u n="626" who="S0084">we'll have to talk about it on Tuesday when you get paid</u>
<u n="627" who="S0041">yes I do</u>
<u n="628" who="S0084">we'll just sit down and work out logistics really but we could do it together because <pause dur="short"/> she's saying that we have to fly realistically we should fly into Belfast City rather than Belfast International cos it's so much easier to go to the hotel <pause dur="short"/> where we can get changed and then</u>
<u n="629" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="630" who="S0084">find our way to the wedding <pause dur="short"/> but in that case we can't fly from Stanstead and we might have to fly from Gatwick</u>
<u n="631" who="S0041">these match don't they perfectly?</u>
<u n="632" who="S0084">beautifully <pause dur="short"/> but em that's fine cos what we could do is stay with my friend Chrissy in Brixton on the Thursday night and then fly out on the Friday morning from Gatwick</u>
<u n="633" who="S0041">right <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="634" who="S0084">Cos I'm sure she'll be fine with that <pause dur="short"/> she's got space cos we'll just kip on the floor <pause dur="short"/> it'll probably mean getting the tube at some sort of ridiculous hour</u>
<u n="635" who="S0041">stupid o'clock</u>
<u n="636" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="637" who="S0041">my favourite time of the morning <pause dur="short"/> stupid o'clock</u>
<u n="638" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> but it's stupid o'clock from London or stupid o'clock from Cambridge <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="639" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="640" who="S0084">we're probably better off in Brixton</u>
<u n="641" who="S0041">I think that's as far as my packing effort goes I think</u>
<u n="642" who="S0084">it's pretty good <pause dur="short"/> I mean realistically tomorrow morning you have to wash yourself and put your toiletries in a bag</u>
<u n="643" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="644" who="S0084">which is doable <pause dur="short"/> so what bag are you going to take? You can take your swimming bag</u>
<u n="645" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> cos I was gonna take my little <trunc>s</trunc> excuse me suitcase but my little one's going to be a little bit too small</u>
<u n="646" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="647" who="S0041">and that one's going to be to big and that one's just easy to carry</u>
<u n="648" who="S0084">yeah if you don't ram it full of stuff</u>
<u n="649" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's not going to weigh anything</u>
<u n="650" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="651" who="S0041">and I don't want <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to have to carry it</u>
<u n="652" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="653" who="S0041">I really don't know how I feel about this now <pause dur="short"/> now it's come to it</u>
<u n="654" who="S0084">getting nervous</u>
<u n="655" who="S0041">I'm not nervous I just don't especially because of the said situ and moods I'm just I don't want to I don't want to react to something badly</u>
<u n="656" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="657" who="S0041">do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="658" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="659" who="S0041">I don't think I will <pause dur="short"/> but on the phone I felt I felt the same feeling that I'm scared is gonna happen <pause dur="short"/> cos basically he when I was on the phone to him about what we would do em <pause dur="short"/> he and he told me what he was getting for me for my birthday</u>

<u n="687" who="S0041">the shoe bit</u>

<u n="690" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="691" who="S0041">but you know and I'll go in something else and meet you afterwards</u>

<u n="698" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="699" who="S0041">but it was like and he just thought that would be nice cos that you know obviously cos I won't see you on your birthday</u>
<u n="700" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="701" who="S0041">and I said oh right why won't you? </u>
<u n="702" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="703" who="S0041">and he was like em well you know cos I said <pause dur="short"/> Oh no I've got to keep free on the twenty-eighth <pause dur="short"/> The more I think about it I think I might have done that</u>
<u n="704" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="705" who="S0041">I think I think I said keep free</u>
<u n="706" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="707" who="S0041">for the weekend before and the weekend after <pause dur="short"/> cos I remember saying to him that what about going to Nottingham</u>
<u n="708" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="709" who="S0041">and I said if we do that it'll prob it'll be a girls'</u>
<u n="710" who="S0084">weekend</u>
<u n="711" who="S0041">holiday <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> em but you know keep one or the other free cos whichever one we don't go for <pause dur="short"/> I'll we'll do something together <pause dur="short"/> so actually out of all my nitpicking of that I think I might have actually the person that said keep free</u>
<u n="712" who="S0084">but then he hasn't written it on the calendar <pause dur="short"/> he hasn't written like keep free <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> says keep free <pause dur="short"/> so now he has no idea why he's keeping it free</u>
<u n="713" who="S0041">yeah and he's not asked <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> which is ridiculous</u>
<u n="714" who="S0084">he's still not asked her?</u>
<u n="715" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="716" who="S0084">that's a bit weird</u>
<u n="717" who="S0041">yeah I don't really understand what's going on with them like <pause dur="short"/> I don't know but anyway he said you know cos I've said I've got on the calendar keep free and you said it's not you so</u>
<u n="718" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="719" who="S0041">I don't know I just <pause dur="short"/> am I being stupid cos I kind of thought <pause dur="short"/> I thought to myself <pause dur="short"/> like I had a real sinking feeling cos I kind of thought <pause dur="short"/> even if Even if it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that asked you to keep it free <pause dur="short"/> I can't believe that you would keep both those weekends as weekends for her <pause dur="short"/> that are both around my birthday and not think to say like <pause dur="short"/> Actually it's <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> birthday that week <pause dur="short"/> she she might want me to do something at at one of those so <pause dur="short"/> can we just have one that's a keep free? Do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="720" who="S0084">yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> well to be <trunc>ho</trunc> he might have done <pause dur="short"/> he might have thought that and now he just can't remember <pause dur="short"/> I think he might have done it a while ago if it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that actually was the one who said keep it free <pause dur="short"/> cos it could well be that it was you <pause dur="short"/> and it actually there's no need to get too worried about it cos it was you in in the first place</u>
<u n="721" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="722" who="S0084">but yeah I mean if if he did if he's just completely blocked out the rest of the next nine months to see <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> bearing in mind that you'll probably be gone within nine months it's a bit of a kicker</u>
<u n="723" who="S0041">innit?</u>
<u n="724" who="S0084">but then it's all supposed to be that way isn't it? Like typically you don't stay this close with your ex-boyfriend or girlfriends <pause dur="short"/> so you don't say</u>
<u n="725" who="S0041">yeah but it's birthday time</u>
<u n="726" who="S0084">yeah but then if you're seeing somebody else like you you don't know what you might be doing in April like you might be seeing somebody he might be more serious with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like <pause dur="short"/> you might have a a you know a group of people out that night say if we went on a girlie thing and he would definitely come and you and he would definitely be invited and you definitely would see each other but <pause dur="short"/> like to actually just spend time just one on one <pause dur="short"/> cos I've got nothing to compare it to so to me it seems a bit <pause dur="short"/> a little but strange but maybe it's not maybe it's completely normal just like it would be normal if you were all like best mates and you had never actually been in a relationship together</u>
<u n="727" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="728" who="S0084">like if you were just best mates maybe you would just hang out just the two of you but <pause dur="short"/> given that you've got history <pause dur="short"/> for anybody new that's coming in it's hard like it would be hard to break in to that relationship that you have <pause dur="short"/> the two of you <pause dur="short"/> like whatever it is now</u>
<u n="729" who="S0041">yeah whatever it is</u>
<u n="730" who="S0084">whatever is going on it's hard for anybody new <pause dur="short"/> I'm obviously not that my sympathies lie with her at all but <pause dur="short"/> and I don't think he's handling the situation at all well <pause dur="short"/> but you know this is the first time both of you have done this so you are gonna sort of <pause dur="short"/> it is a bit of a learning curve</u>
<u n="731" who="S0041">and he said em <pause dur="short"/> and you know <trunc>na</trunc> you know I haven't been invited to anything so <pause dur="short"/> and then he tried to have a dig at me as it was my fault</u>
<u n="732" who="S0084">Good job you said it was a girlie thing</u>
<u n="733" who="S0041">yeah and that we'd do something else <pause dur="short"/> I don't know I just thought it was really weird really odd</u>
<u n="734" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> he is a bit of a strange one isn't he?</u>
<u n="735" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I you know that awful kind of sinking feeling <pause dur="short"/> I don't I really don't want anything else to come up this weekend that gives me that kind of <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="736" who="S0084">it hurts</u>
<u n="737" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos I don't want to <trunc>re</trunc> I don't want to react <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="738" who="S0084">mm mm mm <pause dur="short"/> well yeah</u>
<u n="739" who="S0041">I just want it to go smoothly without a hitch and then</u>
<u n="740" who="S0084">walk away</u>
<u n="741" who="S0041">have some nice photographs <pause dur="short"/> it'll be a nice memory <pause dur="short"/> and then if if actually that's it then</u>
<u n="742" who="S0084">well I don't you know I don't think it needs to be it <pause dur="short"/> you just need to you know at the end of this weekend just give yourself some space <pause dur="short"/> and that's what you'd already you've already laid that groundwork with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you've already said that's what you need <pause dur="short"/> so it shouldn't come as a shock to him</u>
<u n="743" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="744" who="S0084">so yeah all being well you know you'll have a nice time and then you'll just come back and <pause dur="short"/> it'll be as it is this week you know <pause dur="short"/> not actually seeing each other all the time and try and keep a bit of distance</u>
<u n="745" who="S0041">yeah but before said space I want to leave <pause dur="short"/> I don't want to leave with a nasty taste do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="746" who="S0084">mm yeah of course</u>
<u n="747" who="S0041">so</u>
<u n="748" who="S0084">well this is what we were saying though like <pause dur="short"/> if something does come up it's gonna really hurt and it's gonna make you feel sick <pause dur="short"/> and you're not going to enjoy it</u>
<u n="749" who="S0041">yeah I know</u>
<u n="750" who="S0084">but you went it to this with your eyes open didn't you like <pause dur="short"/> I remember you saying like you wanted to do this because you feel like it's going to help you move on <pause dur="short"/> like it is going to be make or break like it's</u>
<u n="751" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="752" who="S0084">if something does come up you can't <pause dur="short"/> depending on what it is it's gonna be hard to react hard not to react cos you can't really <pause dur="short"/> cos if he's like of whatever if he says something about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and it it hurts <pause dur="short"/> he's sort of within his rights to talk about her</u>
<u n="753" who="S0041">no he's no</u>
<u n="754" who="S0084">I know it's hard <pause dur="short"/> cos your you know it'll be a really nice time and you'll just fall back into the routine of <trunc>ju</trunc> it just being the two of you really easy</u>
<u n="755" who="S0041">ah</u>
<u n="756" who="S0084">but you'll have a nice time you know</u>

<u n="781" who="S0041">yeah I think it's going to be a bit of a whistle-stop tour</u>
<u n="782" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="783" who="S0041">which is good</u>
<u n="784" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> knackering but but good</u>
<u n="785" who="S0041">yeah I don't I don't want to get too too knackered like I'm thinking <pause dur="short"/> perhaps go to the market tomorrow then go back to the hotel and have a bit of a kip</u>
<u n="786" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="787" who="S0041">you know a bit of a just a rest a breather</u>

<u n="790" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="793" who="S0041">not let's do all this and run around cos I can't be arsed with that shit</u>
<u n="794" who="S0084">what it's just very knackering and I don't think you actually see anything in any great detail you know if you wanted to go the Tate Modern you should just take half a day or a whole day</u>
<u n="795" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="796" who="S0084">then do it <pause dur="short"/> and then the next time you go to London do something else cos otherwise it's not <pause dur="short"/> sort of pointless really</u>
<u n="797" who="S0041">that's what I thought</u>
<u n="798" who="S0084">it's a pretty a pretty impressive place</u>
<u n="799" who="S0041">is it?</u>
<u n="800" who="S0084">the Tate Modern yeah yeah cos there's an old turbine hall so it's massive</u>
<u n="801" who="S0041">is it?</u>
<u n="802" who="S0084">it's really massive yeah <pause dur="short"/> I've forgotten the last one I went to see I can never remember his name <pause dur="short"/> it was a Chinese artist who was imprisoned for like forty years for speaking out again the Chinese regime</u>
<u n="803" who="S0041">oh yeah</u>
<u n="804" who="S0084">and he's supposed to be like on the run now <pause dur="short"/> em what is his name? Pass <pause dur="short"/> and he had tiny grains of sand and each one of them was hand painted in the turbine hall <pause dur="short"/> when you see the turbine hall you'll see how big it is and it each grain of sand was painted by Chinese workers <pause dur="short"/> and but they're painted like with lead and so health and safety came and took them all away because they said oh it's you know because people were going in and walking on them <pause dur="short"/> so it's like walking on like westerners walking on the work of what people do in the east <pause dur="short"/> so how much time and effort goes into work that they produce and <pause dur="short"/> yeah it was quite it was quite a statement and but they took it all away and they said you couldn't go in</u>
<u n="805" who="S0041">there was sand all over the floor?</u>
<u n="806" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and you</u>
<u n="807" who="S0041">and this a massive hall?</u>
<u n="808" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> was it sand or was it rice? It might have been rice grains of rice <pause dur="short"/> but even still it's pretty fucking small and it's all over the turbine hall you know <pause dur="short"/> it was amazing</u>
<u n="809" who="S0041">wow</u>
<u n="810" who="S0084">yeah and you could go walk on it and then they said you couldn't walk on it and then they just took it all away <pause dur="short"/> it's really sad</u>
<u n="811" who="S0041">motherfuckers <pause dur="short"/> there's a photography exhibit on there at the minute <pause dur="short"/> I don't really know cos I'm really not an art person at all <pause dur="short"/> I like it I enjoy it like I appreciate it but I just have no knowledge of at all</u>
<u n="812" who="S0084">yeah no well I'm the same particularly like modern art <pause dur="short"/> I think it's all a bit em a bit silly</u>
<u n="813" who="S0041">yeah em</u>
<u n="814" who="S0084">I'd rather go and watch a play watch a movie read a book</u>
<u n="815" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="816" who="S0084">I don't really understand art <pause dur="short"/> unless I can the talent in it and you can't it's difficult to quantify modern art isn't it? It's difficult to for people to say that's good that's bad</u>
<u n="817" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="818" who="S0084">unmade bed <pause dur="short"/> pile of brick</u>

<u n="826" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="844" who="S0084">it's look nice from the outside</u>
<u n="845" who="S0041">I went there once and we just had like a sandwich cos it was lunch time</u>
<u n="846" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="847" who="S0041">but it wasn't much to write home about <pause dur="short"/> maybe we ordered the wrong stuff</u>
<u n="848" who="S0084">is that the one on the corner on <anon type="place"/> Street?</u>
<u n="849" who="S0041">it's the one it's</u>
<u n="850" who="S0084">Cos they're a few that opened</u>
<u n="851" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="852" who="S0084">the last couple of years and there's one that's on the corner that looks quite nice</u>
<u n="853" who="S0041">I don't know</u>
<u n="854" who="S0084">Cos it used to be an American diner and you used to sit in like old nineteen fifties cars when we first moved to Cambridge about four or five years ago <pause dur="short"/> it's a proper American diner and I really <trunc>lik</trunc> I though it but cheesy as hell</u>
<u n="855" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="856" who="S0084">but it was quite fun and obviously like playing Elvis records all the time but I think it was an independent and it just closed down and then yeah</u>
<u n="857" who="S0041">I can't remember if it's the corner one</u>
<u n="858" who="S0084">but like a brasserie type place opened up and it was on the corner but I never I never looked that closely</u>
<u n="859" who="S0041">there's a couple in a row <pause dur="short"/> there's two or three</u>
<u n="860" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> there's two</u>
<u n="861" who="S0041">they blur into one</u>
<u n="862" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="863" who="S0041">Cos they <trunc>brou</trunc> they're both red</u>
<u n="864" who="S0084">Cos then cos you've got Chez Gerard and you've got CafÃ© Rouge then you've got a couple more</u>
<u n="865" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="866" who="S0084">and there that sort of stretch of restaurants</u>
<u n="867" who="S0041">so I was a bit like oh</u>
<u n="868" who="S0084">so it's not something special then?</u>
<u n="869" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> well I don't think so <pause dur="short"/> he might cos he's never been there before</u>
<u n="870" who="S0084">I mean it's difficult isn't it? Somewhere like London where you've got so much choice <pause dur="short"/> it's really hard <pause dur="short"/> so at least you know like if you do book at chain but like a good chain at least you know what you're getting</u>
<u n="871" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="872" who="S0084">maybe he knows that the dinners there are quite nice</u>
<u n="873" who="S0041">God knows <pause dur="short"/> and then I thought well the dinner in the hotel should be fantastic</u>
<u n="874" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="875" who="S0041">but then it seems a shame to go to London and eat in the hotel</u>
<u n="876" who="S0084">yeah really <pause dur="short"/> a bit of a waste</u>
<u n="877" who="S0041">so even though we do only pay fifty percent for it so the food is just like it's basically Ã¡ la carte dining for next to nothing</u>
<u n="878" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="879" who="S0041">for two people two courses you're looking at a hundred and twenty quid</u>
<u n="880" who="S0084">wow</u>
<u n="881" who="S0041">we pay sixty</u>
<u n="882" who="S0084">that's really good</u>
<u n="883" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="884" who="S0084">really good</u>
<u n="885" who="S0041">you kind of should do it for the just to be able to but it's there's no point</u>
<u n="886" who="S0084">mm hmm</u>
<u n="887" who="S0041">there's no point in going down to London if you're just going to stay in the hotel <pause dur="short"/> and we get canapÃ©s and champagne before we leave anyway so</u>
<u n="888" who="S0084">that's pretty sweet</u>
<u n="889" who="S0041">that's a winner</u>
<u n="890" who="S0084">and you get half the price on the bar as well don't you?</u>
<u n="891" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cocktails may be required</u>
<u n="892" who="S0084">cheeky cocktail</u>
<u n="893" who="S0041">I think cheeky vino may be required</u>
<u n="894" who="S0084">I don't know if I don't <trunc>mi</trunc> don't mind if I do</u>
<u n="895" who="S0041">em</u>

<u n="905" who="S0041">eh who's he? Who is he?</u>
<u n="906" who="S0084">eh his name's <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> he is a roofer but he also writes screenplays <pause dur="short"/> naturally the two thing go together</u>
<u n="907" who="S0041">go</u>
<u n="908" who="S0084">go?</u>
<u n="909" who="S0041">he might act</u>
<u n="910" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/> We need to start writing these <trunc>thi</trunc> these don't we? So if we've got one that sings one that acts the next one is what dancing?</u>
<u n="911" who="S0041">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="912" who="S0084">mime possibly <pause dur="short"/> that would be quite good</u>
<u n="913" who="S0041">well that would be the winner if someone mimed</u>
<u n="914" who="S0084">or and then then drawing <pause dur="short"/> maybe some sort of eh graffiti or stroke</u>
<u n="915" who="S0041">or</u>
<u n="916" who="S0084">caricature artist</u>
<u n="917" who="S0041">yeah pull out paper and just</u>
<u n="918" who="S0084">mm I don't they freak me out those things but yes</u>

<u n="927" who="S0041">I think I just felt I just thought I felt a bit sick then that's probably why</u>
<u n="928" who="S0084">you haven't eaten all day you absolute maniac no wonder if you're hungry <pause dur="short"/> I haven't stopped eating today <pause dur="short"/> I've eaten so much <pause dur="short"/> I've had porridge for breakfast then I had some <unclear/> for midmorning snack <pause dur="short"/> then I had an omelette the most successful omelette I've ever made in my life <pause dur="short"/> not out of a frying pan not that I'm harping on about my frying pan <pause dur="short"/> em my my frying pan that's in heaven <pause dur="short"/> and then in the afternoon I went into town and then I came back and I made fajitas that actually weren't fajitas at all it was just some corn in a wrap that wasn't even fajita mix because I didn't have any so I just put loads of spices on it <pause dur="short"/> em random spices with salad</u>
<u n="929" who="S0041">Good</u>
<u n="930" who="S0084">so just some sort of wrap really not a fajita in any sense shape or form</u>

<u n="937" who="S0041">I feel like I <pause dur="short"/> well I need to make my soup but I just keep putting it off cos I can't be arsed but now</u>
<u n="938" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="939" who="S0041">everything there's gonna go off if I don't use it</u>
<u n="940" who="S0084">get it in <pause dur="short"/> put it all in <pause dur="short"/> no cos the last time you did that you made the inedible you make the inedible soup</u>

<u n="942" who="S0084">Don't do that</u>
<u n="943" who="S0041">no it's just minestrone again I just can't be able to make it <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> Maybe I'll feel more inclined to do it in the morning</u>
<u n="944" who="S0084">it seems unlikely given that you've only got an hour to get ready <pause dur="short"/> you should get up like in an hour's time</u>
<u n="945" who="S0041">oh dear</u>
<u n="946" who="S0084">em did the house smell when you came home?</u>
<u n="947" who="S0041">eh I wasn't smelling I wasn't prepared to smell</u>
<u n="948" who="S0084">but I think if it had smelt you would have smelled it</u>
<u n="949" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> I've got a really bad sense of smell</u>
<u n="950" who="S0084">oh have you?</u>

<u n="952" who="S0084">you've got to be aware of smelling have you?</u>

<u n="954" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="955" who="S0041">em basically if I I think I don't know how I worked this out but I think I only have a sense of smell up one nostril</u>
<u n="956" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="957" who="S0041">so like I'm a bit snotty today</u>
<u n="958" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="964" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="965" who="S0041">it's so weird isn't it?</u>
<u n="966" who="S0084">well I suppose it's like my not thinking that I could possibly be allergic to apples until you said that your face gets hot and tingly and hot and red when you eat chocolate and you think that's probably because you're allergic to it <pause dur="short"/> that's always happened to me when I eat apples <pause dur="short"/> any type of apple my face goes really hot <pause dur="short"/> I sweat loads and it tingles and I just thought oh that's a bit weird <pause dur="short"/> why is it that apples do that to you? Oh well and carried on</u>
<u n="967" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="968" who="S0084">never flagged it as an issue and now I think god</u>
<u n="969" who="S0041">I just <pause dur="short"/> I can't really smell</u>
<u n="970" who="S0084">well I can't smell at the moment because of the cold but</u>

<u n="975" who="S0041">it's I don't know</u>
<u n="976" who="S0084">than everyone else's maybe? It's just not hyper-sensitive</u>
<u n="977" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but the other day when I came back I could smell it so</u>
<u n="978" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="979" who="S0041">if I'm clear if I'm nasally clear <pause dur="short"/> I think it might be cos I've got quite bad sinuses</u>
<u n="980" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="981" who="S0041">like <pause dur="short"/> I've <pause dur="short"/> what's the thing I've got?</u>
<u n="982" who="S0084">sinusitis</u>
<u n="983" who="S0041">rhinoitis</u>

<u n="989" who="S0041">it's em <pause dur="short"/> yes it's just the sinus <pause dur="short"/> basically I'm allergic to dust air con changes in temperature like everything <pause dur="short"/> it's just stupid</u>
<u n="990" who="S0084">that's madness</u>
<u n="991" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it just makes me snotty <pause dur="short"/> it's a bit like hay fever</u>
<u n="992" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="993" who="S0041">A bit like hay fever <pause dur="short"/> but I haven't had it very bad for years and years</u>
<u n="994" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="995" who="S0041">so I just assumed it's gone away but I think the non smell thing</u>
<u n="996" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="997" who="S0041">is probably part of that which is a bit weird</u>
<u n="998" who="S0084">it is a bit weird isn't it?</u>
<u n="999" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> can you smell it? Have you smelt it?</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0084">I smelt it the other day one day <pause dur="short"/> and I opened the window and then everyone smelt the fridges and I took the bin out today and I threw away some chicken and I hoovered actually</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0041">I put loads of bleach down the drain <pause dur="short"/> I think it was the drain <pause dur="short"/> I think it was when I eh emptied out the soup the mouldy soup</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0041">I think it was something stuck in the drain</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0084">possibly cos it doesn't <pause dur="short"/> I don't really can't really smell it <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said when he went out this morning and came here he could smell like that it was like smelly in the house but like when I came back from town earlier I couldn't smell anything</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0041">did you get anything from town</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0084">eh just some birthday cards and oh <vocal desc="yawn"/> excuse me and some stuff from Boots <pause dur="short"/> nothing exciting</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0084">I did <pause dur="short"/> I get emails from InStyle magazine and em they send one to me every day and yesterday they had feature that was fifty dresses for under fifty quid <pause dur="short"/> they had this T-shirt dress from River Island I thought it was <pause dur="short"/> I'm never sure about River Island cos I think it's like almost chavy and</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0041">right</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0084">it's quite young</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0041">it's got a lot better recently</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0084">we'll it always used to be okay and then it got quite chav and now I think it might be it's like borderline <pause dur="short"/> there's some stuff that you can get away with</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's quite</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0084">but it's also quite young <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="1015" who="S0041">yeah it's very young and I think now it's really overpriced <pause dur="short"/> it never used to be <pause dur="short"/> river Island</u>
<u n="1016" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0041">used to be less expensive than Topshop</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0041">and now they're on pretty an even par but there's not the same design or the same quality</u>
<u n="1020" who="S0084">yeah I think and the yeah the quality of the material is just not there <pause dur="short"/> but it was em like a long T-shirt dress like round neck like crew neck or whatever they call it <pause dur="short"/> em black and white pattern like A sort of paisley pattern it's a bit weird and like a brighter trim around the bottom like bright like orange and blue floral pattern at the bottom</u>
<u n="1021" who="S0041">ah</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0084">so it was quite interesting and it looked like sort of gold finishing on the sleeve and I could see it online and it was twenty quid so I thought that would be quite good I'd wear it with leggings and heels maybe if I go out or just slobbing around or whatever <pause dur="short"/> it's quite quite good for twenty quid <pause dur="short"/> and I went in to have a look at it and the the what do you call it? Like lamy? Lamy? like gold just like a really cheap synthetic material like</u>
<u n="1023" who="S0041">like that skirt?</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0084">it's not cotton <pause dur="short"/> no your skirt's nice whatever your skirt is <pause dur="short"/> it's really cheap <pause dur="short"/> it's almost like that but like thicker if you can imagine it?</u>
<u n="1025" who="S0041">like thick satin or?</u>
<u n="1026" who="S0084">yeah but just really cheap <pause dur="short"/> really cheap</u>
<u n="1027" who="S0041">ah</u>
<u n="1028" who="S0084">and so it sticks out and just looks really weird and like the I quite like the the clash of the monochrome and the floral coloured pattern at the bottom <pause dur="short"/> and it might be that you could get away with the sleeves you know if you just teamed it with some nice big gold earrings or something fake or the real gold whatever <pause dur="short"/> but I didn't try it on because I don't wanna or no I could I couldn't really justify buying any clothes I said I wasn't going to buy any clothes for a while so <pause dur="short"/> and I don't really need it so I just thought if it's really nice for twenty quid and I'll get it but I was a bit like hmm might be nice I if try it on <pause dur="short"/> can I be arsed? It's <unclear/> me</u>
<u n="1029" who="S0041">ah <pause dur="short"/> lost all love</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0084">and everyone was just stopping in my way and I wanted to punch everybody in the head</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0041">Saturday's in town are just the worst</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0084">yeah I every weekend you know every time I go in on a Saturday I think why do I do this to myself? </u>
<u n="1033" who="S0041">no bad</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0084">if I go <pause dur="short"/> I normally try to go for nine AM and I'm home by ten thirty and it's</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0041">that's fine</u>

<u n="1043" who="S0041">em to take for the weekend which I thought would be nice</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0041">I mean the more I think about it I think in actual fact what's what's really happening here is <pause dur="short"/> that without cos I've subconsciously put quite a lot of effort into this weekend</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah you have</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0041">and I really don't think whatever the outcome is I'm going to be satisfied with it really</u>
<u n="1048" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1049" who="S0041">so I think I probably need to prepare for that a bit</u>
<u n="1050" who="S0084">well I think realistically at this point you want him to just turn around and say I love you let's get back together </u>
<u n="1051" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="1052" who="S0084">because</u>
<u n="1053" who="S0041">but it's not going to work that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what's going on in my head is if he said that to me I'd be really happy but I'd also be thinking no because</u>
<u n="1054" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0041">that the way you're behaving</u>
<u n="1056" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1057" who="S0041">is not a person that I want in my want to be with</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0084">well absolutely yeah <pause dur="short"/> he can't he's a completely different person it seems from how he was when he was with you</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0084">and also you know the fact that he would jack in something with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that quickly like obviously he's saying that she doesn't mean anything to him but you know it's a worry with people that do that like he is very much in sort of two minds it seems the more you've got somebody like that you just can't really trust him</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so I don't know why I think it I don't know why</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0084">but</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0041">I don't know why I think it</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0084">yeah I think you have to prepare yourself that really there's a good chance that something's going to happen this week that's going to hurt</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0084">you know yeah</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0084">Cos worst you know the best <trunc>t</trunc> <trunc>s</trunc> yeah the best outcome is you have a really nice weekend</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> the best outcome is we have a lovely weekend <pause dur="short"/> do you know that I just want him to realise</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0084">but that's still going to hurt though <pause dur="short"/> you know like you know you come back whenever it is Monday and you say your goodbyes and you think well that was a really nice weekend and then that's gonna hurt because then you've got to walk away <pause dur="short"/> and you know</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0084">if you have anything less than a good weekend that's gonna hurt for whatever reason makes it a not good weekend</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's a lose lose situation</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0084">yeah which is what I've been saying for weeks</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0041">yes I know</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but that said I can I understand why you're doing it <pause dur="short"/> and maybe this is a way of re-establishing your friendship rather than whatever weird thing is going on between you two at the moment</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0084">so</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0041">I <pause dur="short"/> I just feel a bit I said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> the thing is I just don't feel like he's <pause dur="short"/> after all the things he was saying about how special what we had was I just don't think I feel like he's treating it like it was</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0041">because he's not behaving well towards me so I kinda think that that just tarnishes</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0041">tarnishes what we had and I don't think he's really <pause dur="short"/> <event desc="sound of phone"/> Hello?</u>

<u n="1085" who="S0041">and like the when we're going away like Navyness and whatever I kinda think like he doesn't care that he's not going to see me</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> well I mean he probably does he just hasn't it's like isn't any comprehension he just doesn't see</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0084">long term <pause dur="short"/> like he's just I think he thinks that it's just a pipe dream on a pipe dream that's wrong though</u>

<u n="1090" who="S0084">it's just you know that your plan for today</u>

<u n="1102" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> which is why I will not be throwing myself out of any planes <pause dur="short"/> I mean I would quite like to go to on a hot air balloon but I think I would have to sit down in the basket <pause dur="short"/> cos I think</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0041">but then you wouldn't get to see very much</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0084">oh no cos I'm quite tall <pause dur="short"/> I'm quite long in the torso if you think the basket is probably here</u>

And I said well I <trunc>w</trunc> I wouldn't dare Michael I wouldn't dare but it is quite early in the morning I just wonder whether you accidentally slipped on the button for sausage and pressed it ten times rather than two times because that's a bit obscene <pause dur="short"/> Em and I said if you're gonna recalculate it as more I wanna just have that price please <pause dur="short"/> eh and he did it again and it came out at two pounds and I was like right <pause dur="short"/> so how did we get the three pounds twenty-four? and he was like yeah I <trunc>n</trunc> I'm so sorry about that <pause dur="short"/> such a piss take if he didn't I think he does it on purpose because obviously he's the manager so he just overcharges everybody</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0041">yeah</u>

<u n="1194" who="S0041">chicken crumble?</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0084">yeah so it was crumble but with like a like imagine like a chicken pie <pause dur="short"/> so chicken and bacon and mushrooms in a you know</u>

<u n="1199" who="S0084">and then you'd have a pie on top or around it <pause dur="short"/> well without the pie instead of the pie you've got crumble so it was mental but pretty nice <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't a sweet crumble it was a savoury crumble but it was <trunc>goo</trunc></u>
<u n="1200" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> like a crust</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0084">it was good <pause dur="short"/> yeah it was really nice with like some tatties and eh like carrot and swede mash or something <pause dur="short"/> and he was oh yeah that's two pounds <trunc>no</trunc> and I know knew for one it should be like three ninety-nine <pause dur="short"/> and I was like oh that's really great and he was like oh I didn't see your veg on your way out <pause dur="short"/> thanks <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> it's so bad like obviously the feminist in me is like oh you should you know shouldn't allow it you shouldn't allow it  <pause dur="short"/> and then I'm like well I'm fucking poor </u>

<u n="1205" who="S0084">be ignored <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's pretty good <pause dur="short"/> that's who you want on the till <pause dur="short"/> I mean I it's already pretty subsidised so even like the the the full meal is yeah is like four quid so it's not it's not going to break the bank <pause dur="short"/> but it does make you really frugal like to think the difference between two like two fifty or four pounds</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0041">that's a big difference isn't it?</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0084">it is a big difference like you can have a bowl soup <pause dur="short"/> a small bowl of soup is forty P or a big bowl of is ninety P I think? So even that's really cheap</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0084">like a small bowl of soup there's not actually that much difference in quantity</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0084">but it's its price so you might as well get a small bowl <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0041">they say that at work <pause dur="short"/> they say you know we <trunc>sh</trunc> we can't really complain about the quality of the food that they serve because it's free</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0041">but</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0084">did you not get the food they serve to the guests?</u>

<u n="1217" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0041">oh no</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0084">who cooks your food then? Have they got a special company in do they?</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> it's the chefs but em</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0084">it's the same chefs then?</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it's just like cos obviously the stuff that's served in the restaurants is the restaurant's open in the evening and it's a la carte</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0041">so it's like monkfish and duck and</u>

<u n="1226" who="S0041">other shit</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0041">and the lunch bar it's like well burgers or pizza are fine <pause dur="short"/> but they couldn't afford to give us that cos I think they're allocated something stupid like forty P a head?</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0084">for their staff?</u>

<u n="1270" who="S0041">yeah I know this is absolute cack although I must admit because of all the complaining I've been doing <pause dur="short"/> eh it has got better for the past couple of weeks</u>

<u n="1283" who="S0084">oh so what does that mean? Like finding a charity to sponsor or doing campaigns to raise money?</u>

<u n="1293" who="S0084">it's everything it's Africa <pause dur="short"/> eh is it everything or is it Africa?</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0041">it's it's <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>w</trunc> what's that really big charity?</u>

<u n="1299" who="S0084">cancer Research?</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0084">RSPCA? RNIB?</u>
<u n="1302" who="S0041">it helps</u>
<u n="1303" who="S0084">RNLI</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0041">it helps loads of <trunc>peo</trunc> loads of different things</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0084">UN no not UN? Oh</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0041">oh I can't fucking remember <pause dur="short"/> but I should know this being on charity border calls</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0084"><trunc>Prob</trunc> probs yeah</u>
<u n="1308" who="S0041">but yeah anyway it doesn't do that like last year <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>whi</trunc> they sponsored Whizz Kids right</u>
<u n="1309" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0041">which is basically the charity of the children with chairs <pause dur="short"/> and I think we I think we bought two our hotel bought two and they were six pound a go</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0084">wow</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0041">because people could really relate to it so when you're doing things you knew you could quantify what you're giving to somebody <pause dur="short"/> you know how much that would change their way of life</u>
<u n="1313" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1314" who="S0041">so people really got into it</u>
<u n="1315" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0041">but now it's like well what does the charity do? I don't really know <pause dur="short"/> you know it's in Africa and if there's a natural disaster or any type of disaster war or something they provide shelter for people who lose their homes</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0041">which is the part that I've we're supposedly going in as shelter in a storm</u>
<u n="1319" who="S0084">mm well that's good</u>
<u n="1320" who="S0041">but then</u>
<u n="1321" who="S0084">that's what they need</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0041">well yeah but <trunc>th</trunc> the logic being that we provide luxury accommodation for people</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0041">all over the world</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0041">these people provide accommodation no matter what</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0041">all the time like that's just as <trunc>in</trunc> just as luxurious to somebody with nothing</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0041">it <pause dur="short"/> I think that's supposed to be the the kind of link</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0084">tenuous link <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but this other <trunc>char</trunc> because it does so much stuff <pause dur="short"/> it helps fight AIDS in Africa <pause dur="short"/> it's malaria jabs it's children in India they're getting married off at eight years old and raped</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0084">is it Amnesty International?</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> frig <pause dur="short"/> it's it's like it's really like Amnesty International but and I think it's called Community community oh</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0084">world is it like The World Aid Organisation or World or something? Mate you probably should know this</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0041">I know <pause dur="short"/> but it's like that and you know you just think well <trunc>y</trunc> you no you can't quantify do they want do they want us to give clothes? Do they want us to give money? Do what? I just it just doesn't make sense</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0084">the thing is they've probably have you this and you've probably gone yeah it's interesting</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0041">no they haven't actually</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0084">have they not?</u>
<u n="1340" who="S0041">I don't know if they've told the management team but they certainly haven't told us yet</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0084">because that's well that's what you need to know isn't it? Otherwise there's no point</u>
<u n="1342" who="S0041" trans="overlap">there's no direction <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's what I said</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1344" who="S0041">so it just it just seems a waste of time <pause dur="short"/> but yeah check that on the CV board board for charity borders</u>
<u n="1345" who="S0084"><trunc>Lit</trunc> literally bored to tears</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0041">yes to death <pause dur="short"/> and the worst part is we have to send someone from the department and obviously no one volunteered to go but I can't do charity stuff <pause dur="short"/> like I really can't</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0084">what? Why?</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0041">have I told you that? I think Africa is just like I can't even don't even know what's going on there</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0084">what <unclear/></u>
<u n="1350" who="S0041">I have told you this before <pause dur="short"/> this makes me sound really mean but you know starving kids in Africa?</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0041">I can't really accept that that's real and I know it is but because I've just I find it so horrific</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0041">I've just <pause dur="short"/> I I it's just so far away from anything l I can possibly understand <pause dur="short"/> it I feel like when I see it on TV it's not real</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0041">which makes me sound awful</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1358" who="S0041">and I know it does but it's just it's so it's so bad <pause dur="short"/> I just can't understand how I just can't I just can't fathom it</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0041">it's like space you know I just I</u>
<u n="1361" who="S0084">well I mean it's horrific and it is difficult to understand that in this day and age you know in Somalia kids are dying every day</u>
<u n="1362" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0084">hundreds and thousands of people are dying every day and yet there's absolutely no need for it <pause dur="short"/> every day like what is it every three seconds somebody dies in Africa <trunc>beca</trunc></u>
<u n="1364" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0084">you know needlessly through lack of water through drinking dirty water through lack of immunization you know it's it's happening all the time at at a time when we've cured all of these diseases</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0084">but we let it run wild out there because it's just not financially viable for us to do anything about it <pause dur="short"/> it is disgusting and it is really far away but the worry is obviously what with television being everywhere in our lives is we are desensitized to everything</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0084">so if we see something we're like oh that's just the TV I'll just block that out <pause dur="short"/> but they but that's so much more important it's like when people are like oh we've got to help ourselves before we help anybody else and you think well that's not really what it's all about it's about helping the people who need it the most </u>
<u n="1370" who="S0041">but do you not think and this is this makes me sound like Hitler</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0041">which I know that <pause dur="short"/> so do you know prepare yourself <pause dur="short"/> but do you not think that <pause dur="short"/> like if these if we these people should be able to should <trunc>wa</trunc> they're just not evolved <pause dur="short"/> do you not think? Like the only reason they're they're genetically different to us because okay so they're not educated cos we were given an education</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0041">but we weren't educated we were cavemen too</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0041">and it's just because our environment is habitable that we've been able to evolve and learn these things like <pause dur="short"/> I I <trunc>ca</trunc> I find it really weird it's like aliens to me <pause dur="short"/> honestly it's like aliens to me <pause dur="short"/> like they live in an environment that can't really readily or easily for the for the vast part of it anyway their land can't grow things</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0041">it's not it's not <trunc>cru</trunc> it's not supposed to sustain life</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's not It's not yeah it's not sustainable yeah</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0041">it's not supposed to so no matter how much <trunc>m</trunc> money you throw at the problem</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0041"><trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> it's perpetual because they shouldn't be living there</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1384" who="S0041">and really I can't I can't help but think right that if maybe if maybe no one was throwing money at it</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0041"><trunc>w</trunc> which is where the Hitler comes in they would all be dead</u>
<u n="1387" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0041">anyway <pause dur="short"/> which isn't that I wish all the people dead</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0041">I just wish that maybe thousands of years ago hundreds of years ago when people started throwing money at the problem they didn't throw money at it so it never developed <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean like I</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0084">I <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>w</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="1392" who="S0041">I can't understand how it got to this now</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0084">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I mean my history is pretty bad as well <pause dur="short"/> I don't know why <pause dur="short"/> obviously we all come from Africa <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>even</trunc> like</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0084">through the last thousands of years as man's evolved we've all come from Africa <pause dur="short"/> so <trunc>every</trunc> we are from them</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0084">so why it happened that you know obviously in the west we evolved more quickly we maybe it was because our terrain was much more habitable and we were able to do that <pause dur="short"/> as as we evolved we then went to these countries and then enslaved them and we took religion and we took our culture and enforced it on these countries <pause dur="short"/> so like for example when you go to New Zealand and you learn about the Maori culture and you learn about how they'd had to come over from you know Polynesian Islands and they and and you know <trunc>in</trunc> invaded New Zealand and the Maoris had made it their own land <pause dur="short"/> and when the whites came like the missionaries came they came and taught them religion <pause dur="short"/> so they taught them that God had created the earth in seven days and on the seventh day he rested and the seventh day was a sacred day <pause dur="short"/> so they laid down their weapons on the seventh day and they rested and the white man came and they brutally murdered them all <pause dur="short"/> because they knew that they'd lay down their weapons</u>
<u n="1398" who="S0041">are you being serious?</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah they did <pause dur="short"/> that's how they That's how they went there and took over the land <pause dur="short"/> it's probably what they did in America but I can't remember but I know it's definitely what they did in New Zealand <pause dur="short"/> that's what the missionaries did <pause dur="short"/> so there they're preaching the word of God but in an actual fact</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0041">fuck</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0084">they're there on behalf of you know the pillaging armies now they're gonna go</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0041">holy</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0084">the women are going to be raped the children are going to get killed and the men are gonna be enslaved <pause dur="short"/> so it's all very well to say that we're the evolved western world when in actual fact we're less humane than anybody else</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0084">though the issue I have is this idea of natural selection <pause dur="short"/> a certain number of people have to die because the planet can only sustain a certain number of people</u>
<u n="1406" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1407" who="S0084">and obviously because of their they they don't have access to condoms men <trunc>don</trunc> men rape women</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0084">so they're constantly having babies <pause dur="short"/> there's no way that they can't not <pause dur="short"/> because there's no consensual sex there <pause dur="short"/> they're being raped</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="1411" who="S0084">they're constantly having babies they're more and more babies being brought into a world that that can't sustain them <pause dur="short"/> it's so it just beggars belief that we can have money and they can't <pause dur="short"/> our world is evolved but there's hasn't <pause dur="short"/> like how and it's because it seems so alien now because it's been allowed this gulf has been allowed to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger</u>
<u n="1412" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1413" who="S0084">at a time when we could have done something about it</u>
<u n="1414" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0084">nothing was really done</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0084">and so now it's got to a point where I we can't really fix it <pause dur="short"/> because the gulf is so huge between us</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0084">so really it's really hard but technology has come so far that you could actually transform the landscape if you wanted to <pause dur="short"/> companies could go out there and they could build irrigation in the fields</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0041">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0084">they could you know</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0084">greenhouses whatever it takes <pause dur="short"/> they can make the land more habitable than they have right now <pause dur="short"/> you can You can</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0041">but you can't you can't give that</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0084">invent clouds to come over <trunc>y</trunc> you can you know there are cloud buster machines now <pause dur="short"/> you can actually cause rain like people can now actually cause it to rain</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0041">but you can't <trunc>rea</trunc> give that to someone who is so <trunc>wh</trunc> so <trunc>n</trunc> so backward which sounds awful but they are</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0084">no but they're not stupid do you know what I mean? They just haven't been afforded the opportunity because we we're in the west and we're special and we've got the tools and we want to make our money ourselves <pause dur="short"/> we don't want to give anybody else what we've got</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0041">well someone must say to those men to rape is wrong and they don't understand that</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0084">but no But no I don't think anybody is because they're just being left to their own devices <pause dur="short"/> there's no one really there There's no one really there to help them</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0041">but how can they think that's right? Like in our in in England</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0084">because they're because they are barbaric in the sense that they haven't got they haven't been through the same civilization that we have <pause dur="short"/> but that doesn't mean that we're any more humane cos we did terrible things as well</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0041">but they must talk to each other</u>
