<u n="1" who="S0324">so one time</u>
<u n="2" who="S0325">one time erm she turned around and the same thing as normal laughing and and she's just I don't know what it was she just changed and crying and us lying on the table and I was absolutely dying I did that somewhere else as well one of the teachers</u>
<u n="3" who="S0324">maybe it was Mrs <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s class</u>
<u n="4" who="S0325">make me laugh always laughing</u>
<u n="5" who="S0324">Mrs <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is really funny</u>
<u n="6" who="S0325">yeah she's really funny</u>
<u n="7" who="S0324">in a good way funny though like laughing at her</u>
<u n="8" who="S0325">laughing at other certain teachers</u>
<u n="9" who="S0324">yes <pause dur="long"/> erm butter where's my is this my juice</u>
<u n="10" who="S0325">uh huh</u>
<u n="11" who="S0324">where did I put my juice</u>
<u n="12" who="S0325">it's there</u>
<u n="13" who="S0324">there it is</u>
<u n="14" who="S0325">we're going to get so many different teachers next year cos</u>
<u n="15" who="S0324">yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0325">cos for science you never have three teachers it scares me how like twelve lessons of science</u>
<u n="17" who="S0324">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0325">that's gonna be</u>
<u n="19" who="S0324">ridiculous</u>
<u n="20" who="S0325">that's more than maths or English</u>
<u n="21" who="S0324">yeah but basically the whole timetable is just science but still want to do triple science</u>
<u n="22" who="S0325">what if you don't do triple science you still have to do that much science</u>
<u n="23" who="S0324">yeah you still have to</u>
<u n="24" who="S0325">but with one teacher</u>
<u n="25" who="S0324">oh yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0325">nightmare</u>
<u n="27" who="S0324">yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0325">but what you going to choose do we do you know if we're getting any triple science option then</u>
<u n="29" who="S0324">no I don't think so it has to be one of your options I think but I'm not sure but I think so</u>
<u n="30" who="S0325">I wish it wasn't</u>
<u n="31" who="S0324">yeah but then in a way it's good because we get more time for science so we have more time to get a better grade</u>
<u n="32" who="S0325">but I really want to take art</u>
<u n="33" who="S0324">yeah well art is my number two option my first one is triple science</u>
<u n="34" who="S0325">uh huh</u>
<u n="35" who="S0324">then after then then</u>
<u n="36" who="S0325">French</u>
<u n="37" who="S0324">oh yeah French or Spanish I'm thinking Spanish</u>
<u n="38" who="S0325">Spanish</u>
<u n="39" who="S0324">but</u>
<u n="40" who="S0325">but because only general French is a bit more of a common language to</u>
<u n="41" who="S0324">yeah but then when you think about it Spanish is a more widely spoken language as in countries</u>
<u n="42" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0324">it's just that lots of people learn French so when you go to South America and stuff they will speak Spanish</u>
<u n="44" who="S0325">but</u>
<u n="45" who="S0324">only France will some other places do as well but only France speaks French and then there's just more people know how to speak French so I don't know</u>
<u n="46" who="S0325">but you guess you have a job and they needed you to do speak a language French would probably</u>
<u n="47" who="S0324">yeah I guess</u>
<u n="48" who="S0325">and what are you going to take last? music or</u>
<u n="49" who="S0324">well I'm going I did want to take music um yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0325">are you going to take a</u>
<u n="51" who="S0324">yeah I probably won't if I did I'd take geography</u>
<u n="52" who="S0325">what would you take instead of music and if you didn't take humanities</u>
<u n="53" who="S0324">then I would take music if I did take humanities cos there's nothing else I'd really want to do</u>
<u n="54" who="S0325">computing</u>
<u n="55" who="S0324">yep RE</u>
<u n="56" who="S0325">RE</u>
<u n="57" who="S0324">philosophy no philosophy and ethics</u>
<u n="58" who="S0325">oh it's really awkward cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like what are you taking and I was like I don't know and she was like are you taking philosophy and ethics and I was like no I just like oh I am and I was like oh oh right okay</u>
<u n="59" who="S0324">like how you've already finished your toast and I'm still spreading</u>
<u n="60" who="S0325">I think cos you were tracing your</u>
<u n="61" who="S0324">my little</u>
<u n="62" who="S0325">good luck trying to carve that one</u>
<u n="63" who="S0324">yeah and this one like flushing shocked face pain</u>
<u n="64" who="S0325">I think that I'm gonna take history but I'm not very good at history</u>
<u n="65" who="S0324">yeah you are</u>
<u n="66" who="S0325">I don't even like history <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="67" who="S0324">well then why do you want to take it</u>
<u n="68" who="S0325">I don't like geography either I like history because I like Mrs <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I like Miss <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="69" who="S0324">well if you take history you take someone else</u>
<u n="70" who="S0325">well she's going to be gone by the time we take our options anyway</u>
<u n="71" who="S0324">yeah but then she'll come back</u>
<u n="72" who="S0325">she's not coming back</u>
<u n="73" who="S0324">I thought she said she was coming back</u>
<u n="74" who="S0325">I don't think so I think she's going to have the baby over Christmas</u>
<u n="75" who="S0324">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0325">she said she'd come back for like a day to show the new person around and then probably that was it <pause dur="short"/> so I think she's leaving but I like Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0324">yeah I like Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> as well</u>
<u n="78" who="S0325">but I don't know I'm not I'm really not brilliant at history and I don't I don't really like history or geography I mean I like them but not really</u>
<u n="79" who="S0324" trans="overlap">do you want to take both of them?</u>
<u n="80" who="S0325">well I was going to but now I think I'll take music instead</u>
<u n="81" who="S0324">instead of which one?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0325">one of them <pause dur="short"/> probably geography</u>
<u n="83" who="S0324" trans="overlap">well <unclear/> would music be higher in your preferences than art?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0325">not going to take art</u>
<u n="85" who="S0324">oh okay</u>
<u n="86" who="S0325">because I can't take a humanities if I take art if I take human science with language humanities music</u>
<u n="87" who="S0324">oh yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0325" trans="overlap">art <pause dur="short"/> unless I take art instead of music but I think I'd prefer to take music</u>
<u n="89" who="S0324">yeah well you can still do art like</u>
<u n="90" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0324">go at lunch</u>
<u n="92" who="S0325" trans="overlap">after school and stuff</u>
<u n="93" who="S0324">and you can do arts award if you ever get round to it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0325">get round to it I started it before the summer holidays</u>
<u n="95" who="S0324">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0325">did about three pages and then gave up</u>
<u n="97" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="98" who="S0324">I keep meaning to do it</u>
<u n="99" who="S0325">mm mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0324">but I never get round to it</u>
<u n="101" who="S0325">I'm really worried that the end of year nine I'm not going to be able to get the level you need to take top set take triple science</u>
<u n="102" who="S0324">do you have to take a</u>
<u n="103" who="S0325">oh yeah but it's</u>
<u n="104" who="S0324">don't you remember Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and Miss talking about it like a six B or something you'll pass that</u>
<u n="105" who="S0325">some levels if I do really bad in my test but this one I don't understand anything <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> told me it's really easy</u>
<u n="106" who="S0324">you do understand that</u>
<u n="107" who="S0325">apparently it's the same one maybe I'll just when is it Thursday</u>
<u n="108" who="S0324">uh huh</u>
<u n="109" who="S0325">I'll get <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> to help me tomorrow</u>
<u n="110" who="S0324">got science and maths test on Thursday</u>
<u n="111" who="S0325">well at least you know what it's like now just remember on the last question you won't get unknown you'll probably be fine</u>
<u n="112" who="S0324">what happens on the last question</u>
<u n="113" who="S0325">last question I thought I was an idiot cos it even had an angle that said forty degrees I thought that it was I don't know radius meets</u>
<u n="114" who="S0324">so it doesn't need a tangent thing</u>
<u n="115" who="S0325">well it says why does it not need why does this not be a tangent and I wrote radius meets tangent ant ninety degrees actually the radius I have to prove that the radius doesn't mean a tangent at ninety degrees and then I crossed it out I don't know I'm rubbish in tests<pause dur="short"/> but um there were people talking and like <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> got really angry he was like how it's like test conditions I'm not impressed that people are talking</u>
<u n="116" who="S0324">that is true though shouldn't be talking</u>
<u n="117" who="S0325">I wasn't talking our table's like the good table apart from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who got sent out because well he didn't get sent out but he hasn't been doing his home work properly and so Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> took him out and like had a word with him because his homework standard wasn't high enough I don't know he just has to redo it <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="118" who="S0324">what are you no what were you going to say?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0325">can't remember no I was going to say don't know what I was going to say</u>
<u n="120" who="S0324">I was going to say what are you doing in maths now?</u>
<u n="121" who="S0325">I don't know cos we did the test today</u>
<u n="122" who="S0324">did he not tell you what you were going to do or something?</u>
<u n="123" who="S0325">no which is great we're probably doing something really hard like algebra actually I don't mind algebra</u>
<u n="124" who="S0324">I don't mind algebra</u>
<u n="125" who="S0325">that's cos you're clever I don't like doing the um well I like doing the balancing the equations in algebra I do them I remember I was so proud of myself Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> gave us one and I would be done before and you'd be like and then Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> was like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> surprisingly and I was like okay thank you and then and then that elephants project</u>
<u n="126" who="S0324">oh yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0325">even though I tried really hard on that and the level wasn't really and I was like yeah I got a level eight and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was like oh it's not really everyone got a level eight and I was like oh right thanks <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="128" who="S0324">do you want any more to drink</u>
<u n="129" who="S0325">um no I'm fine</u>

<u n="133" who="S0325">yeah it's like had test test test there's millions and millions of tests oh next Monday one week today is the French reading and listening test and on Wednesday the Spanish reading and listening test and on Thursday the French writing test</u>
<u n="134" who="S0324">we got so many tests</u>
<u n="135" who="S0325">I just realised the French writing test we're doing speaking and writing at the same time</u>
<u n="136" who="S0324">no we're not that's Spanish</u>
<u n="137" who="S0325">but yeah I missed it out</u>
<u n="138" who="S0324">no one one we are just doing writing we're not doing writing and speaking</u>
<u n="139" who="S0325">good</u>
<u n="140" who="S0324">I don't know how could I learn that</u>
<u n="141" who="S0325">neither do I</u>

<u n="144" who="S0324">it took so long</u>
<u n="145" who="S0325">but you learnt it</u>
<u n="146" who="S0324">yeah and I was really pleased with myself and then I came in cos that was for language features and all week of you just had like thirty words and I tried to get it down to twenty</u>
<u n="147" who="S0325">oh yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0324">and now they're thirty I'm not sure we were supposed to have twenty but then you all came in with thirty and then they were like oh yeah that's fine just do it with thirty but I was really annoyed cos I spent ages learning it and I only needed</u>
<u n="149" who="S0325">I hate speaking because the whole class can hear you</u>
<u n="150" who="S0324">yeah I hate that</u>
<u n="151" who="S0325">and there's much pressure cos if you get something wrong the teacher goes and they like raise their eyebrows and they're like oh for goodness sake</u>
<u n="152" who="S0324">um well it's it's fine when you get into it but starting it is really awkward and so quiet and everyone is like listening to you</u>
<u n="153" who="S0325">I know do you remember <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> in year eight and he did it really fast</u>
<u n="154" who="S0324">yeah</u>

<u n="232" who="S0324">cos then he was like oh I won't worry about if you're quiet or not and you were like no too late too late</u>
<u n="233" who="S0325">playing a game yeah no <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said she really didn't like the Hunger Games</u>
<u n="234" who="S0324">the what</u>
<u n="235" who="S0325">the Hunger Games were like the book and the film worst things I've ever seen in my whole life and I was like oh right and she was like Divergent was so much better but Divergent the film well in my opinion cos I don't think Shailene Woodley and Theo James weren't the right people especially as what's his name the guy that plays Augustus Waters</u>
<u n="236" who="S0324">erm and</u>
<u n="237" who="S0325">Ansor Elgort he's her brother in that</u>
<u n="238" who="S0324">oh yeah</u>
<u n="239" who="S0325">and that's just weird I don't know it's it wasn't the best film her acting wasn't very good but the Mockingjay was really really good</u>
<u n="240" who="S0324">when did you see it</u>
<u n="241" who="S0325">on Saturday the guy that plays Gale I think he's the best actor he's really good actually they're all really good probably why they're all famous actors</u>
<u n="242" who="S0324">yeah because they're good</u>
<u n="243" who="S0325">it was like a well thought out film I still need to find the last Divergent book</u>
<u n="244" who="S0324">oh yeah</u>
<u n="245" who="S0325">that would be really really wanting to read but I haven't been able to get it so I'll order that on Amazon</u>
<u n="246" who="S0324">yeah Divergent and the Hunger Games are very similar though think about it cos they're both like</u>
<u n="247" who="S0325">especially like at the start the start of the Hunger Games her mum is doing her hair</u>
<u n="248" who="S0324">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="249" who="S0325">and the start of Divergent her mum is cutting her hair in front of the mirror</u>
<u n="250" who="S0324">and it's all just all very similar cos it's like a female hero who heroine and it's action and the first is like it's</u>
<u n="251" who="S0325">like a sorting ceremony from Harry Potter</u>
<u n="252" who="S0324">yeah it's like</u>
<u n="253" who="S0325">which house will you be placed in</u>
<u n="254" who="S0324">and it's like erm action but then as the books go on they get more bigger and more political and stuff</u>
<u n="255" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0324">like the Hunger Games and like Divergent as well</u>
<u n="257" who="S0325">you will find out well I've read most of the first book but I need to finish it see if you know how it gets bigger</u>
<u n="258" who="S0324">it starts like Hunger Games starts with she's just a girl in the Hunger Games and then it gets more to her being face of a revolution and stuff more political</u>
<u n="259" who="S0325">really exciting Mockingjay part two is going to come out but that's going to be absolutely ages</u>
<u n="260" who="S0324">yeah that's going to be really annoying I I I yeah I have to say I'm annoyed that they did it in two parts</u>
<u n="261" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="262" who="S0324">cos it's really annoying when people do films in two parts</u>
<u n="263" who="S0325">I know</u>
<u n="264" who="S0324">the Deathly Hallows I can understand cos it is a big book and there's a lot of stuff that happens in Deathly Hallows but Mockingbird they could have got that in one film I think</u>
<u n="265" who="S0325">they would of but they thought I just want more money so</u>
<u n="266" who="S0324">yeah it really annoys me</u>
<u n="267" who="S0325">like it was only about two hours but they could of cut out some of it and stuffed it all in one I'm pretty sure the next one won't be so long</u>
<u n="268" who="S0324">yeah</u>
<u n="269" who="S0325">but it was really scary erm at the end like Kat and St Peter looked really scary cos peter had this really hollow oh I didn't like it you have to see it have you seen it</u>
<u n="270" who="S0324">no probably go and see it once the DVD's out</u>
<u n="271" who="S0325">yeah I'll have to get the DVD</u>
<u n="272" who="S0324">I've got the second one I'm not sure</u>
<u n="273" who="S0325">cos I got it for you erm so I need to get that</u>
<u n="274" who="S0324">I think what we might do is wait for Mockingjay part two to come out</u>
<u n="275" who="S0325">oh yeah</u>
<u n="276" who="S0324">then we can watch both of them</u>
<u n="277" who="S0325">cos then you can enjoy and just move onto the next one</u>
<u n="278" who="S0324">or like watch one one evening and then the next one the next evening and then don't get too annoyed that it's two</u>
<u n="279" who="S0325">I'm not sure I want to watch the next Divergent film when it comes up I'm gonna watch it but even though the first one wasn't that good</u>
<u n="280" who="S0324">yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0325">and like erm Tris and erm what's his name four aren't like I don't know they're not how I pictured them in the book</u>
<u n="282" who="S0324">yeah especially four</u>
<u n="283" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="284" who="S0324">like he's not right I know it says in the book that he has short shaved hair but I'd expect it to like become a bit longer or something and to be like dark sort of browny the actor was just not</u>
<u n="285" who="S0325">their relationship in the book and in the film was really different in the film they sort of act like they're best friends in the book they're not it's really different and Tris in the book has blonde hair like really proper blonde hair and Tris in the film has brown hair and Christina she's not how I'd pictured her have you see her</u>
<u n="286" who="S0324">mm don't think so</u>
<u n="287" who="S0325">she does not look anything like how I'd picture her or Al or Whip or none of them it's like erm must have I don't know</u>
<u n="288" who="S0324">I am a film I'm really looking forward to it Pigtails</u>
<u n="289" who="S0325">yeah</u>
<u n="290" who="S0324">I can't wait for Pigtails to come out</u>
<u n="291" who="S0325">really excited for that</u>
