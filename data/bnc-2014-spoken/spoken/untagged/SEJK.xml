<u n="32" who="S0454">yes and it's <trunc>r</trunc></u>
<u n="33" who="S0455" trans="overlap">I remember that one</u>

<u n="36" who="S0454">the erm returning soldiers</u>
<u n="37" who="S0455">mm</u>

<u n="40" who="S0454">were treated at that time</u>
<u n="41" who="S0455"><unclear/></u>

<u n="47" who="S0455" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="48" who="S0454">make changes but of course people who hadn't been to war didn't see it like that</u>
<u n="49" who="S0455">no</u>
<u n="50" who="S0454">they just wanted to</u>
<u n="51" who="S0455" trans="overlap">no no <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0454">keep going in the same way and they were fine with it</u>

<u n="54" who="S0455">yes</u>
<u n="55" who="S0454">it must've been doubly difficult for them</u>
<u n="56" who="S0455">mm <pause dur="short"/> what's <unclear>happening with</unclear> sort of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <unclear>novels</unclear> recently is what a lot of research you've got <unclear/> quite a lot of <unclear/></u>
<u n="57" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0455">because you have to be so knowledgeable haven't you? about the facts there's no point if you've got it all wrong</u>
<u n="59" who="S0454">yes that's right it seems like that author did</u>
<u n="60" who="S0455">mm yes</u>
<u n="61" who="S0454"><unclear/></u>
<u n="62" who="S0455">no I found it very interesting</u>
<u n="63" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="64" who="S0455">treated very badly weren't they? the soldiers on the <unclear/></u>
<u n="65" who="S0454">terrible</u>

<u n="71" who="S0454">Florida</u>
<u n="72" who="S0452" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="73" who="S0454">which was particularly bad because they had more lynchings there than anywhere else in the States and when they came back it was the depression as well</u>
<u n="74" who="S0452">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0454">so actually it was probably worse than before they left less work</u>
<u n="76" who="S0452">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0454">and the whites wanted to consolidate power</u>
<u n="78" who="S0452">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0454">so it actually got worse for them</u>

<u n="87" who="S0454">you don't really see that in the UK but</u>
<u n="88" who="S0455" whoConfidence="low">no</u>
<u n="89" who="S0452">it seems to be <unclear/></u>
<u n="90" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah sort of underlying racism in</u>
<u n="91" who="S0452">yes</u>
<u n="92" who="S0455">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0454">in er well yes er what I thought was interesting was the segregation <pause dur="short"/> was completely voluntary on both sides but very extreme like I remember the dining hall in <anon type="place"/> you remember when <unclear/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0455" trans="overlap">oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="95" who="S0452" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0454">ate in the cafeteria the blacks would all sit at one table and the whites would all sit at others that was totally by their choice</u>
<u n="97" who="S0452">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0454">I thought that was very worrying</u>

<u n="106" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="107" who="S0452" trans="overlap"><unclear>and <trunc>definit</trunc></unclear> <pause dur="short"/> mm well police do erm <pause dur="short"/> use additional violence they seem to don't they? when they arrest black people</u>
<u n="108" who="S0454">yes they do</u>
