<u n="252" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="253" who="S0301">but there's a large social aspect to it</u>
<u n="254" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="255" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="256" who="S0262">oh well I see where they filmed seventy-one last night talking about guns mm mm</u>
<u n="257" who="S0301">mm</u>
<u n="258" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="259" who="S0262">very good very very good there was actually quite an interesting character erm characterisation of a soldier who gets left behind and they've only just got to erm Belfast and they you know they're all a very erm fresh you know <trunc>a</trunc>about the whole thing even their commanding officer is <pause dur="short"/> cos they sounded like they just you know straight out of Sandhurst kind of thing and there's this section where you see how there is a sergeant who said they put all their riot gear on to go out into the streets and erm and the the the the lieutenant comes and says no no I want everybody in berets because I want people to see I want them to see that we are here to do a different type of job you know which is the peacekeeping element and I want to reassure people that you know we're not here to kill them erm and the sergeant says are you sure sir? he says yes I'm sure but when the scene plays out a whole bunch of very angry people turn up erm and you know <trunc>it</trunc>it's a riot you know a full scale riot on their hands erm and it's chaos just kind of reigns erm the these paramilitary I'm not quite sure who they were but they had like you know they had armoured cars but they went inside the houses and they actually were talking to the well they weren't talking they were saying show us where your fucking guns are you know and I'm not quite sure where they look more <trunc>milit</trunc> they look like maybe police military or something I wasn't quite sure they weren't the army erm they sort of wore black kind of big black coats that they had black erm helmets on sort of Kevlars kind of thing were quite dark coloured <trunc>cert</trunc>certainly not army anyway</u>
<u n="260" who="S0301">sounds like police actually</u>
<u n="261" who="S0262">the police though the police</u>
<u n="262" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="263" who="S0262">right so they were the police and they were quite and then <pause dur="short"/> they're doing their bit and then the army well the troop you know the soldiers trying to keep the line they're not <trunc>main</trunc> about to maintain it and er one little boy picks up a soldier's rifle runs away with it the soldier who's lost his rifle runs after the little boy and then then the whole big bunch of erm men just basically surround these two soldiers and er one of them just comes up with the pistol and just shoots the this guy straight in the face and then this woman who's actually Catholic stops everyone and says how dare you to all these boys to these men you know how dare you you know what are you doing? are you turning into animals? so this one soldier saved but in the whole big scheme of things he gets left behind and that's where the story starts so he's left in Belfest Belfast <pause dur="short"/> only with a minimal briefing of you've got to avoid this place called Delvis Flats or something like that <trunc>D</trunc>Devlers Flats or</u>
<u n="264" who="S0301">Divers Flats</u>
<u n="265" who="S0262">Divers Flats got to avoid there because that's hostile that's pretty much all he knows and then it plays out erm that's he's really trying to erm you know get himself back to the barracks more to it I don't think he really knows where the barracks are you know erm and that and then it's you know it's the story it's the drama but it's I thought it's very well done because it wasn't really about the it was supposed to try to show the complexity of who's involved so you had the army the police and undercover army I'm sure they were definitely in the barracks with these soldiers</u>
<u n="266" who="S0301" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="267" who="S0262">with these this erm B <unclear/> B erm you know what is it? B company but they were in civvy kit</u>
<u n="268" who="S0301">yeah</u>
<u n="269" who="S0262">and they'd wear like a pistol sling like a sort of thing like this you know</u>
<u n="270" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="271" who="S0262">so that's what they were wearing and they go out and they'd be doing they'd be cutting all these deals with all kinds of manner of people you know and you saw how much backstabbing and shifting grounds and even amongst the IRA you saw like how they all wanted to kill each other they didn't trust each other and you know it it was kind of <trunc>f</trunc> it was very well done though cos you did actually understand what was going on but it was complex yeah</u>
<u n="272" who="S0301">it's interesting it was a long time ago in seventy-one but <unclear/> dirty war</u>
<u n="273" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="274" who="S0301">mm</u>
<u n="275" who="S0262">but it's a it's a it's a good good to see that because you don't see many films really of of that period not cinematically anyway you know you don't see the you don't really see it I er I try to think back to a film I've seen that's covered that kind of area you know the the that particular period and I can't think</u>
<u n="276" who="S0301" trans="overlap">there are <unclear>none</unclear></u>
<u n="277" who="S0262">well there might be the orange that that's different though isn't it? that was more that was later there's was there was a very very good film about the orange march</u>
<u n="278" who="S0301">mm</u>
<u n="279" who="S0262">but that's different that's not the same as what you're looking at there I don't think but I remember seeing a bloody good film about the orange march</u>
<u n="280" who="S0301">mm</u>
<u n="281" who="S0262">really really good the orange men but erm but that's yeah the I haven't seen a film like that about</u>
<u n="282" who="S0261">kind of different isn't it?</u>
<u n="283" who="S0262">er yeah and actually was directed by a you know I think <trunc>Bel</trunc> from Belgium this director so it wasn't like he had any you know</u>
<u n="284" who="S0301">mm well you need someone who's rather distant cos he'll be able to</u>
<u n="285" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah I think you do</u>
<u n="286" who="S0301">look at something like that</u>
<u n="287" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah and try and make head or tail of it yeah</u>
<u n="288" who="S0261">well that's interesting</u>
<u n="289" who="S0301">well <unclear/> is so embarrassing with Irish you know that the <unclear/> the whole thing was just such a oh such a fuck up you know</u>
<u n="290" who="S0262">yeah yeah you saw that kind of in the film get the idea it's a fuck up yeah it's erm</u>
<u n="291" who="S0261">did you want another sausage?</u>
<u n="292" who="S0262">no I'm full thanks</u>
<u n="293" who="S0301">yeah I I think I'll probably <pause dur="short"/> I think I'll probably look at it when it comes out on DVD erm</u>
<u n="294" who="S0262">mm and I think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and yourself will enjoy it</u>
<u n="295" who="S0301" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="296" who="S0262">it's erm it's very well put together and you know you the the sense of the streets you know what it's like you know operating in this closed kind confined spaces and</u>
<u n="297" who="S0301">I I think there's a</u>
<u n="298" who="S0262" trans="overlap">bombs going off and you know car er cars on fire and</u>
<u n="299" who="S0261" trans="overlap">there's a a really interesting point about it that it it's it's erm a period that would have been recorded and filmed as part of television</u>
<u n="300" who="S0301">mm</u>
<u n="301" who="S0261">and</u>
<u n="302" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="303" who="S0261">if you go back <trunc>fu</trunc> much further that simply just wasn't the case</u>
<u n="304" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="305" who="S0261">that you didn't have that kind of that type of journalism going on</u>
<u n="306" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="307" who="S0261">so there's there's a</u>
<u n="308" who="S0301" trans="overlap">that's true</u>
<u n="309" who="S0261">a lot stronger record erm to base the film on which</u>
<u n="310" who="S0262">it and you did get that sense of that too in fact at the beginning when you when they do a they do like a erm Panavision erm sweep of Belfast and you can tell it's been colour corrected but it's a it's actually original footage</u>
<u n="311" who="S0301">right</u>
<u n="312" who="S0262">yeah you know so you get that impression they've really gone to the journalism and to you know</u>
<u n="313" who="S0301" trans="overlap">and the archives</u>
<u n="314" who="S0262">to archives and really try to get everything right erm so yeah be interesting to see what you make of it erm but the drama itself is very good you know you really are left it is suspenseful kind of film you know</u>
<u n="315" who="S0301">right and and the director is a Belgian is he?</u>
<u n="316" who="S0262">I think so yeah I know he's not Irish anyway he's certainly not a Brit erm I actually have to look into who he is cos I thought he did a bloody good job and the the lead actor who's the solder who's left behind <trunc>w</trunc> I was telling this morning that I've seen him on television he was in a series in the UK but it really this is his first feature film and it's really his acting that carries this film</u>
<u n="317" who="S0301" trans="overlap">well it's good mm</u>
<u n="318" who="S0262">very well cos it's really all about this soldier who gets you know left behind and he's trying to make sense of who to trust what's going on and people are trying to kill him and you know</u>
<u n="319" who="S0301">mm</u>
<u n="320" who="S0262">and he's just only arrived you know he's fresh off the boat kind of thing</u>
<u n="321" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="322" who="S0262">so doesn't really know what's going on</u>
<u n="323" who="S0301">I mean to a certain extent it's based on a known incident because they did and and it's to the British army's shame forever and one of the patrols they left a soldier behind and and he was executed by the IRA <unclear/> a weapon</u>
<u n="324" who="S0262">oh jees</u>
<u n="325" who="S0301">erm and the women closed in on them and they were banging bang bang bang on the <unclear/></u>
<u n="326" who="S0262" trans="overlap">banging on the yeah with the dustbin lids yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0301" trans="overlap"><unclear/> and shot them dead</u>
<u n="328" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="329" who="S0301">only seventeen years of age</u>
<u n="330" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="331" who="S0301">erm and and it's sort of one of things in the British Army mythology we'll never go there again type of thing</u>
<u n="332" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no no no</u>
<u n="333" who="S0301">and they know the woman who did it</u>
<u n="334" who="S0262">there was a woman who shot the soldier?</u>
<u n="335" who="S0301">yes yes</u>
<u n="336" who="S0262">crikey</u>
<u n="337" who="S0301">and she's in the Republic of Ireland and they <unclear>can't</unclear> extradite her</u>
<u n="338" who="S0261">because she's in the republic</u>
<u n="339" who="S0262">oh god</u>
<u n="340" who="S0301">yeah I know <pause dur="short"/> not because the Republic of Ireland wouldn't extradite her but they can't they can't actually put the evidence together</u>
<u n="341" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="342" who="S0301">they to and to to to <vocal desc="misc"/> pardon me to mount a convincing case <unclear>anyway</unclear></u>
<u n="343" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0301">in spite of the fact that her son was shot by the southern Irish army trying to do a hold up erm <pause dur="short"/> on a erm <pause dur="long"/> oops pardon me <pause dur="short"/> on a erm UPS wagon which was carrying a tonne of money at some <unclear>dockland</unclear></u>
<u n="345" who="S0262" trans="overlap">oh I think I remember that story yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="346" who="S0301" trans="overlap">he was killed dead</u>
<u n="347" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="348" who="S0301"><unclear>but</unclear> she's still running around in the er republic</u>
<u n="349" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0301">and and you know they've looked at how <trunc>p</trunc><trunc>p</trunc></u>
<u n="351" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="352" who="S0301">how how can we actually get the evidence together and seemingly they can't so she's going to go free for ever more so you know there's a lot of history and a lot of baggage about the whole Northern Irish campaign that everybody wants swept under the carpet</u>
<u n="353" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="354" who="S0301">which is fine</u>
<u n="355" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="356" who="S0301">things have to be like that eventually</u>
<u n="357" who="S0262">mm mm</u>
<u n="358" who="S0301">erm <pause dur="short"/> though that's painful it is painful</u>
<u n="359" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah that's painful yeah</u>
<u n="360" who="S0301">mm cos the regiment concerned who left him behind they were labelled as shit in the British army</u>
<u n="361" who="S0262">yeah which regiment was that? cos I couldn't make it out</u>
<u n="362" who="S0301">it was very unfortunate it was the Royal <unclear>Welsh</unclear> Fusiliers erm</u>
<u n="363" who="S0262" trans="overlap">Fusiliers yeah thought it was yeah okay yeah</u>
<u n="364" who="S0301">who up to that point has actually since been you know had been looked at or viewed as rather the major the crack regiment <unclear>of</unclear> the British army</u>
<u n="365" who="S0262">wow and then that one incident has er changed their reputation forever more</u>
<u n="366" who="S0301" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="367" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> crikey yes <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I were discussing that cos we were wondering whether some of that story had been based on something factual you know and I was thinking well it must be because</u>
<u n="368" who="S0301" trans="overlap">it was yeah</u>
<u n="369" who="S0262">it's such a yeah</u>
<u n="370" who="S0301" trans="overlap">it's totally based on factual there was one guy who was killed</u>
<u n="371" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well yeah</u>
<u n="372" who="S0301">but there was they made a second <trunc>b</trunc> guy who went on the run</u>
<u n="373" who="S0262" trans="overlap">got got on yeah that's right yeah yeah we that's right well that's right you see erm yeah they actually come back later for the body</u>
<u n="374" who="S0301">mm mm</u>
<u n="375" who="S0262">cos they can't actually get to it at that particular moment in time because the chaos just was you know out of control everyone was just getting into their army vehicles and trying to get the hell out of there</u>
<u n="376" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="377" who="S0262">mm mm</u>
<u n="378" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="379" who="S0262">it's just very a very very unfair yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh well I hope everyone has enjoyed their sausages</u>
<u n="380" who="S0301">mm quite good</u>
<u n="381" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="382" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="383" who="S0262">think it'd be nice to watch a film wouldn't it? well we'll have to have a look at your erm DVD collection dad but before we do that</u>
<u n="384" who="S0261">I was gonna ask you something else about erm when I'm in Germany meeting up with a whole pile of erm software entrepreneurs and erm one of the guys has he's just been to er kind of a gathering in the US and he came back and he's suggested this idea that we erm as a group erm have this kind of hot seat session he calls it which is basically you you get twenty minutes per piece erm and you pitch er pitch kind of what your business is about or your particular interest in something erm and and and a problem that you wanna have solved and then the group kind of help help you get over a hurdle I suppose <unclear>its</unclear></u>
<u n="385" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah yeah mm mm</u>
<u n="386" who="S0261">erm now interestingly through the kind of method of of kind of events over the last few days this guy's ended up scheduling it pretty much everybody within twenty minutes which means that we end up with a whole five hours of this kind of <unclear/></u>
<u n="387" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="388" who="S0261">which sounds a bit it's a bit <unclear/> frankly</u>
<u n="389" who="S0301">bit dramatic</u>
<u n="390" who="S0261">yeah bit yes</u>
<u n="391" who="S0262"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="392" who="S0261">oh is it? do you think so?</u>
<u n="393" who="S0301" trans="overlap">well yeah yeah yeah yeah it is</u>
<u n="394" who="S0262" trans="overlap">everyone has their turn</u>
<u n="395" who="S0261" trans="overlap">well that's quite interesting okay erm I hadn't really kind of thought of about</u>
<u n="396" who="S0301" trans="overlap">mind you don't say don't say that to</u>
<u n="397" who="S0261">no no no but I mean</u>
<u n="398" who="S0301" trans="overlap">I I think the way the Germans would play this is to say yeah well everybody <unclear/> and they've all got their twenty minutes have a look at the programme which one do you wanna listen to fuck off and have a coffee you know in between sort of? that's the German way</u>
<u n="399" who="S0261">right I see they'll be this kind of erm the way I I kind of appreciate it was you could have you could spend your twenty minutes and then you've got four hours or something sitting around or something listening to what everybody else is saying</u>
<u n="400" who="S0301">yeah</u>
<u n="401" who="S0261">you're kind of like how's how's the value there <unclear>balanced</unclear>? and</u>
<u n="402" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="403" who="S0261">sure you'll learn something out of other people's experience so it's a given</u>
<u n="404" who="S0301" trans="overlap">well <trunc>tha</trunc>that's probably true yes</u>
<u n="405" who="S0261">but if they're not practically erm relevant to your point in time</u>
<u n="406" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="407" who="S0261">you're unlikely to use them or find them of a benefit for for for all <unclear/></u>
<u n="408" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah yeah so <unclear/></u>
<u n="409" who="S0261" trans="overlap">so why would you?</u>
<u n="410" who="S0301">have a <unclear/> yeah that's that's that's Germanic</u>
<u n="411" who="S0261">so what I've erm been talking to some friends about is this idea of if the business a problem so this is kind of the I suppose the context of this this particular session erm what I did was talk about some of these various people in their they're starting up businesses I was talking to my friends about it and and I kinda said well there are all these people who are individuals trying to start a business by themselves so they've got to upskill and learn and do everything all by themselves to get to some kind of point where they've got enough of a customer base to get the software <unclear>product</unclear> up and running right</u>
<u n="412" who="S0301" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="413" who="S0261">and they don't have the resources to hire people generally so it is pretty much a long march for by themselves</u>
<u n="414" who="S0301">mm</u>
<u n="415" who="S0261">so I framed this idea of erm what if erm we could get er the appropriate erm skilled people together identify a particular objective for a session erm for the benefit of that person and their business but that it would by by doing this exercise it would propel it would make their business jump for some reason and it would be about not just solving a problem it is actually taking action and doing the work during the session as a collective group so you could imagine if you got together ten people to help solve a problem that might take one person erm three months to do and that maybe you could do all that in a day and this this kind of the grand the grand kind of vision of it</u>
<u n="416" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah maybe yeah</u>
<u n="417" who="S0261">so erm my friend seemed to quite like that idea and so then it made me think well and I've got this Germanic approach to things erm</u>
<u n="418" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="419" who="S0261">that that actually more <trunc>ha</trunc><trunc>ha</trunc> how</u>
<u n="420" who="S0301" trans="overlap">I'm joking about that</u>
<u n="421" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="422" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah I know I know</u>
<u n="423" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah but he was the one who wanted to get the slab of beer in doesn't he? he wanted to yeah</u>
<u n="424" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah this is this is right yeah</u>
<u n="425" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah he <trunc>too</trunc> he preordered the beers so that everyone could have beer</u>
<u n="426" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah he basically wanted probably sit around so everybody could have a beer while while we're all listening in on what somebody else is going on about</u>
<u n="427" who="S0301" trans="overlap">oh that that sounds Germanic that's</u>
<u n="428" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="429" who="S0261" trans="overlap">so so I'm kind of</u>
<u n="430" who="S0301" trans="overlap">that's a good that he's a good German</u>
<u n="431" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's a good yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="432" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah I'm kind of curious erm to get your thoughts about if I have my twenty minutes and I want to try and test this idea with <unclear>them</unclear> that it's not the right type of place and there's not enough time to really demonstrate the value or the benefit of doing such an exercise</u>
<u n="433" who="S0301" trans="overlap">I'm not <unclear/> I I quite agree but anyway go on</u>
<u n="434" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm okay so okay well that's interesting so what is what what what what approach might you take in <unclear/> to?</u>
<u n="435" who="S0301" trans="overlap">well I I I tend to think that if you're putting over a business case if you can't put it over in about ten minutes</u>
<u n="436" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="437" who="S0301">you haven't thought it through</u>
<u n="438" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="439" who="S0301">would sort of be my view but but it'd be you know the horse for courses seems terribly complex you know you'll need more time but as as an opener I'd say if you can't put it over in ten minutes er just give you a a feel for this erm I've got to go out and talk about erm and talk about the whole issue of erm erm the the the <trunc>vil</trunc> the village and the problems we've got with traffic etcetera etcetera erm and a particular a particular erm application which is for a new Tesco's erm er</u>
<u n="440" who="S0261" trans="overlap">down the other end of the village</u>
<u n="441" who="S0301">no not down the other end of the village</u>
<u n="442" who="S0262" trans="overlap">halfway <trunc>dow</trunc> in the middle but yeah it's the super <unclear/> place</u>
<u n="443" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah to in the er it <trunc>wa</trunc>was the er it <trunc>wa</trunc>was the er the car showrooms I'll be given three minutes</u>
<u n="444" who="S0262">wow it's not long at all is it</u>
<u n="445" who="S0261">that's as a part of what a planning erm hearing or something?</u>
<u n="446" who="S0301">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="447" who="S0261">three minutes okay right yeah so</u>
<u n="448" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah so you know it makes one think</u>
<u n="449" who="S0261">yeah of course</u>
<u n="450" who="S0301">it makes one think</u>
<u n="451" who="S0261">yeah that I I appreciate</u>
<u n="452" who="S0301" trans="overlap">get succinct</u>
<u n="453" who="S0261">I appreciate what you're saying and and maybe I didn't make it clear the the intention is that erm you have the floor for twenty minutes they're there to listen and to pitch in and help the point is is you pitch your idea in two or three minutes and then the remainder of the time you can erm get their support or their feedback on particular things so you've</u>
<u n="454" who="S0301" trans="overlap">oh well that's different</u>
<u n="455" who="S0261">got an opportunity to to</u>
<u n="456" who="S0301" trans="overlap">that's that's different that's different</u>
<u n="457" who="S0261">use them and test them to either find a solution to some problem that you're having or maybe to trial something out with</u>
<u n="458" who="S0301">no no no that that's different I I misunderstood I misunderstood</u>
<u n="459" who="S0261" trans="overlap">so you know you could say you could imagine this is some sort of device or product that I've just</u>
<u n="460" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="461" who="S0261">manufactured give each one of them and go okay have a look at it feel it erm point it at the TV see whether it turns on whatever it is</u>
<u n="462" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="463" who="S0261">and get their each of their erm opinions on it or something</u>
<u n="464" who="S0301" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="465" who="S0261">or something like that so I was kind of thinking we have this er kind of problem which is to hear everybody else took such a long time period of time and the and and the context of my idea is about trying to get all of that kind of thing done in a shorter amount of time if it if I actually had the time to apply my real thing I would say let's have a whole day and demonstrate how much value we can actually create as a group in a day</u>
<u n="466" who="S0301">you've got a <unclear>business</unclear> <unclear/></u>
<u n="467" who="S0261">yes that's that's true so I can I can tie that down as a message to two or three minutes that people get that but what I was thinking was you've got a big group of people so imagine like a lecture hall and and er somebody's got the opportunity to speak and not everybody can speak at the same time so it's always one by one typically in a group it'll be the ones who like to be heard or put their hand up and and the quiet ones who may have some good ideas don't really shout</u>
<u n="468" who="S0301">always the way</u>
<u n="469" who="S0261">so what I was thinking was to <unclear>frame</unclear> my idea and then what I want is their feedback and their opinions about whether it's something that might be valuable to them personally personally and also how they might imagine how it would work so if if I said to you you've got my attention for five hours and I'm bringing ten of my mates what would you like me to do for you? and can I provide you a ten times result on on what you could do in this period of time or something?</u>
<u n="470" who="S0301" trans="overlap">I think I I I think I'd I'd sort of say oh christ I'm not sure if I'd want to go in that direction to be frank I I think if you've got a very short <trunc>sp</trunc> period of time erm my <trunc>incl</trunc> my inclination would be to give them a teaser and they're I I I can do this and I can do that and I can do the other and just speak for a very short period of time and if they've got twenty or thirty minutes er you know if you give them a teaser they may come and say oh christ what are you bloody talking about? er what are you saying? you know what you could do? you could wa wa wa wa what are you talking about?</u>
<u n="471" who="S0261"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="472" who="S0301">erm and and then you've got the retention you're actually in pole position</u>
<u n="473" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="474" who="S0261">cos the other way I was thinking of it is taking them and simply just putting them into groups erm so you've not got the big crowd and saying okay as a group take this teaser problem away work on it work on it for</u>
<u n="475" who="S0301" trans="overlap">but you could you could</u>
<u n="476" who="S0261">fifteen twenty minutes and then I get four times the answers than everybody else gets for the same</u>
<u n="477" who="S0301" trans="overlap">well you could I mean you you could do that and and you know and that would I think probably entail setting the teaser all the more short</u>
<u n="478" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="479" who="S0301">probably</u>
<u n="480" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="481" who="S0301">probably</u>
<u n="482" who="S0261">so you get more effort and time gone into the thinking and and</u>
<u n="483" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="484" who="S0261">discussion</u>
<u n="485" who="S0301" trans="overlap">what the hell is what the hell is he talking about? jesus bloody christ</u>
<u n="486" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="487" who="S0301">that sounds <unclear/> listen what are you fucking talking about? come on ra ra ra ra ra</u>
<u n="488" who="S0261" trans="overlap">but you see that's the nice thing about it because if if we're doing this on on Friday and we're still there Saturday and Sunday then you've got all of this other time to get to know people and talk about your ideas in the background</u>
<u n="489" who="S0301" trans="overlap">yeah to yes</u>
<u n="490" who="S0261">so it kind of helps you go further than just this particular session</u>
<u n="491" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="492" who="S0301">yeah</u>
<u n="493" who="S0261">and potentially get people who are interested in trialling it out</u>
<u n="494" who="S0262">how <trunc>l</trunc> how large is the group going to be in this <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="495" who="S0301">I think there's about twenty of us</u>
<u n="496" who="S0262">I think that's about an okay erm number to do the first one without having to break people into groups cos I find with erm organising you know classroom and training and stuff like that it's <pause dur="short"/> trying to get people who don't know each other yet very well without a clear objective to actually do group work in quite a short amount of time erm you know it depends on the personalities that are within the group</u>
<u n="497" who="S0301">you tend to get the dominant personalities <unclear/></u>
<u n="498" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="499" who="S0301"><unclear/></u>
<u n="500" who="S0262">and it can be a bit <trunc>loos</trunc>loose and a bit kind of and a bit chatty and a bit not quite on task and you you know you don't wanna come across as being losing as you'd say the teaser part of it you don't wanna look like you're coming across going right come on you've got to you know give me something at the end of your group work I want some kind of result you know which is you you you really want them to actually <unclear/> each other's voices you want people to be able to say look <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you know I think I I think I understand what you mean but is it like this? or is it more like that? so their questions are the questions that are gonna set your thinking going about what kind of things they want to know more about so in some respects actually keeping them all together and watching looking and listening from each other is quite a good way to get those people who haven't actually even cottoned on to what you're really asking them to do yet to have a bit of thinking time and then put their hand up and then say something and then say something and there'll always be people who wanna go last because they want to hear other people's opinions</u>
<u n="501" who="S0301">yes</u>
<u n="502" who="S0262">they like to hang back to say</u>
<u n="503" who="S0301" trans="overlap">in fact I always go last</u>
<u n="504" who="S0262" trans="overlap">is go last yeah</u>
<u n="505" who="S0301">I always go last I have to tell you</u>
<u n="506" who="S0262">yeah so people like that they like to be given that opportunity to sort of order where they might go in terms of asking questions and then there'll be people who just won't ask questions cos they prefer to listen you know</u>
<u n="507" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="508" who="S0301">yeah so yeah it's an interesting point you you you think twenty is sort of the break even point for you?</u>
<u n="509" who="S0262">I think so yeah</u>
<u n="510" who="S0301">yeah</u>
<u n="511" who="S0262">in my in</u>
<u n="512" who="S0301">I I <unclear/> you know <unclear/></u>
<u n="513" who="S0262" trans="overlap">I often do that when I've done workshops you know I keep everybody asking me questions twenty people can ask me questions but that you <unclear/> it requires a bit of skill</u>
<u n="514" who="S0301">and and you've got a fair amount of time by the sound of <unclear/></u>
<u n="515" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="516" who="S0301">you know you probably got more time than you actually need I would have thought but you know see how it goes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="517" who="S0262" trans="overlap">I agree with dad like if if you talk less and get them to talk more they're going to find the whole session much more interesting</u>
<u n="518" who="S0301">yeah that's <trunc>absolute</trunc> I mean that's a <unclear/> none everybody likes the sound of their own voice absolutely</u>
<u n="519" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah and it's the same with me if I'm a teacher I'm always the same you know less teacher talk time more student talk time you know that's the whole kind of thing that you get you know trained into knowing that you've spoken for too long</u>
<u n="520" who="S0301">mm mm</u>
<u n="521" who="S0262">and and I think yeah if you prepare something very succinct but just enough to tease them into actually asking questions <pause dur="short"/> the questions then pose new questions and then <trunc>po</trunc>pose <trunc>ne</trunc>new problems so actually it's quite a a beneficial erm it's a beneficial process for you because if you actually had some way of recording the questions <pause dur="short"/> and some of the discussions around the questions you could help you really see where their minds are going towards first with this teaser</u>
<u n="522" who="S0261">so you think if you put the people into groups then you're kind of hiding part of the discussion</u>
<u n="523" who="S0262">at this stage yes once they got if you did group work at the end on a Sunday I think yeah you could do it because they've actually familiarised themselves and I think they've warmed up to each other</u>
<u n="524" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="525" who="S0262">but group work requires warmth for it to really be productive</u>
<u n="526" who="S0261" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <trunc>finger</trunc>fingerprints and stuff like that after the greasy sausage <pause dur="short"/> yeah?</u>
<u n="527" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="528" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="529" who="S0301">what's oh what's in the box?</u>
<u n="530" who="S0261">that's a good question</u>
<u n="531" who="S0262" trans="overlap">your birthday present dad</u>

<u n="536" who="S0261" trans="overlap">we're gonna give it to you this evening</u>

<u n="559" who="S0261">but I will show you <pause dur="short"/> erm I'll tell you the story behind it erm I've not actually had this out before but I imagine it's a reasonable sized poster erm a friend of mine created this and she erm she was an architect but became an illustrator</u>
<u n="560" who="S0301" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="561" who="S0261"><unclear>she was an illustrator</unclear></u>

<u n="564" who="S0301">right yeah</u>
<u n="565" who="S0261">so what she did was she researched erm all these different Hollywood films</u>
<u n="566" who="S0301">yes</u>
<u n="567" who="S0261">and found out all about about the details of the aeroplanes in them and then illustrated them</u>
