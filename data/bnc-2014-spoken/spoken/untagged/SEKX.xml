<u n="1" who="S0058">yeah that bookshop was weird <pause dur="short"/> it was kind of seemed to be mistaking classic for just a really old book</u>
<u n="2" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="3" who="S0058">so like they had lots of you you can tell when you touch the spine of a book if it's just a plastic cover or whether it's actually leather <pause dur="short"/> you know an old leather sort of</u>
<u n="4" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="5" who="S0058">or cloth binding <pause dur="short"/> and some of these were just plastic <pause dur="short"/> and just they were just from plastic books from the sixties of kind of Dickens</u>
<u n="6" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="7" who="S0058">not worth anything <pause dur="short"/> but they were sort of in the classic section <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> It's kind of the place where you'll either find nothing or you'll find an absolute gem</u>
<u n="8" who="S0179">for nothing</u>
<u n="9" who="S0058">for nothing <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> cos they won't recognize what it is <pause dur="short"/> so I had my eyes open for a nice Tristram Shandy <pause dur="short"/> but they didn't have any</u>
<u n="10" who="S0179">okay <pause dur="short"/> need some ice</u>

<u n="19" who="S0058">we're not just sizeist <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0179">uh <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> also to clarify it's not the obesity that affected me just the sheer repulsiveness</u>
<u n="21" who="S0058">yes <pause dur="short"/> if you wanna fat car have a fat car <pause dur="short"/> but <vocal desc="laugh"/> at least make it an attractive fat car <pause dur="short"/> the XC90 isn't unattractive for example</u>
<u n="22" who="S0179">no <pause dur="short"/> I don't think it's attractive</u>
<u n="23" who="S0058">no it's not massively attractive but it's not quite so repellant <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="24" who="S0179">but if you need an SUV</u>
<u n="25" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0179">well <pause dur="short"/> no one needs an SUV</u>

<u n="32" who="S0179">then that's a good option</u>
<u n="33" who="S0058">they really are very pretty</u>

<u n="41" who="S0058">uh</u>
<u n="42" who="S0179">it looks like council offices or something <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="43" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> interesting <pause dur="short"/> nice place for it <pause dur="short"/> it is the council offices</u>
<u n="44" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0058">you'll actually find it's like <anon type="place"/>'s maximum security prison <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> They've got some kind of invisible electric thing round it</u>
<u n="46" who="S0179">to be fair I'd have thought it would be quite effective purely cos there are no transport links to here</u>
<u n="47" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0179">you see <anon type="place"/> does at least have a railway station</u>
<u n="49" who="S0058">is that the nearest one to here?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0179">that or <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="54" who="S0179">you'd struggle to get far quickly</u>
<u n="55" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> have to hitch a lift <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> That's why you don't let people into your car <pause dur="short"/> in case they're escaped criminals <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> All the best stories have an escaped convict in them <pause dur="short"/> famous Five <pause dur="short"/> hound of the Baskervilles <pause dur="short"/> dickens</u>
<u n="56" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="57" who="S0058">it's all about escaped convicts <pause dur="short"/> how do you pronounce double F again?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0179">double F?</u>
<u n="59" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0179">I've no idea</u>
<u n="61" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> there was two guys in the bookshop <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if you heard them <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I dunno if they were talking Welsh or not</u>
<u n="62" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they were</u>
<u n="63" who="S0058">they were? Yeah <pause dur="short"/> so strange <pause dur="short"/> I knew kind of obviously I knew it wasn't English and it wasn't like Spanish or French or Italian or in er I knew it wasn't what it wasn't <pause dur="short"/> but I wasn't sure if it was Welsh or not <pause dur="short"/> but there were so many English words that were pronounced perfectly scattered in the middle of it I assumed it was Welsh</u>
<u n="64" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0058">is it more of a big thing round here do you think? Like sort of mid-Wales <pause dur="short"/> and sort of quieter</u>
<u n="66" who="S0179">no <pause dur="short"/> north Wales</u>
<u n="67" who="S0058">North Wales? Oh okay</u>
<u n="68" who="S0179">South Wales it's virtually non-existent</u>
<u n="69" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="70" who="S0179">Mid-Wales to some extent <pause dur="short"/> north Wales is really <unclear/></u>
<u n="71" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="72" who="S0179">mm</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="73" who="S0058">okay? <pause dur="long"/> Ah <pause dur="short"/> go-karts and paintball?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0058">is that the?</u>
<u n="76" who="S0179">no</u>
<u n="77" who="S0058">no <pause dur="short"/> I was gonna say <pause dur="short"/> this looks smaller <pause dur="short"/> it's er</u>
<u n="78" who="S0179">yes it is <pause dur="short"/> cos like to be honest all the good paintball <unclear/> that's your main business</u>
<u n="79" who="S0058">yes <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> The thing is er <trunc>d</trunc> I'm surprised that you can just do it as a kind of smaller things <pause dur="short"/> just because there's so much effort you have to put into <unclear/> and safety is such a massive deal and</u>
<u n="80" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0058">so why would you bother if it was just a <trunc>s</trunc> fairly small thing?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0179">well I suppose if you've got the facilities and the staff it kind of makes sense</u>
<u n="83" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0179">combine the two now there you've got a winner</u>
<u n="85" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yes <pause dur="short"/> now there's a game <pause dur="short"/> I just think well you know in terms of like if someone takes their mask off and gets shot in the eye and blinded <pause dur="short"/> er you I guess you need to make sure you're really really trying for that not to happen <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0179">to be fair if you do that you've pretty much got it coming <pause dur="short"/> as in you</u>
<u n="87" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> but I mean if you then went and sued the</u>
<u n="88" who="S0179">you couldn't</u>
<u n="89" who="S0058">you couldn't? Okay <pause dur="short"/> so long as they've given you a mask and told you in no uncertain terms</u>
<u n="90" who="S0179">mhm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0058">to wear it I guess</u>
<u n="92" who="S0179">and made damn sure of it <pause dur="short"/> they continued to enforce that</u>
<u n="93" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="94" who="S0179">that's bad</u>
<u n="95" who="S0058">what was it? I didn't see</u>
<u n="96" who="S0179">someone's turned that sign round</u>
<u n="97" who="S0058">oh <pause dur="short"/> fff <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Interesting</u>

<u n="102" who="S0179"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yes <pause dur="short"/> it is rather</u>
<u n="103" who="S0058">that's the kind of one where there's you know if massive herd of cows in middle of road stop <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="104" who="S0179">yeah I think that's basically how I'd er interpret it</u>
<u n="105" who="S0058">that's yeah it's kind of hard to  hard to  <unclear/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Maybe some drivers just need the lights</u>
<u n="106" who="S0179">mm</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="107" who="S0058">tiny little <trunc>p</trunc> random postbox there <pause dur="short"/> cute</u>
<u n="108" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="109" who="S0058">yeah I mean it's just it's nowhere near as remote as Ullapool and sort of northwards <pause dur="short"/> but got a very different feel to it <pause dur="short"/> it's nice</u>
<u n="110" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's nice weather</u>
<u n="111" who="S0058">nice weather did you say?</u>

<u n="115" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean there's so much more round here <pause dur="short"/> there's no sense of the feeling of being completely kind of out of it</u>
<u n="116" who="S0179">but no that's got its own attraction</u>
<u n="117" who="S0058">well no definitely <pause dur="short"/> I'm not saying it's better or worse <pause dur="short"/> I just mean it's just completely different even though they're both kind of I dunno <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah there's something nice about being so far from anything I guess</u>
<u n="118" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="119" who="S0058">this is more touristy</u>
<u n="120" who="S0179">it's just so much more densely populated</u>
<u n="121" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0179">it's just</u>
<u n="123" who="S0058">yeah there's just so many more people per bit of land <pause dur="short"/> but even when every single soul in Ullapool came out for that festival thing when we were there it wasn't</u>

<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="129" who="S0058">well seeing as it's come up nice we'll sort of I suggest <unclear/> while that um you sit down with some ice <pause dur="short"/> I'll unpack the food and sort of do stuff <pause dur="short"/> and then in the then once you've had a chance to recover we'll go down to the horses</u>
<u n="130" who="S0179">yes</u>

<u n="137" who="S0058">excellent</u>
<u n="138" who="S0179">to be fair it moves</u>
<u n="139" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> It really does</u>
<u n="140" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> as in it's not slow</u>
<u n="141" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="142" who="S0179">that's what I do like about this car</u>

<u n="146" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0058">it's nice that it's actually a really good car <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="148" who="S0179">yes it is <pause dur="short"/> it's got things wrong with it but it's</u>
<u n="149" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="150" who="S0179">er doesn't suffer from  And so</u>
<u n="151" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> in the scheme of things</u>
<u n="152" who="S0179">for <trunc>w</trunc> for the purposes of sort of small runabout it's perfect</u>
<u n="153" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="154" who="S0179">it's brilliant around the city</u>
<u n="155" who="S0058">yes <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Or mental Aberaeron <vocal desc="laugh"/> as we found today</u>
<u n="156" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="157" who="S0058">so you're out to give yourself <trunc>b</trunc> better visibility?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0179">yep</u>
<u n="159" who="S0058">yep</u>
<u n="160" who="S0179">I'm just trying to straighten it out <pause dur="short"/> cos the road</u>
<u n="161" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0179">weaves from side to side</u>
<u n="163" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0179">doesn't mean you have to</u>
<u n="165" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so you can go <trunc>s</trunc> just plot a  plot a  course down the middle of all the bends I guess</u>
<u n="166" who="S0179">yep</u>
<u n="167" who="S0058">then it's shorter <pause dur="short"/> and you can make better progress I guess is the idea</u>
<u n="168" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> except not getting out too far close to that junction <pause dur="short"/> taking the speed off now <unclear/> <pause dur="long"/> Again not the smoothest road</u>
<u n="169" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> No</u>
<u n="170" who="S0179">ah</u>
<u n="171" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Aw he had his little hat on <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="172" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> made of the hair of the people he's recently murdered</u>
<u n="173" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0058">he didn't seem particularly er</u>
<u n="176" who="S0179">hm?</u>
<u n="177" who="S0058">he wasn't being completely communicative <pause dur="short"/>  I think</u>
<u n="178" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="179" who="S0058">isn't it quite lovely and green <pause dur="short"/> the</u>
<u n="180" who="S0179">well we could potentially go down <unclear/></u>
<u n="181" who="S0058">um <pause dur="short"/> but I was thinking obviously it's er it's up to you but I was thinking tomorrow we're not really gonna be able to do much sort of city town wise <pause dur="short"/> so we could go out</u>
<u n="182" who="S0179">beach wise</u>
<u n="183" who="S0058">yeah to a beach wise <pause dur="short"/> cos that'll be open <pause dur="short"/> it's up to you <pause dur="short"/> I mean I think you should maybe go in and get some ice on that first</u>
<u n="184" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="185" who="S0058">and we can maybe go later tonight if you want to</u>
<u n="186" who="S0179">I think it'll be a mistake to do it more than anything else</u>
<u n="187" who="S0058">er yeah <pause dur="short"/> er er I mean we can always see how we feel later on <pause dur="short"/> but I suggest we maybe just hang around locally</u>
<u n="188" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0058">and then tomorrow firstly when your leg's a bit had a chance to rest properly and also because there won't be much to do shop wise we'll go down to the beach <pause dur="short"/> yeah?</u>
<u n="190" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="191" who="S0058">cool</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="192" who="S0179">I'm just thinking as an outside suggestion</u>
<u n="193" who="S0058">yeah?</u>
<u n="194" who="S0179">and I don't consider it to be a particularly good runner but I will just mention it</u>
<u n="195" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="196" who="S0179">er er but I think I sell you to a er slave ring</u>
<u n="197" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> sounds good <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm with you so far</u>
<u n="198" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="199" who="S0058">where's the catch? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="200" who="S0179">um</u>
<u n="201" who="S0058">it's not a great build up to a story</u>
