<u n="2168" who="S0262">anyway</u>
<u n="2169" who="S0353">yeah</u>
<u n="2170" who="S0262">but in the mornings I do fifteen minutes of of of breathing as in a particular type of breathing and at night I do the same</u>
<u n="2171" who="S0353"><unclear/></u>

<u n="2176" who="S0262">I would have like a massive like emotional release <pause dur="short"/> of stuff that I didn't know where it had come from</u>

<u n="2187" who="S0353">yeah</u>
<u n="2188" who="S0262">but I read the text and the text is basically saying that <pause dur="short"/> there's three parts to people there's the emotional which is what you are when you are in your mother's womb</u>
<u n="2189" who="S0353">mm</u>
<u n="2190" who="S0262">and then then you're born <pause dur="short"/> it's all about self reflection there's no way of</u>

<u n="2192" who="S0262">articulating anything cos you haven't got a language yet</u>
<u n="2193" who="S0353">yeah</u>

<u n="2195" who="S0353">yeah</u>
<u n="2196" who="S0262">that's when your mental</u>

<u n="2203" who="S0353">yeah</u>
<u n="2204" who="S0262"><unclear/> that that's normal that makes sense to me <pause dur="short"/> and then what this says is that when we make erm decisions in our life a lot of it is fuelled by stuff from when we were like really</u>
<u n="2205" who="S0353">yeah</u>
<u n="2206" who="S0262">very young individuals like even</u>

<u n="2217" who="S0353" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2218" who="S0262">stuff which it might not be actually all that good for you</u>
<u n="2219" who="S0353">mm</u>

<u n="2221" who="S0353">yeah</u>
<u n="2222" who="S0262">then you've got to integrate it but the book's kind of like</u>
