<u n="1" who="S0058">ah yep so you press it twice</u>
<u n="2" who="S0432">ah</u>
<u n="3" who="S0058">it's recording now</u>
<u n="4" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="5" who="S0432">thanks</u>
<event desc="0058 leaves"/>
<u n="6" who="S0432">so it was as simple as pressing it twice</u>
<u n="7" who="S0439">okay right <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="8" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="9" who="S0439">don't worry I'm not very technical either</u>
<u n="10" who="S0432">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="11" who="S0439">so don't worry about it</u>
<u n="12" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/> so have you done many recordings? for things already <unclear/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> does most of it so it's not me</u>
<u n="13" who="S0439" trans="overlap">I think I've done like maybe ten or something like that ten or eleven</u>
<u n="14" who="S0432">ah that's good</u>
<u n="15" who="S0439">they're normally kind of with similar people like with my housemate cos we kind of I live with her but it's really hard to actually spend a lot of time with her</u>
<u n="16" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0439">cos like I'm always out going to like the gym or something and she's always out doing something so actually pinning pinning each other down to spend time together that's really difficult</u>
<u n="18" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0439">so I kind of use it as an excuse to like pin her down</u>
<u n="20" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0439">and it's been really good so</u>
<u n="22" who="S0432" trans="overlap">oh that's yeah actually time to catch up in general anyway</u>
<u n="23" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="24" who="S0432">even if it's not like recording or anything</u>
<u n="25" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0439">yeah exactly like</u>
<u n="28" who="S0432">ah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0439">cos we moved in together in January and then the kind of we just didn't really see each other for like four months which is really weird</u>
<u n="30" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="31" who="S0439">she's my housemate but er and she's my best friend from school so</u>
<u n="32" who="S0432">oh so you already knew each other? <unclear/></u>
<u n="33" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah so it's been quite good that way and some of them with my mum but my mum rants so much and I've had to like stop it sometimes</u>
<u n="34" who="S0432">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="35" who="S0439">cos she ends up having like an argument I'm like I don't want to <unclear/> listen to this</u>
<u n="36" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0432">it's not it's not a conversation</u>
<u n="38" who="S0439" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> no</u>
<u n="39" who="S0432">it's just them talking for ages</u>
<u n="40" who="S0439">it's just them ranting it's like this is not good mum</u>
<u n="41" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="42" who="S0439">what are you doing? erm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0439">I haven't actually done any recordings with any guys which I think I don't know if it's a bit weird cos I have quite a lot of guy friends but just</u>
<u n="45" who="S0432" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0439">I dunno I haven't made</u>
<u n="47" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0439"><unclear/> done any recordings for men it makes me sound <trunc>ma</trunc> I I said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I was just like I hope it doesn't matter that there's no like male profiles but it's okay</u>
<u n="49" who="S0432">no I think at the moment it's pretty even so it doesn't matter too much I mean</u>
<u n="50" who="S0439" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0432">it's slightly more <pause dur="short"/> I think there's slightly more female</u>
<u n="52" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0432">speakers but</u>
<u n="54" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0432">it doesn't matter too much as long as it's generally going balanced anyway it's fine</u>
<u n="56" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's just weird like some of the things you end up talking with your like <unclear/> what you talk about with your friends and how you talk like most of the time I don't even finish sentences and they automatically know what I'm gonna say and then they start talking</u>
<u n="57" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0439">and you listen to it and you're like this this isn't even a coherent conversation</u>
<u n="59" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0439">like what are we actually discussing? but</u>
<u n="61" who="S0432">yeah it's quite good when you read it</u>
<u n="62" who="S0439">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0432">it totally doesn't make sense</u>
<u n="64" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0432">but then obviously it made sense to you at the time like <vocal desc="laugh"/> you obviously know what you're talking about</u>
<u n="66" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah you need context <pause dur="short"/> it's really peculiar</u>
<u n="67" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0439">but it's really interesting to do what are you actually gonna do with the data?</u>
<u n="69" who="S0432">we are just gonna add it to the</u>
<u n="70" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="71" who="S0432">our corpus that we've got already</u>
<u n="72" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0432">do you I don't know if you <unclear>need</unclear></u>
<u n="74" who="S0439" trans="overlap">I I know like bits of it but like is it you're just trying to track like which words people use and stuff like that?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah and how we erm just if it differs to how we write and</u>
<u n="76" who="S0439" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0432">if it's changed cos we've got a nineties nineties dataset as well</u>
<u n="78" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0432">so we're comparing it as well to see what</u>
<u n="80" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0432">we check like what topics we talk about</u>
<u n="82" who="S0439">yeah I've seen the board</u>
<u n="83" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0439"><unclear/> and things</u>
<u n="85" who="S0432">oh that's good</u>

<u n="87" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0432">erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah apparently we talk about education twice <unclear>the same</unclear></u>
<u n="90" who="S0439"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0432">as much now than we used to and stuff like that</u>
<u n="92" who="S0439">oh okay</u>
<u n="93" who="S0432" trans="overlap">but erm and then eventually we'll use it to erm like teach learners</u>
<u n="94" who="S0439" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0432">how we talk now</u>
<u n="96" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0432">so they we they get taught up to date stuff</u>
<u n="98" who="S0439">yeah cos like the French like I remember like the French I was taught at school was horrendously formal and didn't really make</u>
<u n="99" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0439">any sense to a French person when we spoke to them</u>
<u n="101" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0439">it was like why's this person speaking really formally?</u>
<u n="103" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="104" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0439">like one of my friends here is French and like we were talking not in French but I was trying to tell her like tell her stuff we learnt and she was like people don't speak like that at all so</u>
<u n="106" who="S0432" trans="overlap">no no no when I was learning Spanish and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> learnt Spanish as well</u>
<u n="107" who="S0439" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="109" who="S0439" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
