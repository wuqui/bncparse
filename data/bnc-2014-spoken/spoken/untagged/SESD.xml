<u n="2" who="S0254">er it's only five K <pause dur="short"/> er and they're doing them around and about there's not that many in the North West though the closest one to us is <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="3" who="S0253">related to</u>
<u n="4" who="S0254">related to poppies as in like remembrance <pause dur="short"/> world War</u>
<u n="5" who="S0253">yeah</u>

<u n="7" who="S0253">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0254">mm <pause dur="short"/> what's the name of the charity? Help for Heroes</u>
<u n="9" who="S0253">Help for Heroes</u>
<u n="10" who="S0254">erm <pause dur="short"/> so yeah so I think the money goes to that and stuff but I mean it's only I think it's fifteen pounds to enter and then erm and it's only five K <pause dur="short"/> so I thought it would just get me a bit of motivation</u>
<u n="11" who="S0253">mm</u>
<u n="12" who="S0254">to start running although saying that I did think right I should go tonight as well and I was like oh I just <pause dur="short"/> I can't be bothered</u>
<u n="13" who="S0253">I'm really bad</u>
<u n="14" who="S0254">it's dark and it's cold and it's wet and I just think I did my time</u>
<u n="15" who="S0253">I did my time <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0254">I did <vocal desc="laugh"/> seventeen miles in the wind and the wet on your own for three hours or something and it was just horrible I can't shake that</u>
<u n="17" who="S0253">no</u>
<u n="18" who="S0254" trans="overlap">even half and hour's now you'd think you'd be like oh yeah half an hour that's fine I can do that but no I just don't wanna do anymore</u>
<u n="19" who="S0253">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I genuinely don't know what's wrong with my motivation I mean <pause dur="short"/> I think my general motivation hit rock bottom a few months ago <pause dur="short"/> and then I dunno I just I can't <pause dur="short"/> get like I would like to start running again I just cannot make myself</u>
<u n="20" who="S0254">mm</u>
<u n="21" who="S0253">it's horrible <pause dur="short"/> but I think you have to kind of have like a moment where you're like oh I erm I'm really</u>
<u n="22" who="S0254" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="23" who="S0253">unhealthy or you've gotta have</u>
<u n="24" who="S0254" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0253" trans="overlap">an incentive</u>
<u n="26" who="S0254">well that's what that's it that's why I thought if I sign up to this then that might give me a little bit of incentive <pause dur="short"/> cos I'll want to do it in under half an hour</u>
<u n="27" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0254">erm <pause dur="short"/> so yeah so I thought I could do like three runs this week and then obviously I'm away next week cos it's on the twenty-sixth so it's not that far away really but <pause dur="short"/> I thought <pause dur="short"/> I'll try and get a few runs in</u>
<u n="29" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0254">but it think I wanna start doing different stuff really I still miss spinning I should just bite the bullet and</u>
<u n="31" who="S0253">get the gym membership</u>
<u n="32" who="S0254">yeah but <pause dur="short"/> just I dunno it just seems like a lot of money that isn't a necessity</u>
<u n="33" who="S0253"><vocal desc="yawn"/></u>
<u n="34" who="S0254">erm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0253">but now you're supporting your man</u>
<u n="36" who="S0254"><vocal desc="laugh"/> now I'm the breadwinner <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0253"><vocal desc="laugh"/> but you're you always were the breadwinner</u>

<u n="39" who="S0253"><vocal desc="laugh"/> nothing's changed there</u>
<u n="40" who="S0254"><vocal desc="laugh"/> but yeah so I dunno I quite like the idea of like badminton and stuff I think we should start doing that</u>
<u n="41" who="S0253">I'd be I'd be definitely up for that</u>
<u n="42" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0253">it's like you were saying the other day I think <pause dur="short"/> we both just need like a kick up the arse but then</u>
<u n="44" who="S0254">I think there's a lot to be said about like cos I haven't really ran at all since I moved in with you and think it's I dunno I think it's just that I don't wanna go out on my own <pause dur="short"/> really I'd just rather <vocal desc="laugh"/> be in with you</u>
<u n="45" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="46" who="S0254" trans="overlap">in front of the telly <pause dur="short"/> I'd be more likely to do it if you go with me</u>
<u n="47" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0254">cos I when I was in <anon type="place"/> and stuff like in the like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was never really around much anyway but</u>
<u n="49" who="S0253">you'd go with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> or something</u>
<u n="50" who="S0254"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> yeah I'd go with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> or like I'd text her in the day and be like you know do you wanna go for a run? maybe go for a run when I get in or there'd be nobody in when you get in so it would be like well <pause dur="short"/> there's not really anything to do there's no one to talk to so</u>
<u n="51" who="S0253">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0254">I'd just be more likely to go for a run whereas cos you're always you're here when I get in</u>
<u n="53" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0254">I just wanna sit and have a chat and have a cup of tea and then by the time I've done all that I've completely lost any motivation to go out or</u>
<u n="55" who="S0253" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="56" who="S0254">go for a run and when you're settled down like settled in and it's nice and warm and you just don't wanna go out again do you?</u>

<u n="59" who="S0253" trans="overlap">I</u>
<u n="60" who="S0254">as I'm running I'm like you should do this more often it would get easier and you would start to enjoy it again</u>
<u n="61" who="S0253" trans="overlap">it would it <trunc>wou</trunc> it does get easier</u>

<u n="105" who="S0253">I I think so but the isn't that the the the thinking behind that is because <pause dur="short"/> certain certain colours like before we've even opened a product or eaten something</u>
<u n="106" who="S0254">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0253" trans="overlap">certain colours tell our brain certain things</u>

<u n="118" who="S0254" trans="overlap">yellows and greens</u>
<u n="119" who="S0253">yellows and greens isn't it that kind of <trunc>coo</trunc> crisp and refreshing</u>

<u n="201" who="S0253">mm</u>
<u n="202" who="S0254">although saying that the Aldi version are now green <pause dur="short"/> cos it used to be Walkers were opposite but I think now they've all come in line with Walkers and salt and vinegar is green and cheese and onion is blue</u>

<u n="385" who="S0253">so you're not worried about getting hold of a reference?</u>
<u n="386" who="S0254">no I just need two references the only reason I was so panicky about that other reference is because <pause dur="short"/> on <trunc>y</trunc> your doctorate they'll base shortlisting</u>
<u n="387" who="S0253">right</u>

<u n="408" who="S0254"><trunc>y</trunc> no</u>
