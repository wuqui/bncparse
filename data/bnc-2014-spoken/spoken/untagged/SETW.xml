<u n="11" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that would do</u>
<u n="12" who="S0058">I'd like to talk about some fly-tipping huh ha</u>
<u n="13" who="S0179">yeah that would be worth it <pause dur="short"/> because ultimately it's the council's responsibility to sort it out</u>
<u n="14" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> like er er obviously it's it's er wouldn't be his responsibility to put that bollard in but</u>
<u n="15" who="S0179">well no you could say first thing we need would be for you to put a bollard in</u>
<u n="16" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0179">couldn't we</u>
<u n="18" who="S0058">if they're dragging their feet</u>
<u n="19" who="S0179">look I'd ring the site office first</u>
<u n="20" who="S0058">right okay <pause dur="short"/> I could mention the</u>
<event desc="sound of car revving engine"/>
<u n="21" who="S0179">oh my <pause dur="short"/> it's not a boy racer <pause dur="short"/> it's just a shit driver</u>
<u n="22" who="S0058">ha ha <pause dur="short"/> it sounds like they are rev the engine <pause dur="short"/> rar <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="23" who="S0179">look behind you love <pause dur="short"/> look behind you <pause dur="short"/> you're reversing</u>
<u n="24" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Has she gone back out again?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0179">she's going out the <trunc>ent</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> no no exit <pause dur="short"/> jesus that's quite dangerous <pause dur="short"/> god <pause dur="short"/> huh</u>
<u n="26" who="S0058">surely you can get round that side <pause dur="short"/> surely that's the point <pause dur="short"/> you think?</u>
<u n="27" who="S0179">I have no idea</u>
<u n="28" who="S0058">probably not where there are pumps <pause dur="short"/> scary</u>
<u n="29" who="S0179">how much would you like an open top car today?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0058">that would be cool <pause dur="short"/> I should have a headscarf on though</u>
<u n="31" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="32" who="S0058">or I'd end up with sort of like a fright wig</u>
<u n="33" who="S0179">I think that's a relative term</u>
<u n="34" who="S0058">hmm mm <pause dur="short"/> ah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0179">oh dear yes</u>
<u n="36" who="S0058">it would be quite cool</u>
<u n="37" who="S0179">as someone with a sense of humour comedy recently it's it would just be nice if with bearing in mind the sort of like eighty percent of the price of fuel is actually tax</u>
<u n="38" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0179">oh well the special thing is you actually pay VAT on the fuel duty</u>
<u n="40" who="S0058"><trunc>Righ</trunc> oh okay right</u>
<u n="41" who="S0179">um</u>
<u n="42" who="S0058">you pay tax on the tax?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="44" who="S0058">that makes sense <pause dur="short"/> ha in someone's world</u>
<u n="45" who="S0179" trans="overlap">yeah sort of</u>
<u n="46" who="S0058">it must be quite disconcerting having that guy sitting on his bike watching you fill up <pause dur="short"/> ha <pause dur="short"/> I'm watching you</u>
<u n="47" who="S0179">oh well we'll watch him fill up</u>
<u n="48" who="S0058">I'm waiting</u>
<u n="49" who="S0179">the good news is he'll be quick</u>
<u n="50" who="S0058">yes he will be quick <pause dur="short"/> presumably the petrol tank isn't massive</u>
<u n="51" who="S0179">no <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> unless he's gonna drink it</u>
<u n="52" who="S0058">he might do <pause dur="short"/> he looks like the kind of guy who might drink petrol</u>
<u n="53" who="S0179">to be fair you shouldn't</u>
<u n="54" who="S0058">oh hang on <pause dur="short"/> is he going at the same time?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0179">no</u>
<u n="56" who="S0058">no okay <pause dur="short"/> because he er might be able to use the petrol while the other guy is using the diesel</u>
<u n="57" who="S0179">oh right</u>
<u n="58" who="S0058">or can you not do that?</u>
<u n="59" who="S0179">no you can't do that</u>
<u n="60" who="S0058">oh right okay</u>
<u n="61" who="S0179">to be fair you shouldn't bike in jeans <pause dur="short"/> it's quite dangerous</u>
<u n="62" who="S0058">why? Cos if you come off you'll break your legs</u>
<u n="63" who="S0179">no um <pause dur="short"/> the point of leathers is if you come off and slide</u>
<u n="64" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0179">it takes leather a long time to burn through</u>
<u n="66" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0179">see the reinforced patches on the elbows?</u>
<u n="68" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0179">that's cos it that's what hits the ground if you <trunc>d</trunc> cos if you come off a bike at sixty miles an hour</u>
<u n="70" who="S0058">yeah and</u>
<u n="71" who="S0179">the impact won't kill you <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="72" who="S0058">the slide will take your skin off</u>
<u n="73" who="S0179">it will well you'll burn</u>
<u n="74" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="75" who="S0179">A massive friction</u>
<u n="76" who="S0058"><vocal desc="gasp"/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0179">and yeah it will just rip through flesh</u>
<u n="78" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0179">well the point of leathers is that leather is very tough <pause dur="short"/> and okay tough is the wrong word</u>
<u n="80" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't wear <pause dur="short"/> we did an experiment</u>
<u n="81" who="S0179">it's got a <unclear/></u>
<u n="82" who="S0058">in science in primary school <pause dur="short"/> we had to rub sandpaper for er two minutes on to different materials</u>
<u n="83" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0058">and leather you can't make a scratch on <pause dur="short"/> you know ha</u>
<u n="85" who="S0179">er I'm not sure you can do that love</u>
<u n="86" who="S0058">presumably it just won't let her get the fuel out</u>
<u n="87" who="S0179">uh</u>
<u n="88" who="S0058">some people are just really really impatient aren't they?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0179">yeah apparently</u>
<u n="90" who="S0058">ooh he's gonna be pissed off if it's double his cost cos of what she's been getting out <pause dur="short"/> look surely that can't work</u>
<u n="91" who="S0179">I don't see how that's working</u>
<u n="92" who="S0058">it's not <pause dur="short"/> she's having trouble <pause dur="short"/> good ha <pause dur="short"/> put it back <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="93" who="S0179">you idiot</u>
<u n="94" who="S0058">worked it out yet? Come on <pause dur="short"/> come on love <pause dur="short"/> come on <pause dur="short"/> got it? Ooh <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> She did look a bit there ha ha</u>

<u n="97" who="S0179">Jesus <pause dur="short"/> he just er he just went up on the pavement <pause dur="short"/> what the fuck?</u>
<u n="98" who="S0058">presumably he's trying to park</u>
<u n="99" who="S0179">are we about to be ram raided or something?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0058">he's making heavy weather of it isn't he?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0179">oh</u>
<u n="102" who="S0058">ah right <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="103" who="S0179">that was er one of the more special things I've seen yeah <pause dur="short"/> well what is he <unclear/> is truly special</u>
<u n="104" who="S0058">look <pause dur="short"/> put it back</u>
<u n="105" who="S0179">the problem is that it's a</u>
<u n="106" who="S0058">put it back <pause dur="short"/> put it back <pause dur="short"/> go on <pause dur="short"/> put it yes there good yes</u>
<u n="107" who="S0179">I think what's confusing here is there's two sets of pumps on each thing</u>
<u n="108" who="S0058">now now now wait <pause dur="short"/> wait for it to zero <pause dur="short"/> zero</u>
<u n="109" who="S0179">oh</u>
<u n="110" who="S0058">zero</u>
<u n="111" who="S0179">now if you look cos there is four options <pause dur="short"/> there are aren't there</u>
<u n="112" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0179">so there's four points but they're in sets of two</u>
<u n="114" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0179">so I think</u>
<u n="116" who="S0058">so she's assuming that</u>
<u n="117" who="S0179">I guess he looks quite nice</u>
<u n="118" who="S0058">doesn't he</u>
<u n="119" who="S0179">sort of huggable</u>
<u n="120" who="S0058">and that's great because he didn't need to move forwards to refuel</u>
<u n="121" who="S0179" trans="overlap">exactly <pause dur="short"/> that was very clever</u>
<u n="122" who="S0058">so it's actually quicker yeah</u>
<u n="123" who="S0179">it saved a huge amount of time</u>
<u n="124" who="S0058">yeah it was good <pause dur="short"/> that's presumably why he pulled right up behind them so that he'd be able to do that and save time</u>
<u n="125" who="S0179">yeah cos as soon as the other chap paid he could er</u>
<u n="126" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0179">get on with it</u>
