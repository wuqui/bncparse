<u n="16" who="S0058">oh it's really good</u>
<u n="17" who="S0473" trans="overlap">in er next month</u>
<u n="18" who="S0058">it's really really good</u>
<u n="19" who="S0473">oh right</u>
<u n="20" who="S0058">erm so the first couple of days was really sunny so we were walking</u>
<u n="21" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0058">but we did some canoeing and I thought we've got two days left when we and we spent two days just in the bookshops</u>
<u n="23" who="S0473">er but it's it's not during the festival?</u>
<u n="24" who="S0058">I didn't go to the festival it's it's</u>

<u n="31" who="S0473">yeah it's just full of bookshops?</u>
<u n="32" who="S0058">full of bookshops and some of them are kind of special interest ones so there's more of the like crime and fiction and I think there's children's fiction ones and some of them are just massive massive buildings with a load of secondhand books</u>

<u n="40" who="S0058">yeah I wondered if it was actually nicer because apparently during the festival the normal population is about ten thousand and it goes to something like a hundred thousand during the festival</u>
<u n="41" who="S0473" trans="overlap">right</u>

<u n="89" who="S0473">that's true</u>
<u n="90" who="S0058">that seems to work quite well for me</u>
<u n="91" who="S0473">I've found the only problem is well I don't read off a Kindle I read off an Ipad and I can I get easily distracted so if there's something in the book and I'm thinking I wonder if that's true or if that really</u>
<u n="92" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0473">happened and then I then I find myself <unclear/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0058">that's why I think a Kindle works quite well</u>
<u n="95" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0058">that you can't really use it for anything other than</u>
<u n="97" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0058">reading books</u>
<u n="99" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0058">it's like it's kind of easy to get distracted on to another book</u>
<u n="101" who="S0473">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0058">but there's no yeah you can't</u>
<u n="103" who="S0473" trans="overlap">you can't start</u>

<u n="107" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0058">and it's sort of the screen is really nice</u>
<u n="109" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0058">like I wasn't sure about reading on on a Kindle</u>
<u n="111" who="S0473" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="112" who="S0058">it's a quite a small screen but it it's really nice and I think an Ipad even if they managed to sort of dim it it's still shiny when you <unclear/></u>
<u n="113" who="S0473" trans="overlap">it is yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0058">a Kindle actually feels sort of a bit like a book and it's <unclear>a bit matt so</unclear></u>
<u n="115" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah yeah well I was reading it on a beach a couple of weeks ago and I thought this is crazy cos it's</u>
<u n="116" who="S0058" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0473"><unclear/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0473">it was very difficult</u>
<u n="120" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0473">but the nice thing you know I was reading erm Shogun</u>
<u n="122" who="S0058" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="123" who="S0473">recently you know I don't know if you know <unclear/> and this is full of complicated character plot twists and things</u>
<u n="124" who="S0058" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="125" who="S0473">and so to be able it's got some feature where you can just highlight a word and then it brings up every or a name it brings up every previous mention</u>
<u n="126" who="S0058" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0473">of that name</u>
<u n="128" who="S0058">oh that's good</u>
<u n="129" who="S0473">and so you can just kind of click through and work out what they what they had done already and who they were</u>
<u n="130" who="S0058" trans="overlap">that's really useful yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0473">so I've got brilliant brilliant</u>
<u n="132" who="S0058">I've just read erm a Hundred Years of Solitude</u>
<u n="133" who="S0473">oh right</u>
<u n="134" who="S0058">and that is a similar thing</u>
<u n="135" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0058">and it's really complicated and you've got all the characters have the same name as well because every generation the <trunc>re</trunc> they rename them the same names</u>
<u n="137" who="S0473"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh right yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0058">so it's an absolute nightmare trying to work out</u>
<u n="139" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0058">and there's like a family tree in the front so I was kind of flicking</u>
<u n="141" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0058">back to that and I'm glad I read it in print just to</u>
<u n="143" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="144" who="S0058">to be able to turn back so easily but</u>
<u n="145" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0058">yeah you find yourself having to write you know <unclear/> the one with the cow</u>
<u n="147" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="148" who="S0058">or the one with the <unclear/> so just to try and grasp at what it was</u>
<u n="149" who="S0473" trans="overlap">well well that's what I when I first started reading erm on my Ipad that's what I thought the problem was going to be was that normally I find myself writing things on the inside cover</u>
<u n="150" who="S0058" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="151" who="S0473">who the different people are and what their relationship is and so it's it's difficult to do but</u>
<u n="152" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0473">when I discovered this feature I thought that oh well it's it's better in some ways</u>
<u n="154" who="S0058">yeah that is really cool</u>
<u n="155" who="S0473">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0058">yeah</u>

<u n="187" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0473">in different er placements</u>
<u n="189" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="190" who="S0473">in different er parts of er of the organisation so that you kind of know everything er and then you qualify</u>
<u n="191" who="S0058">I see</u>
<u n="192" who="S0473">yeah well that's and I thought it worked really well the graduate trainee</u>
<u n="193" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="194" who="S0473">thing here which <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was doing erm</u>
<u n="195" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah just getting to see all the different parts of it</u>
<u n="196" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah that's right so</u>
<u n="197" who="S0058" trans="overlap">I don't know why they've changed it</u>

<u n="201" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah she was saying she wanted <unclear/></u>

<u n="203" who="S0058">oh right really?</u>
<u n="204" who="S0473">and she said they were planning to go back to erm or they're thinking of going back to it and I think it takes more work it's more erm</u>
<u n="205" who="S0058" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="206" who="S0473">kind of er time-consuming to set up</u>
<u n="207" who="S0058">mm I can imagine</u>
<u n="208" who="S0473">yeah but erm</u>
<u n="209" who="S0058">and it was for us it worked out really well because obviously <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> did a little bit with us and did some really useful stuff anyway for those few weeks</u>
<u n="210" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0058">and then has gone on to do something really interesting</u>
<u n="212" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="213" who="S0058">related to this anyway so I think</u>
<u n="214" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="215" who="S0058">it was kind of worth the time</u>
<u n="216" who="S0473">well she's seen every you know she's seen sales she's seen editorial she's seen the research side</u>
<u n="217" who="S0058">yeah so really <unclear/></u>
<u n="218" who="S0473" trans="overlap">she's really done everything yeah</u>
<u n="219" who="S0058">yeah I think that would have been kind of cos it's really hard when you're just starting off to think well I kind of like books <unclear>I just want to do</unclear> publishing</u>
<u n="220" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="221" who="S0058">but you'd still want to know what the options are <unclear/> editorial which is probably why editorial are swamped with</u>
<u n="222" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="223" who="S0058">people <unclear>buying</unclear> because</u>
<u n="224" who="S0473" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="225" who="S0058">it's sort of hard to know <unclear/></u>
<u n="226" who="S0473" trans="overlap">and yet editorial is quite in some ways in ELT it's quite difficult to get into directly cos</u>
<u n="227" who="S0058" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>

<u n="321" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="322" who="S0473">in the summer because they have those ski lifts still working or some of their lifts still working</u>

<u n="324" who="S0473">so you can get to the top and just walk down</u>
