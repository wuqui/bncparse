<u n="297" who="S0680">yes</u>
<u n="298" who="S0679">because I always thought it was interesting the erm the upstairs downstairs the downstairs bit of the upstairs downstairs of you know like things like stately homes and actually finding out how ordinary people lived cos history was all about the the posher people it seems</u>

<u n="317" who="S0680" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="318" who="S0679">they do more with the erm the other people because until recently they they didn't do anything about the Polish folk who were down there</u>
<u n="319" who="S0680" trans="overlap">no</u>

<u n="323" who="S0680">yes yeah <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="324" who="S0679">and that was I mean there were other things too and they just weren't weren't jobs</u>
<u n="325" who="S0680" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="326" who="S0679">and stuff with biology was very limited and when I was at school I wanted to do design stuff in art choosing erm er things from the biology slides you know</u>
<u n="327" who="S0680" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="328" who="S0679">when you put make a slide and you stain it?</u>

<u n="331" who="S0680">yes</u>
<u n="332" who="S0679">and that was thought to be a a non-thing to do</u>
<u n="333" who="S0680" trans="overlap">well that might have been and gone because that was big in the early sixties</u>
<u n="334" who="S0679">well nobody thought it was a worthy thing to spend time doing in art</u>
<u n="335" who="S0680" trans="overlap">well this is it you see the likes of erm <pause dur="short"/> early Pink Floyd used to do slides and things on their back projections of things</u>
<u n="336" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm mm mm</u>
<u n="337" who="S0680">which was an innovation</u>
<u n="338" who="S0679">yes</u>
<u n="339" who="S0680">and at college we used to do well it's like my pottery and things seed pods and cross-sections and all of that which was late sixties erm but it kind of had been and gone by the time you got to do yours probably</u>
<u n="340" who="S0679" trans="overlap">well maybe</u>
<u n="341" who="S0680">and wasn't considered</u>
<u n="342" who="S0679">it wasn't considered a thing to do</u>
<u n="343" who="S0680" trans="overlap">a thing it wasn't a thing it wasn't in vogue either really</u>
<u n="344" who="S0679">no</u>
<u n="345" who="S0680">and you see with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he did his electronic and electrical and he only had a you know half a term on these things called computers and they had this enormous thing you could add two and two on kind of stuff you know didn't do much you could write a little program for it</u>
<u n="346" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm that's what I used at university</u>
<u n="347" who="S0680">but erm that was you know in when did <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> come out of university? seventy-two three and then of course he did his he went to do his electronical things and then computers came in so that's why he sort of took up an interest in that cos that was the new thing</u>
<u n="348" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="349" who="S0680">cos it wasn't something you did at university</u>
<u n="350" who="S0679">university in nineteen eighty-two or nineteen eighty-three I was doing ecology and statistics and ecology and you had to use a mainframe linked to a mainframe that was in the States or something</u>
<u n="351" who="S0680">yes</u>
<u n="352" who="S0679">you know was and you know you put you punched it all in and whatever you had to do</u>
<u n="353" who="S0680" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="354" who="S0679">and then you got like forty-two out you know?</u>
<u n="355" who="S0680">yes was was it because as I say <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had to learn all that on his own really until he got into a company that sent him on courses</u>
<u n="356" who="S0679">and so yeah eighty-two and then by the time eighty-five the end of eighty-five no the yeah the autumn eighty-five</u>
<u n="357" who="S0680" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="358" who="S0679">we were getting erm PCs</u>

<u n="362" who="S0679">Windows eight environment or whatever</u>
<u n="363" who="S0680">well that's what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> found with the younger engineers erm <pause dur="short"/> they didn't know any history of erm some sort of things like I can't really think of anything sensible here but er not the examples but there would be something or other and they'd come across the problem they'd come across a problem and say we've got this problem and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would say well you've got to do da da da da to get around that and they'd say well why is that sort of thinking?</u>
<u n="364" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="365" who="S0680">because he said because this thing is derived from you know something back</u>

<u n="367" who="S0680">you know previously</u>
<u n="368" who="S0679" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="369" who="S0680">so that's how you know it's developed from that so you know on the logic of erm you know that's how that was kind of evolved so it's working that you know cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would say oh well you know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> did NT four or whatever which these young people didn't know</u>
<u n="370" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="371" who="S0680">and things or they'd come across something that had something that was a bit old in it and they wouldn't know what to do and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would say blah blah blah and they'd say uh? and he'd say well because that's the next one after NT four and they developed that from that</u>
<u n="372" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="373" who="S0680">I mean they didn't all work like that but you know he knew the ones that which they hadn't got any idea of what <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="374" who="S0679">no</u>
<u n="375" who="S0680">you know they <trunc>ken</trunc> they knew kind of erm like we say Windows eight and they or whatever and they'd know the the sort of more recent numbers but they wouldn't know</u>
<u n="376" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="377" who="S0680">things further back cos he'd been sort of on the more or less the whole lot of it</u>
<u n="378" who="S0679">and I rather suspect that erm <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> might be in the same in the same boat</u>
<u n="379" who="S0680" trans="overlap">yeah <trunc>al</trunc>although he's a lecturer rather than a</u>
<u n="380" who="S0679">well he's an academic at <anon type="place"/> but he he's</u>
<u n="381" who="S0680" trans="overlap">I don't know what his actual qualifications are in that sense</u>
<u n="382" who="S0679">no but he's he's in the computing area isn't he?</u>
<u n="383" who="S0680" trans="overlap">mm I mean he won't he may not know the ins and outs of it but somebody has to for him to have set up the stuff in the museum</u>
<u n="384" who="S0679" trans="overlap">yes so</u>
<u n="385" who="S0680">and that's why <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would have liked to have helped him with</u>
<u n="386" who="S0679" trans="overlap">oh yes</u>
<u n="387" who="S0680">with the Sun stuff he could have helped him with the Sun stuff</u>
<u n="388" who="S0679">that would have been oh he probably could have helped with all sorts of things actually</u>
<u n="389" who="S0680" trans="overlap">well all of it but he <trunc>recon</trunc> he recognised the Sun stuff cos he worked on it and he's probably got the spare parts as I say and he's got the Sun manual</u>
<u n="390" who="S0679" trans="overlap">yeah it would be brilliant if erm <pause dur="short"/> well if if</u>
<u n="391" who="S0680" trans="overlap">the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> memorial wing yes</u>
<u n="392" who="S0679">did I tell you I had that email from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>

<u n="394" who="S0679">and he still looks happy and keen</u>
<u n="395" who="S0680">yeah</u>
<u n="396" who="S0679">and in the email I sent I did emphasise about erm you know that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would have liked his stuff to have gone there</u>
<u n="397" who="S0680">yes</u>
<u n="398" who="S0679">and you know that cos in case he just forgot who we were cos it's been a while since we've been in touch</u>
<u n="399" who="S0680" trans="overlap">well as I say and it also would be worth mentioning that having <trunc>s</trunc> I think you mentioned that we'd seen it on a programme?</u>
<u n="400" who="S0679">oh yeah er well I I think I mentioned him originally</u>
<u n="401" who="S0680">originally because had <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> have had you know the wherewithal to be able to get there</u>
<u n="402" who="S0679">mm cos it's not like a million miles away but it is a bit awkward isn't it?</u>
<u n="403" who="S0680" trans="overlap">it's not a million miles but it's an awkward thing to sort of commute to</u>
<u n="404" who="S0679">cos that journey's a bit not very nice is it?</u>
<u n="405" who="S0680" trans="overlap">no it's little roads and things but if it say if it was if it was just like <anon type="place"/> or <anon type="place"/> <anon type="place"/> you know sort of closer round then he would have been able to sort of go probably</u>

<u n="407" who="S0680">yeah you know just somewhere on the outskirts but it's just that little bit too far</u>
<u n="408" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="409" who="S0680">but erm this is it you say to him as an ex-Sun Sun engineer and as an ex-Sun one of the <trunc>co</trunc>companies he worked for he was an ex-Sun engineer erm he he <trunc>w</trunc>would have er been quite interested in helping</u>
<u n="410" who="S0679">yeah well that sadly is not gonna happen</u>

<u n="412" who="S0679">but <unclear/></u>
<u n="413" who="S0680" trans="overlap">cos he did all the <trunc>s</trunc> he did a the Suns at <anon type="place"/> university you see because <anon type="place"/> has probably got I don't know whether he ever worked at <anon type="place"/>? but he he certainly did Suns at <anon type="place"/> in fact some of them may still have <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> well they won't now they've chucked them out but you know what I mean? they used to have his name in them <vocal desc="laugh"/> cos he did some for the now what was it? it was the was it the linguistics department?</u>

<u n="415" who="S0680">no not the linguistics <pause dur="short"/> something to do with language and speech and it might be linguistics <pause dur="short"/> which seems to be in the bowels of the earth at <anon type="place"/> university and there was this sort of little man who was like a little mole and he was one of these sort of characters unkempt with a sort of nylon shirt</u>

<u n="417" who="S0679">in this rather close erm warm room <vocal desc="laugh"/> which was not the best thing I think it was a bit fragrant down there and this boffin person this he was he was something to do with language and erm <pause dur="short"/> not from the point of erm literature and things but it was in the components of language and how languages are you know</u>

<u n="422" who="S0679">and he was the guy who did linguistics?</u>
