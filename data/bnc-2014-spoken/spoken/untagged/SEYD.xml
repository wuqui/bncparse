<u n="77" who="S0179">it's interesting in Friends though because they mock cos it's quite clever a lot of it but they but but they seem to mock cos well they don't mock Ross for being intelligent necessarily <pause dur="short"/> they're mocking him for being an academic</u>
<u n="78" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean academia is mocked yeah <pause dur="short"/> which I guess is different yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos they mock Joey for being stupid</u>
<u n="79" who="S0179">exactly</u>
<u n="80" who="S0058">so I guess yeah that it's not intelligent it's the fact that he chose to use that in a particular way</u>
<u n="81" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0058">I mean it is quite funny being a palaeontologist like that is moderately reasonable <pause dur="short"/> it's just when they mock academia generally and when they they sort of fall asleep <pause dur="short"/> I mean he's telling them about anything he's doing <pause dur="short"/> it's a bit like well</u>
<u n="83" who="S0179">nice friends</u>

<u n="89" who="S0179">no no they're interested in that but when he's actually saying what was in it</u>
<u n="90" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> anyway <pause dur="short"/> in all fairness like in um what's that film with Hugh Grant? Notting Hill <pause dur="short"/> they mock the guy who's the worst stockbroker in the world <pause dur="short"/> that's maybe because he's bad at it rather than because he's a stockbroker</u>
<u n="91" who="S0179" trans="overlap">yes exactly <pause dur="short"/> that was quite funny</u>
<u n="92" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="122" who="S0058">what cos of the dangers?</u>
<u n="123" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> I'm very health and safety conscious</u>
<u n="124" who="S0058">except when you pour salt <pause dur="short"/> and the top comes off of the salt cellar</u>
<u n="125" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh there's so many things that annoy me so much about the health and safety <pause dur="short"/> it's like there's so many things are inherently very dangerous that you let people do <pause dur="short"/> and on the other hand some things aren't dangerous but you massively object to like putting like keeping like but no they wouldn't like it if they knew I had a personal supply of plasters</u>

<u n="157" who="S0179">and we were meaning to go to this erm fish <trunc>rest</trunc> Scottish fish restaurant called <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> but we hadn't booked and when we turned up they didn't have any tables left <pause dur="short"/> so we ended up just sort of wandering about <pause dur="short"/> and we we went to an Iranian restaurant</u>
<u n="158" who="S0091">A <trunc>wha</trunc> a what?</u>
<u n="159" who="S0179">an Iranian restaurant</u>

<u n="163" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="164" who="S0058">but it was  it was  nice <pause dur="short"/> it was a bit like Greek food</u>

<u n="166" who="S0058">um</u>
<u n="167" who="S0179" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> was it?</u>

<u n="169" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0058">um but it's not like Indian food <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't hot at all <pause dur="short"/> it was just sort of lots of herbs</u>
<u n="171" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="172" who="S0058">and it was like served with rice <pause dur="short"/> but it was  it was  really nice</u>
<u n="173" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> and then my personal favourite <pause dur="short"/> saffron ice cream</u>
<u n="174" who="S0058">hmm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0179">which was bizarre <pause dur="short"/> you couldn't have very much of it <pause dur="short"/> it was very sweet</u>
<u n="176" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="177" who="S0179">I think I might have one of these <pause dur="short"/> it was sort of like eating gold</u>
<u n="178" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> hmm hmm extreme</u>
<u n="179" who="S0179">iced gold in fact <pause dur="short"/> ar <pause dur="short"/> oh dear <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> oh that reminds me um after lunch I've got something to show you from work um <pause dur="short"/> I've been doing a lot of electronics recently much to my sort of against my will but um I've been doing all sorts and like I now know er my soldering has been improving no end <pause dur="short"/> and and crimping and what not but um we've got this er I've got this thing on my iPad which you can design circuits electronically and sort of look at how they're behaving</u>
<u n="180" who="S0091" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="181" who="S0179">it's really cool</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="182" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> what to have next? mm</u>
<u n="183" who="S0179">hmm <pause dur="short"/> that's really good</u>
<u n="184" who="S0058">one of those or ham <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if I want another one of those salmon ones</u>

<u n="189" who="S0179" trans="overlap">go for it</u>
<event desc="sound of rustling"/>
<u n="190" who="S0179">mm cos what we're doing at the moment is essentially it's designing what I can only describe as a crossbow <pause dur="short"/> um as in it accelerates a um it's actually for an injector um so we're looking at how a needle array interacts um with human skin <pause dur="short"/> we're actually using pig skin because it was easier to get hold of <pause dur="short"/> um as in the local butchers didn't have much human skin</u>
<u n="191" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Strange that</u>
<u n="192" who="S0179">um <pause dur="short"/> but we're firing this needle array at a target at the skin <pause dur="short"/> it's from eight metres a second which is all about thirty miles an hour <pause dur="short"/> and the only way we could get it to do that was by having massive springs so and sort of cranking it back <pause dur="short"/> so it is essentially a cross bow <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="193" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Nice</u>
<u n="194" who="S0179">hmm <pause dur="short"/> there's the risk assessment form is going to be hilarious</u>
<u n="195" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Is it a very small cross bow?</u>
<u n="196" who="S0179">it's not actually a cross bow</u>
<u n="197" who="S0058">I know but</u>
<u n="198" who="S0179">it's sort of about this big</u>
<u n="199" who="S0058">oh okay quite big then</u>
<u n="200" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's moving pretty fast</u>
<u n="201" who="S0091">and what part do you take playing it?</u>

<u n="360" who="S0179">which I'm keen for</u>

<u n="363" who="S0058">yeah</u>

<u n="366" who="S0179">um <pause dur="short"/> um yes <pause dur="short"/> um we're also trying to have holiday plans <pause dur="short"/> excuse me <pause dur="short"/> so er one option is to go up to Scotland and have a drive around <pause dur="short"/> so we'll probably stay in <anon type="place"/> again <pause dur="short"/> and use that as a centre to erm sort of drive up to north the north coast and whatnot <pause dur="short"/> and another option is to go to Wales so go to erm probably er <anon type="place"/> Farm again or <anon type="place"/> possibly and er do some exploring from there because we've got some friends who haven't stayed there before</u>
<u n="367" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="368" who="S0179">erm ooh and I did I think I told you about my Channel swimming plans</u>
<u n="369" who="S0091">no</u>
<u n="370" who="S0179">in that case I this the goal for this summer was to do a Channel swim <pause dur="short"/> erm but it's had to be revised for two reasons <pause dur="short"/> the first one was my plan was to do it one year as a team of like four people and then do it the next year as a solo effort <pause dur="short"/> erm but I haven't actually been able I've only found one other person who's willing to do it</u>
<u n="371" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="372" who="S0179">which is a bit of an issue <pause dur="short"/> erm I mean and it's it's proving quite difficult to persuade people that this is actually a good idea</u>
<u n="373" who="S0058">rather than insane</u>
<u n="374" who="S0091">it's very cold the Channel</u>
<u n="375" who="S0179">well it's warmer than pretty much anywhere else around here</u>
<u n="376" who="S0091" trans="overlap">really?</u>
<u n="377" who="S0179">well it's warmer than the North Sea</u>
<u n="378" who="S0091">no no no the Channel is supposed to be very cold</u>
<u n="379" who="S0179">oh great <pause dur="short"/> now you tell me <pause dur="short"/> compared to like the Mediterranean or the Indian Ocean yes</u>
<u n="380" who="S0091">oh yes</u>
<u n="381" who="S0058">pretty cold</u>
<u n="382" who="S0179">um <pause dur="short"/> but um</u>
<u n="383" who="S0091">well I think it's always running the water isn't it through the Channel <pause dur="short"/> one way</u>
<u n="384" who="S0179">oh okay</u>
<u n="385" who="S0091">one way or the other that keeps it cold</u>
<u n="386" who="S0058">oh right</u>
<u n="387" who="S0179">yeah and it also slows you down because you sort of have to swim diagonally</u>
<u n="388" who="S0091">mm</u>
<u n="389" who="S0179">um as if you would if you were in a boat um <pause dur="short"/> but it also costs two and a half thousand pounds to hire a boat for the day <pause dur="short"/> it's insane</u>
<u n="390" who="S0091">Good gracious</u>
<u n="391" who="S0179">erm and you also have to pay the coastguard five hundred pounds to stop cargo ships hitting you <pause dur="short"/> which seems like good value for money</u>
<u n="392" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you're willing to pay that</u>
<u n="393" who="S0091" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="394" who="S0058">it's just it turns out to be really expensive <pause dur="short"/> you can't just turn up on the day and go for it</u>
<u n="395" who="S0091">mm</u>
<u n="396" who="S0058">you've gotta</u>
<u n="397" who="S0179">well you shouldn't</u>
<u n="398" who="S0058">you shouldn't yeah</u>
<u n="399" who="S0179">I mean er it's generally like</u>
<u n="400" who="S0091">but don't they have occasions when it it's sort of a mass swim the Channel</u>
<u n="401" who="S0179">no</u>
<u n="402" who="S0091">they used to have</u>
<u n="403" who="S0179">really?</u>
<u n="404" who="S0091">mm</u>
<u n="405" who="S0058" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="406" who="S0179">because only how many of those people died? Because there was only about sort of it's less than a thousand people who have ever done it in history <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="407" who="S0091">oh no I don't think so</u>
<u n="408" who="S0179">well there's a record kept like the first</u>
<u n="409" who="S0091">in in in my youth it was the best sort of popular swim</u>
<u n="410" who="S0058">maybe it wasn't officially registered</u>
<u n="411" who="S0179" trans="overlap">maybe it was a <pause dur="short"/> because</u>
<u n="412" who="S0058">maybe they just used to get in a do it</u>
<u n="413" who="S0091">oh yes <pause dur="short"/> I suspect a lot of people swam it and and nobody knew about it</u>
<u n="414" who="S0179">because the first person that did it <pause dur="short"/> it was in nineteen fifteen I think</u>
<u n="415" who="S0091">I don't know if it was a Captain <pause dur="short"/> I used to know his name</u>
<u n="416" who="S0179">was it Captain something?</u>
<u n="417" who="S0091">pardon?</u>
<u n="418" who="S0179">it was captain in the Army</u>

<u n="424" who="S0091">really?</u>
<u n="425" who="S0179">erm <pause dur="short"/> anyway the um so yes that goal has been postponed for a bit <pause dur="short"/> and this summer I was thinking of maybe swimming <anon type="place"/> or <anon type="place"/> or something like that</u>
<u n="426" who="S0091">that there is very cold</u>
<u n="427" who="S0179">I know <pause dur="short"/> well I was in <anon type="place"/> earlier erm last year</u>
