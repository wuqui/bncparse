<u n="2" who="S0439">yeah like I</u>
<u n="3" who="S0451">I I'm I'm yeah I need to email him and say that</u>
<u n="4" who="S0439">oh god he's going to get two emails from us now</u>
<u n="5" who="S0451">have you emailed yet?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0439">yeah I already spoke to him erm I sent him an email last week I didn't go to my training session on Thursday</u>
<u n="7" who="S0451" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0439">cos I just I was sitting at work and like I was really ill last week anyway so I didn't train at all and then after sitting at work I was like you know what? I don't really want to pay forty pounds to go there</u>
<u n="9" who="S0451">no</u>
<u n="10" who="S0439">work out and knowing that I'm not going to be able to do another work out until next week</u>
<u n="11" who="S0451" trans="overlap">work out yeah yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0439">because I just can't because I've got so much running going on</u>
<u n="13" who="S0451">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0439">I just can't commit to doing enough weightlifting sessions and therefore I won't get any stronger and even though I know the technique I still won't build I won't be getting physically stronger I think I've <trunc>stray</trunc> the the <trunc>st</trunc>stayed the same weight for like a good few months like I bulked not bulked up I got stronger</u>
<u n="15" who="S0451" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0439">noticeably stronger but the moment you stop training or you miss a few sessions your weight drops dramatically and it just it just isn't unless you really dedicate so much time to it you can't get any stronger</u>
<u n="17" who="S0451" trans="overlap">yeah because I I felt thought with your running you've definitely lost like you've lost loads of weight</u>
<u n="18" who="S0439">I haven't lost any weight I've actually gained it</u>
<u n="19" who="S0451">er I it doesn't I I thought I cos I <unclear/> that much cardio but I erm no you definitely have</u>
<u n="20" who="S0439">oh thank you I think I just like toned more like I know that I'm always going to have a big bum I've always had a big bum and I can accept that</u>
<u n="21" who="S0451" trans="overlap">that's a good thing</u>
<u n="22" who="S0439">yeah but I don't yeah I mean I don't put it on really here as much as I like I obviously I had like a slightly I had a I have a food baby occasionally but like I normally have an okay stomach so I'm not too worried about it but that's the one thing I like about Kim Kardashian she's brought it big bums</u>
<u n="23" who="S0451" trans="overlap">yeah yeah and the in and the out</u>
<u n="24" who="S0439">yeah she's brought in the small waist and the big bum that's the one thing I like about her everything else I loathe but</u>
<u n="25" who="S0451" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> I don't I yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0451">I don't mind her I think she's actually really clever with how she's made er so much money</u>
<u n="28" who="S0439" trans="overlap">oh yeah how she's like how she's manipulated the system and just made so much money out of nothing is a joke</u>
<u n="29" who="S0451">I <trunc>w</trunc> no I am really impressed</u>
<u n="30" who="S0439">oh yeah definitely but like I think I'd like to lose a bit more I'd like to lose a bit of weight but I always find that when you do like more exercise you eat more because you get more hungry don't you? so but no I was really like I was really nervous about this half marathon and then I did this fourteen K fifteen K run on Sunday and I did it quite easily like that's the longest I've ever done a</u>
<u n="31" who="S0451">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0439">normally I've only ever run ten maybe eleven at a push</u>
<u n="33" who="S0451">are you like dead after it?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0439">no I was fine actually I was quite good erm I was a little bit sore like my legs hurt and like it's really weird how you under bum hurts like the muscle under your bum</u>
<u n="35" who="S0451" trans="overlap">that's a good thing that's that's good though</u>
<u n="36" who="S0439">yeah so I'm really I'm much more confident now about the half marathon and I think like I quite actually enjoy running like</u>
<u n="37" who="S0451">amazing</u>

<u n="53" who="S0451">I was going to say and so much better to finish the run and be like I really enjoyed that</u>
<u n="54" who="S0439" trans="overlap">exactly yeah</u>

<u n="155" who="S0451" trans="overlap">like every other weekend so I'm really looking forward to that and like so with erm like weightlifting I think that's kind of like from to try yeah just slow down learn one thing at a time kind of</u>
<u n="156" who="S0439">yeah yeah yeah that's what I think I think sometimes you just take on so much that you just get that's what I said to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I was like I can't commit to anything and</u>
<u n="157" who="S0451" trans="overlap">then you end up with yeah and yeah you're going to end up like giving something complete like stopping everything</u>
<u n="158" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah so</u>
<u n="159" who="S0451">but yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="S0439">have to see how it goes like I said <trunc>lo</trunc> I'd I said I'd contact him again in September after the run so</u>

<u n="163" who="S0451">we're young we can't like that's <trunc>a</trunc> it is a lot of money</u>
<u n="164" who="S0439">mm think of all the shoes I could buy</u>
<u n="165" who="S0451">no but if you think about that for example that's what you should do is you should make yourselves spend at least half of that on something like as a treat</u>
<u n="166" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0451">if you do your running</u>
<u n="168" who="S0439">well that yeah that's the thing like I don't I don't treat me I don't have enough money to treat myself</u>
<u n="169" who="S0451" trans="overlap">yeah so that erm that's you can treat yourself nicely with that amount</u>
<u n="170" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah but it's really annoying when people are just like ah losing weight the first thing to do is cut out alcohol and going out I was like but I don't drink much alcohol I drink like one glass of wine a week not even that</u>
<u n="171" who="S0451" trans="overlap">mm yeah yeah</u>

<u n="177" who="S0451" trans="overlap">no no I do I'd rather I'd rather eat</u>
<u n="178" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="179" who="S0451">like to make myself feel better I would rather sit and eat some</u>
<u n="180" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0451">cereal is my thing</u>
<u n="182" who="S0439" trans="overlap">like I bought I bought a really nice bottle of Prosecco at the weekend</u>
