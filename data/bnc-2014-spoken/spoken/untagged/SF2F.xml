<u n="194" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I knowing it's not being privatized as such by name but <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> I think like for what</u>
<u n="195" who="S0115">but it's not the same as America's one and it's it's always gonna have that sort of centralized feel I <trunc>su</trunc> I suppose um <pause dur="short"/> but uh</u>
<u n="196" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I don't <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="197" who="S0115">but it it I believe there's a problem in certain companies with certain private <pause dur="short"/> there's a lot of outsourcing to private companies</u>
<u n="198" who="S0037">mm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0115">part of the problem with that is the sort of monopoly aspect of uh</u>
<u n="200" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="201" who="S0115">or um it it's not quite a monopoly but it you know the thing with the <trunc>T</trunc> well we did think we we've talked before about the uh the like the TV the entertainment stuff and the internet stuff</u>
<u n="202" who="S0037">oh yeah</u>
<u n="203" who="S0115">um like <pause dur="short"/> about how <trunc>y</trunc> you're you're um a captive audience and you have to pay  you have to pay  uh a <trunc>v</trunc> a really uh extortionate fee fee to just to be able to watch TV um</u>
<u n="204" who="S0037" trans="overlap">oh it's horrible I hate all that thing <pause dur="short"/> and also like <pause dur="short"/> I think <pause dur="short"/> and also the the thing about like</u>
<u n="205" who="S0115" trans="overlap">which so but of course there's there's no way that the customer can can choose uh different services there there's only that one private service possibly available from that bed and they can't go anywhere since they're they're stuck in the bed so they're that is a forced monopoly which is always um</u>
<u n="206" who="S0037" trans="overlap">feeding the <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and like <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's horrible <pause dur="short"/> and like feeding the patients shit but then giving them the guests like the in the canteen having all like nice food</u>
<u n="207" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah the the sort of desperation to raise um money is is the problem that that hits that like if you  if you  make um</u>
<u n="208" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="209" who="S0115">if you make uh <trunc>m</trunc> um if you want to introduce like obviously uh a lot of money making um strategies it would you're gonna you um you aren't gonna find things like um <trunc>de</trunc> you know desperation to make money and and raising <trunc>ev</trunc> all possible</u>
<u n="210" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0115">any any price that would possibly be able to go up would go up <pause dur="short"/> and uh and yeah charging charging a patient ten pounds a day to watch TV for example is uh is is uh is it's partly desperation and also of course it's very unfair because they can't um have they have no ability to to to choose another service although I don't know what they do with laptops if they allow them um which they probably should do</u>
<u n="212" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know shocking <pause dur="short"/> opt out like <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think you weren't <trunc>be</trunc> allowed them before but I think you sort of are now but I'm not sure</u>
<u n="213" who="S0115">um so yeah well I think I already talked about that but I mean if I I don't understand like what they were doing with the uh NHS now I don't  I don't  um</u>
<u n="214" who="S0037">I think it was gonna be that they would let let doctors choose how they should spend the money <pause dur="short"/> I dunno the for me the government seems to the Conservative government seems to really like like it can't be arsed like it's just putting the onus on everyone else like did you read that thing about A levels in the news?</u>

<u n="223" who="S0115">what's the advantage of it?</u>
<u n="224" who="S0037">well he's saying he said he wants them to be more rigorous <pause dur="short"/> he wants to do away with the option to do modules <pause dur="short"/> he wants to</u>
<u n="225" who="S0115">whereas <trunc>mo</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> no I would've thought modules were could be a good thing cos then you'd have a wider range of um knowledge that probably it's likely to help you get a job and probably likely to help you in university</u>
<u n="226" who="S0037" trans="overlap">of course I mean <pause dur="short"/> but it's presumptuous to think that A levels are <trunc>on</trunc></u>

<u n="228" who="S0037" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> probably <pause dur="short"/> but I think <pause dur="short"/> he's just being elitist by saying that <pause dur="short"/> like he said that the Russell Group you know the Russell Group should set A levels so he's offended not only like all other universities in the United Kingdom but for example like A level teachers who perhaps have a better place to know what's working and what's not um</u>
<u n="229" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> I don't know though because this is this actually gonna? Well the Russell not all the Russell Groups are that that great anyway is it I mean?</u>

<u n="231" who="S0115">no I you  I you  can't insult a whole university but you can say that there may be they're not <trunc>alway</trunc> it's not always that um</u>
<u n="232" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well <anon type="place"/>'s not in the Russell Group but there's another group of like the <trunc>r</trunc> the best the most sort of research intensive and <anon type="place"/>'s in that one <pause dur="short"/> but but anyway</u>
<u n="233" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah I mean <trunc>w</trunc> I just uh how does I mean where do they even you know where do they get these these ideas <trunc>u</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> is this just the university themselves proposed that idea?</u>
<u n="234" who="S0037" trans="overlap">basically <pause dur="short"/> no not all it's they're like ooh we're a bit surprised by that and we're like there was a woman on This Morning saying you know universities are so overstretched and now they want us to set the A level things as well and <pause dur="short"/> you know it just seems a bit weird <pause dur="short"/> it's just like some Daily Mail view like exams are easy that's basically what that's come from <pause dur="short"/> you know?</u>
<u n="235" who="S0115"><trunc>R</trunc> really has it come from that?</u>
<u n="236" who="S0037">well that's my opinion</u>
<u n="237" who="S0115">why but but how many uh but <trunc>w</trunc> why wouldn't they want their? Wouldn't people want their exams to be? Wouldn't people want exams to be easier for their own children but harder for everyone else? Sort of in a not my not in my back yard sort of thing</u>
<u n="238" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well older older people think that A levels are easier now don't they? Oh I don't know <pause dur="short"/> but I just thought that was stupid I just thought he was just trying to put it onto other people like they're not tackling any problems</u>

<u n="244" who="S0037">maybe that's not the case</u>
<u n="245" who="S0115">yeah so the main story in the on this one seems to have been the introduction of something called uh um Big Society Capital I mean <trunc>w</trunc> what is? You obviously haven't you haven't heard of that have you?</u>
<u n="246" who="S0037" trans="overlap">what Cameron? No not really I mean I I've heard of his Big Society ideas <pause dur="short"/> none of which I've been particularly like bowled over by but that's just me</u>
<u n="247" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>w</trunc> the it's not easy to just sort of tell people to do stuff for free <pause dur="short"/> um</u>

<u n="252" who="S0037">sorry</u>
<u n="253" who="S0115" trans="overlap">uh because they would say that <pause dur="short"/> you know like with the uh where they tried to get people to to work for nothing um</u>

<u n="259" who="S0115">I dunno well the companies pulled out so um if the companies pulled out then somebody uh well the customers must've complained <trunc>o</trunc> or</u>
<u n="260" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="261" who="S0115">someone scared <trunc>u</trunc> cos like some of those companies like Tesco are are you know as powerful if not more powerful than the government itself <pause dur="short"/> so if when they if they change their minds then they must've really been scared by it <pause dur="short"/> uh probably <trunc>s</trunc> some aspect of the media were yeah maybe media sort of <trunc>s</trunc> tried to scare them out of it but</u>
<u n="262" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well it was just bad press wasn't it? Yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm all for people being given chances though but if they're just being taken advantage of then I mean that's obviously not cool</u>

<u n="265" who="S0115">to to try and get people into into jobs but <pause dur="short"/> I would  I would  think if you wanna force somebody to work you can at least force them and then pay them not not force them and then give them the same that they had before that that's a difficult issue it's different here <trunc>o</trunc> than in America isn't it because like they're not  they're not  really cutting in the same way are they?</u>
<u n="266" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> um I don't know</u>
<u n="267" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I guess it depends on the state obviously but here the message is absolutely you know um austerity and cutting everything whereas in uh I think in America they they've they've decided to <trunc>s</trunc> to put in loads more um money <pause dur="short"/> they've basically not currently um</u>
<u n="268" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> what's that called again?</u>

<u n="272" who="S0037" trans="overlap">quantitative easing? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="273" who="S0115">and then that's uh I think that just means printing money um</u>
<u n="274" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> I wish they'd just say that</u>
<u n="275" who="S0115" trans="overlap">like <pause dur="short"/> but um <pause dur="short"/> and it's it uh it bonds um like bonds are issued <pause dur="short"/> uh that's the Bank Of England loans the government money then gets takes the bond or something like that <pause dur="short"/> and then as the Bank Of England has loaned the money then</u>
<u n="276" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="277" who="S0115">um that means the money gets to be printed <pause dur="short"/> it's injected <pause dur="short"/> another yeah they did there were three hundred billion or something recently <pause dur="short"/> the um extra money was printed</u>
<u n="278" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I find it <pause dur="short"/> I find I</u>
<u n="279" who="S0115">but it America though they're more sort of <pause dur="short"/> I think they've increased <pause dur="short"/> they had the bailout package which which was uh something that was um there was a lot of news about that I think back in whenever it was <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and they're so they they have a really enormous amount of money that was injected into um into their economy</u>
<u n="280" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0115">um which is the world's biggest um and uh that seems to me to be a slightly different technique to what's going in over in Europe it's seems to be always um apart from maybe some of the more successful countries like Germany pretty much everyone's just um basically chopping the</u>
<u n="282" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="283" who="S0115">it uh just just reducing um spending and and cutting um cutting government spending cutting funding for things um so just struggling to sort of define that</u>
<u n="284" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well I dunno I find it hard to follow like I suppose it's not <pause dur="short"/> I suppose that it's got I'm not like really massively interested in um economics</u>
<u n="285" who="S0115">yeah I know well it it can be <trunc>ver</trunc> it can be very boring I understand why people find it boring because they it's quite technical and <pause dur="short"/> it's also depressing as well but I  but I  think it has uh a huge <trunc>u</trunc> impact on people's daily lives</u>
<u n="286" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="287" who="S0115">from the number of buses to uh <trunc>ho</trunc> how much it costs to buy food to fuel to everything <trunc>y</trunc> it's all like connected in in the economics isn't it? Um</u>
<u n="288" who="S0037" trans="overlap">oh no I can  I can  see why</u>
<u n="289" who="S0115">and I I mean obviously uh you know fuel prices are a good example of uh</u>
<u n="290" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah the fuel crisis as well</u>
<u n="291" who="S0115">well we just had  we just had  the panic didn't we so uh panic panic buying</u>
<u n="292" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I liked it that like other things were jumping on the band wagon and saying like oh panic buy beer and like <vocal desc="laugh"/> panic buy you know shoes or whatever</u>
<u n="293" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean that was  that was  cos they thought it was gonna be a strike which was never confirmed um but uh that's</u>
<u n="294" who="S0037" trans="overlap">has there even been a strike like they</u>
<u n="295" who="S0115">no no there <trunc>wa</trunc> there wasn't but there was</u>
<u n="296" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I'm sure they were just trying to get some extra revenue in before the end of the tax year</u>

<u n="298" who="S0037">hadn't struck? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="299" who="S0115">they they they <trunc>so</trunc> he sort of wanted I suppose he wanted to attack them before they'd  before they'd  <trunc>e</trunc> actually before they thought of starting the strike um yeah perhaps to scare them out of starting the strike</u>
<u n="300" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="301" who="S0115">which which worked in that way but but it also meant that there was massive like panic and and uh one person did die actually so there was one uh</u>
<u n="302" who="S0037">oh was that the woman who was <trunc>de</trunc> decanting that? In her next to her gas cooker or something?</u>

<u n="318" who="S0037" trans="overlap">bit of natural selection there I think</u>

<u n="320" who="S0037">well</u>
<u n="321" who="S0115">then then you you you you may make a mistake like because cos they're not normally  they're not normally  doing that are they?</u>

<u n="323" who="S0115">you don't normally handle fuel in the house do you so?</u>

<u n="352" who="S0037">well I don't know</u>
<u n="353" who="S0115">yeah uh I suppose like that that's the most efficient that you know with the with um <trunc>reserv</trunc> <trunc>r</trunc> reservoirs presumably you have to store water in a reservoir you can't store it in in in some way to prevent it from evaporating</u>
<u n="354" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I don't think plants like sea water that much <pause dur="short"/> in the sea? <vocal desc="laugh"/> Don't know</u>
<u n="355" who="S0115">I guess</u>
<u n="356" who="S0037">well</u>
<u n="357" who="S0115">A <trunc>l</trunc> a lidded reservoir?</u>
<u n="358" who="S0037">no I suppose it always does evaporate <pause dur="short"/> it would be quite a big lid for the reservoir</u>
<u n="359" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="360" who="S0037">so</u>
<u n="361" who="S0115">but it's just is it's just not <pause dur="short"/> perhaps that that possibility's there isn't you know it would be too expensive to uh</u>
<u n="362" who="S0037">put a lid on the reservoir? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="363" who="S0115">to <trunc>l</trunc> to lid the reservoir</u>
<u n="364" who="S0037">I think it most definitely would be <pause dur="short"/> they could store it underground maybe</u>
<u n="365" who="S0115" trans="overlap">depends what you lid it with though doesn't it?</u>
<u n="366" who="S0037">could store it underground</u>
<u n="367" who="S0115">yeah I mean presumably there's some reason why they <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>b</trunc> because they collect the rainwater but um <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="368" who="S0037">I dunno</u>
<u n="369" who="S0115">I suppose there could  there could  be able a method of of trying to keep <unclear/></u>
<u n="370" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but you're right it's rained all day today</u>
<u n="371" who="S0115">Cos cos it's it seems that the volume is there you I mean</u>
<u n="372" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="373" who="S0115">somehow anyway</u>
<u n="374" who="S0037">but I bet they'll still water the grass at King's and all that <pause dur="short"/> they'll just pay it won't they?</u>
<u n="375" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> I don't know uh they they they would be pretty exempt I imagine cos they're a public um institution or something</u>
<u n="376" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> is it just private homes then?</u>
<u n="377" who="S0115">guess so yeah <pause dur="short"/> I imagine you could get round it if you if you're a public institution <pause dur="short"/> no that's never well it used to be hosepipe like um</u>
<u n="378" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="379" who="S0115"><trunc>Th</trunc> they always used to have those things but but um uh it it's pretty wasteful I suppose innit all the getting a hosepipe and just like sort of letting it  letting it  run</u>
<u n="380" who="S0037" trans="overlap">squirting it around? Yeah I suppose it is but <pause dur="short"/> if you're growing stuff like we're growing vegetables I mean I'm not gonna be like letting them dry out am I?</u>
<u n="381" who="S0115"><vocal desc="laugh"/> well part of it they'd have to prove  they'd have to prove  that you  that you  watered your garden or something they'd have to come round and I mean sort of</u>
<u n="382" who="S0037" trans="overlap">look at your garden? Yeah <pause dur="short"/> see if it's wilting? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="383" who="S0115">and then um <pause dur="short"/> you could  you could  be framed though someone could uh</u>
<u n="384" who="S0037">ah and like neighbours taking pictures of you? Like the uh Stasi?</u>
<u n="385" who="S0115" trans="overlap">get get a hose hose pipe and sort of spray <pause dur="short"/> like could get their hose pipe and spray it on your garden then <unclear/> like</u>
<u n="386" who="S0037" trans="overlap">then you can <pause dur="short"/> like remember</u>
<u n="387" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well that that's like one of those  one of those  stupid petty garden wars where</u>
<u n="388" who="S0037">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="389" who="S0115">where neighbours chop each others' trees down</u>
<u n="390" who="S0037">that's right yeah <pause dur="short"/> or argue over like spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on legal costs about like like land the size of like a stamp or something</u>
<u n="391" who="S0115" trans="overlap">like border border <pause dur="short"/> that happens quite a lot I think you know when <pause dur="short"/> having worked in litigation there are a lot of cases you know the fees are enormous like</u>
<u n="392" who="S0037" trans="overlap">why do people do it? People've just got more money than sense haven't they?</u>
<u n="393" who="S0115">well yeah basically I think that's that's mainly um but they're also just <pause dur="short"/> some people are just genuinely bad people so you have to do something to <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="394" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah but if it was like a tiny strip of land then you would just be like d'you know what? Have it like</u>
<u n="395" who="S0115">well I mm <pause dur="short"/> I it's not  it's not  been something that <pause dur="short"/> well some that I ever really thought of <pause dur="short"/> but you've got a kind of neighbour that decides to sort of rebuid a fence and then sort of you know put his fence sort of</u>
<u n="396" who="S0037">yeah right on your bit</u>
<u n="397" who="S0115">like a a metre further in?</u>
<u n="398" who="S0037">they did that to me nana like me nana used to um have</u>
<u n="399" who="S0115">I think it's just bad people isn't it?</u>
<u n="400" who="S0037">me nana had daffodils</u>
<u n="401" who="S0115">person who's always got to</u>
<u n="402" who="S0037">had all these tulips and daffodils a massive big load of them against against that fence in her old garden where we where she used to live <pause dur="short"/> and the council came and replaced the fence <pause dur="short"/> um cos the <trunc>h</trunc> her neighbours were horrible</u>
<u n="403" who="S0115">yeah I know yeah I remember you saying</u>
<u n="404" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and they replaced the fence cos um when it was me <trunc>n</trunc> Marge used to live next door they had a lower fence cos they would chat over it but they got it she had it replaced when these horrible neighbours came and had like a high one</u>
<u n="405" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="406" who="S0037">so then they moved it though and like <trunc>w</trunc> she lost all of her flowers <pause dur="short"/> they all went on the other side of the fence <pause dur="short"/> they moved it over like by</u>
<u n="407" who="S0115" trans="overlap">how <trunc>di</trunc>? Who who moved it?</u>
<u n="408" who="S0037">the council moved the fence by about you know</u>
<u n="409" who="S0115">but how? I mean that can't just happen can it or was there some corruption or something?</u>
<u n="410" who="S0037">dunno just by mistake I think <pause dur="short"/> not on purpose</u>
<u n="411" who="S0115">so she <trunc>w</trunc> she wasn't there to see <pause dur="short"/> see it happening?</u>
