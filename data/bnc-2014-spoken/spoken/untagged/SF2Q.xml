<u n="276" who="S0008">no</u>
<u n="277" who="S0012">he said no won't it?</u>

<u n="280" who="S0008">no no no no no no <pause dur="short"/> oh <trunc>unle</trunc> no they might have been talking about private pensions</u>
<u n="281" who="S0012">oh right yours is a private pension isn't it?</u>
<u n="282" who="S0008" trans="overlap">not state pensions</u>
<u n="283" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="284" who="S0008">see it's it's the thing is about private pensions right?</u>
<u n="285" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="286" who="S0008">is that your state pension uses up not all your personal allowance but most of it</u>
<u n="287" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="288" who="S0008">so anything you get on top of that is taxed</u>
<u n="289" who="S0012">taxed yeah</u>
<u n="290" who="S0008">at twenty percent</u>
<u n="291" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="292" who="S0008">so what they're saying is that instead of them paying you</u>
<u n="293" who="S0012">oh I see</u>
<u n="294" who="S0008">but I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s paying</u>

<u n="296" who="S0008" trans="overlap">I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s bro pays his taxes is taxes at source?</u>
<u n="297" who="S0012">is it? Yeah</u>
<u n="298" who="S0008">yes it is <pause dur="short"/> yeah definitely</u>
<u n="299" who="S0013">ours wasn't</u>
<u n="300" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="301" who="S0013">Cos we <trunc>did</trunc> we didn't have much anyway</u>
<u n="302" who="S0012">no we didn't no</u>
<u n="303" who="S0013">but we took it lump sum and then</u>
<u n="304" who="S0012">and lost a thousand pounds</u>
<u n="305" who="S0013">then got a yeah</u>
<u n="306" who="S0008">yeah um <pause dur="short"/> you should ask for advice</u>
<u n="307" who="S0012" trans="overlap">I should have asked for advice <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="308" who="S0008">when you're meddling within you don't have to go out <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="309" who="S0012">well that's true <pause dur="short"/> we should have asked our money guru here</u>
<u n="310" who="S0013">we should have done yeah</u>
<u n="311" who="S0008">but the um yeah I mean <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he pays tax on his pension but it doesn't matter at the moment because he'll have to pay tax anyway</u>
<u n="312" who="S0013">but I'm not sure if it's taken away first isn't it?</u>
<u n="313" who="S0008">well</u>
<u n="314" who="S0013">then you don't know how much you can take</u>
<u n="315" who="S0008">well that's right I mean the thing is</u>
<u n="316" who="S0013">you might as well if you</u>
<u n="317" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="318" who="S0013">they give you a horrible bills</u>
<u n="319" who="S0008">yeah that's right but you see there's this thing that most people don't want to do a tax return do they?</u>
<u n="320" who="S0012">no they don't <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="321" who="S0008">but theoretically if you've got a state pension and a private pension you really should do a tax return</u>
<u n="322" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="323" who="S0008">because there's all sorts of you know things that you could get money back</u>
<u n="324" who="S0012">money back for</u>
<u n="325" who="S0008">and uh cos you forever reading the fact that um you know these people these pension companies that are getting your codes wrong you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="326" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="328" who="S0012">so they're taking off a lot more than they should be doing</u>
<u n="329" who="S0012">true</u>
<u n="330" who="S0008">and stuff like this and people never bother to at the end of the year you know</u>
<u n="331" who="S0012">check up on them</u>
<u n="332" who="S0008">just check up <pause dur="short"/> they just you know happy for what they can get</u>
<u n="333" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="334" who="S0008">whereas in fact if you did a tax return you know you get exactly</u>
<u n="335" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="336" who="S0008">you know everything comes out in the wash <pause dur="short"/> yeah doesn't it?</u>
<u n="337" who="S0012">that's right</u>
<u n="338" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0008">you know I mean whether you paid too much or whatever or who paid what and blah blah blah it all comes out in the wash you know</u>
<u n="340" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="341" who="S0008">yeah it sorts itself out</u>
<u n="342" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="343" who="S0012">but I I <trunc>do</trunc> <trunc>thi</trunc> this government is just ripping people off they all</u>
<u n="344" who="S0013">they couldn't possibly tax your state pension cos you're under the earnings anyway aren't you since</u>
<u n="345" who="S0008">no it's well outside</u>
<u n="346" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="348" who="S0008">that's right you under the earning</u>
<u n="349" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0012">but if you did earn would they take it off at the source then? If you</u>
<u n="351" who="S0008">and if you were working</u>
<u n="352" who="S0013">but no it would be taken off your work</u>
<u n="353" who="S0008">if you it would be taken off your work</u>
<u n="354" who="S0012">yeah but if you're self-employed you'd send a tax form in wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="355" who="S0008">you'd have to</u>
<u n="356" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="357" who="S0008">ah but if you worked and drew your pension that in that case it should be taxed at source</u>
<u n="358" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="359" who="S0008">couldn't</u>
<u n="360" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="361" who="S0008">you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="362" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="363" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="364" who="S0008">because you got your tax allowance on your</u>
<u n="365" who="S0012">on your</u>
<u n="366" who="S0008">on your PAYE on where you're working</u>
<u n="367" who="S0012">that's right <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="368" who="S0008">and then comes in extra doesn't it?</u>
<u n="369" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="370" who="S0008">so it should be taxed at source</u>
<u n="371" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="372" who="S0008">but I mean  I mean  how many people</u>
<u n="373" who="S0013">you're allowed to earn</u>
<u n="374" who="S0008">does that affect?</u>
<u n="375" who="S0013">like four thousand aren't you? Including your pension something like that</u>
<u n="376" who="S0008">when you're at the moment when you're sixty-five your tax code is something like nine five something</u>
<u n="377" who="S0012">mm hm</u>
<u n="378" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="379" who="S0008">which means you can earn nine thousand quid</u>
<u n="380" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="381" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="382" who="S0008">and your pension is what? Seven thousand or something like that?</u>
<u n="383" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="384" who="S0008">for an individual</u>
<u n="385" who="S0013">that's including that isn't it?</u>
<u n="386" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="387" who="S0008">right <pause dur="short"/> so you're allowed to you earn another couple of thousand a year</u>
<u n="388" who="S0012">before you hit tax</u>
<u n="389" who="S0008">before you even start paying tax</u>
<u n="390" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="391" who="S0008">but that was the other thing is they were saying that that at the moment you know when you're sixty-five you know because before your personal allowance was six thousand seven hundred</u>
<u n="392" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="393" who="S0008">and when you're sixty-five it was nine thousand right?</u>
<u n="394" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="395" who="S0008">you know to allow for that thing</u>
<u n="396" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="397" who="S0008">you know that you keep more of your money</u>
<u n="398" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="399" who="S0008">but now the personal taxing is eight thousand six hundred but they haven't put up the nine thousand whatever it was for</u>
<u n="400" who="S0012">for the pension</u>
<u n="401" who="S0008">for the pensioners</u>
<u n="402" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="403" who="S0008">so a lot of pensioners are saying oh you know we're losing out <pause dur="short"/> we're losing more and uh no you're not losing out because you're just not gaining</u>
<u n="404" who="S0012">no you're not gaining</u>
<u n="405" who="S0008">you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="406" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="407" who="S0008">then all these arguments our pension is losing out it means they're not really losing out they're not just gaining as much as they had in the past</u>
<u n="408" who="S0012">no that's right</u>
<u n="409" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="410" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="411" who="S0008">and you know</u>
<u n="412" who="S0012">all these</u>
<u n="413" who="S0008">it is</u>
<u n="414" who="S0012">ways are all these ways that you can what what they don't call fiddling tax but evading tax is it</u>
<u n="415" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="416" who="S0012">is it <trunc>eva</trunc> tax evasion or tax?</u>
<u n="417" who="S0008">well there's what arethe two terms <pause dur="short"/> one is to one is</u>
<u n="418" who="S0012">tax evasion</u>
<u n="419" who="S0008">evasion and one is</u>
<u n="420" who="S0012">tax avoidance <pause dur="short"/> avoid</u>
<u n="421" who="S0008">avoidance <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I don't know anyway but one is legal and one isn't?</u>
<u n="422" who="S0012">one is legal and one is yeah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0008">Cos it is a it's a basic rule with anything with uh tax or anything like that <pause dur="short"/> if you can find a loophole which means you don't have to pay</u>
<u n="424" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="425" who="S0008">then you're quite within your rights to use it</u>
<u n="426" who="S0012">of course you are yeah</u>
<u n="427" who="S0008">you know and that's until they close the loophole of course</u>
<u n="428" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="429" who="S0008">which is what's happening <pause dur="short"/> and I'm sure that in the past the tax system has been devised to tax the poor people</u>
<u n="430" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="431" who="S0008">and to not tax the rich people</u>
<u n="432" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="433" who="S0008">or not as much</u>
<u n="434" who="S0013">yes</u>
<u n="435" who="S0008">but nowadays you see you're getting more and more people jumping over from being poor to being rich</u>
<u n="436" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="437" who="S0008">and these people are exploiting every loophole they can find</u>
<u n="438" who="S0012">they can get <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="439" who="S0008">and other people are then seeing it and they are trying it as well <pause dur="short"/> so in fact the tax loss is getting bigger and bigger</u>
<u n="440" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="441" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="442" who="S0008">did you see that Amazon</u>
<u n="443" who="S0012">yes</u>
<u n="444" who="S0008">paid something like three million tax in three years or something like that <pause dur="short"/> corporation tax</u>
<u n="445" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="446" who="S0008">after making a billion a year or something</u>
<u n="447" who="S0012">A billion a year yeah</u>
<u n="448" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="449" who="S0008">Cos they're registered in Luxembourg</u>
<u n="450" who="S0013">ah I see</u>
<u n="451" who="S0008">then they've got an office in Luxembourg with about a hundred and fifty people in it</u>
<u n="452" who="S0013">ah</u>
<u n="453" who="S0008">and all the money goes there</u>
<u n="454" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="455" who="S0008">and so it's not</u>
<u n="456" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="457" who="S0008">but I mean on the other hand they do employ thousands of people in this company</u>
<u n="458" who="S0012">oh yeah that is a point</u>
<u n="459" who="S0008">they're paying PAYE</u>
<u n="460" who="S0012">but <trunc>y</trunc></u>
<u n="461" who="S0008" trans="overlap">and all them drivers as well packers and drivers and</u>
<u n="462" who="S0012">yeah and there's lots of companies</u>
<u n="463" who="S0008">and they putting a lot of people out of business you know</u>
<u n="464" who="S0012" trans="overlap">lots of companies registered with in Ireland as well</u>
<u n="465" who="S0008">Ireland that's Microsoft oh no Apple</u>
<u n="466" who="S0012">apple yeah</u>
<u n="467" who="S0008">apple are registered in Ireland</u>
<u n="468" who="S0012">and Sony</u>
<u n="469" who="S0008">that's right yeah cos they only pay ten per cent taxes out of the twenty-six per cent</u>
<u n="470" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="471" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="472" who="S0008">but this is one of these things like when Ireland was well is sort of basically bankrupt but that's only half the story because these other big companies which officially have got massive exports</u>
<u n="473" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="474" who="S0008">from Ireland</u>
<u n="475" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="476" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="477" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="478" who="S0008">but it's always a global citizen it's getting  it's getting  um so that countries don't actually mean much any more</u>
<u n="479" who="S0012">that's right</u>
<u n="480" who="S0008">when it comes to finance <pause dur="short"/> the only way they can get money is through VAT and PAYE</u>
<u n="481" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="482" who="S0008">really</u>
<u n="483" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's right</u>
<u n="484" who="S0008">and that's why VAT keeps going up</u>
<u n="485" who="S0012">twenty per cent</u>
<u n="486" who="S0008">because you know you can't avoid paying that there's no well</u>
<u n="487" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="488" who="S0008">you can if you're a foreigner <pause dur="short"/> cos you can claim it back can't you?</u>
<u n="489" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you can claim VAT back if you're  if you're  self-employed and you're registered with VAT</u>
<u n="490" who="S0008">yeah that as well but I mean that's a business thing but maybe</u>
<u n="491" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="492" who="S0008">if you go to the West End and buy anything and show them your passport your foreign passport</u>
<u n="493" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="494" who="S0008">you can get it VAT free</u>

<u n="496" who="S0013">no</u>
<u n="497" who="S0008">but you see it's but then when you go out into your country</u>
<u n="498" who="S0013">mm</u>
