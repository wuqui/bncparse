<u n="616" who="S0287" trans="overlap">how? how does a circular kitchen roll work?</u>
<u n="617" who="S0282">well you have you have a round thing <pause dur="short"/> with a cone in it <pause dur="short"/> and you fold your circular kitchen rolls into a cone <pause dur="short"/> and then you stack them up <pause dur="short"/> so you've got two hundred separate kitchen rolls circular ones in a cone <pause dur="short"/> and then it's got a little <unclear>grasp</unclear></u>
<u n="618" who="S0287" trans="overlap">but they won't be in a cone will they? they'll be in a they'll be in like a stack of pancakes they can't be like a cone</u>
<u n="619" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no no cos they're in a cone</u>
<u n="620" who="S0287">they can't be in a cone how can they be in a? <trunc>c</trunc> if they're circular they can't be on a cone there'd have to be a fold</u>
<u n="621" who="S0282" trans="overlap">and they've got <pause dur="short"/> they they are folded yes they're kind of there's an origami thing so <trunc>th</trunc> you have a circular thing and then somebody takes a <trunc>c</trunc> a triangular fold <pause dur="short"/> and then puts it on this stand so it's in a cone and you have a little plastic</u>
<u n="622" who="S0287">so is there <trunc>s</trunc> a lot of witches hats on top of each other?</u>
<u n="623" who="S0282">yes yes</u>
<u n="624" who="S0287">okay</u>
<u n="625" who="S0282">yes two hundred witch hats on top of each other with a little plastic cone on top to keep them in place <pause dur="short"/> so then you take the plastic cone off and you pinch out <pause dur="short"/> your kitchen roll</u>
<u n="626" who="S0287">like a box of tissues</u>
<u n="627" who="S0282" trans="overlap">and then you unfold it and it's yes and it's circular <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="628" who="S0287" trans="overlap">what's the? what is the advantage of it being circular?</u>
<u n="629" who="S0282" trans="overlap">ah you can transport twenty percent more kitchen rolls in the same</u>
<u n="630" who="S0288">space</u>
<u n="631" who="S0282">in the same space on the lorry</u>
<u n="632" who="S0288">oh</u>
<u n="633" who="S0282">so it's</u>
<u n="634" who="S0288">good</u>
<u n="635" who="S0282">really good for the environment</u>
<u n="636" who="S0288">it's like</u>
<u n="637" who="S0287">what? but it circular is no way better than square</u>
<u n="638" who="S0288" trans="overlap">it's like</u>
<u n="639" who="S0287">when you're transporting things</u>
<u n="640" who="S0282">yes it is</u>
<u n="641" who="S0288"><unclear>so it goes right to the end really kinda like</unclear></u>
<u n="642" who="S0287" trans="overlap">how can it be?</u>
<u n="643" who="S0282" trans="overlap">because the packs are</u>
<u n="644" who="S0287">cos you fill all the corners if it's square and you can't fill all the corners if it's circular</u>
<u n="645" who="S0282">no because it comes like this it's wrapped so they're all round</u>
<u n="646" who="S0288" trans="overlap"><unclear>what it is more</unclear> boxes</u>
<u n="647" who="S0282">so they all</u>
<u n="648" who="S0288">mm</u>
<u n="649" who="S0282">squash up together</u>
<u n="650" who="S0287">but they don't all squash up together you're still gonna have spaces in between</u>
<u n="651" who="S0288" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah they're probably smaller spaces though it's like wrapping Kit Kats on the on the <unclear>out</unclear></u>
<u n="652" who="S0282" trans="overlap">apparently you can</u>
<u n="653" who="S0288">it's</u>

<u n="656" who="S0282">Kit Kats?</u>
<u n="657" who="S0288" trans="overlap">you know they changed the way they did KitKats instead of <trunc>d</trunc> cos they used to just do them square and them somebody said well if you do it <trunc>s</trunc> on a slant you can use less silvery paper <pause dur="short"/> and they saved a humongous amount of money</u>
<u n="658" who="S0287" trans="overlap">I'm not sure it's true <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> well I don't know how it is true</u>

<u n="660" who="S0287">the paper</u>
<u n="661" who="S0288">on the paper</u>
<u n="662" who="S0282">ah</u>
<u n="663" who="S0287">yeah so instead of having a bit of paper that shape and the Kit Kat square like that they turned it</u>
<u n="664" who="S0288" trans="overlap">in the middle</u>
<u n="665" who="S0287">it turned at an angle</u>
<u n="666" who="S0282">ah</u>
<u n="667" who="S0288" trans="overlap">you turn at an angle and you can do it with smaller</u>

<u n="669" who="S0288">with less</u>
<u n="670" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="671" who="S0288">paper</u>
<u n="672" who="S0282">although the reason I won't buy Munchies from the shop</u>
<u n="673" who="S0288" trans="overlap"><unclear>it's like something I'd do</unclear></u>
<u n="674" who="S0282">is because they're always unwrapped at the end so they've always been exposed and you think mm who's been touching those? so you have to be careful with things like <unclear>wrapping</unclear></u>
<u n="675" who="S0287">isn't that the same with</u>
<u n="676" who="S0288" trans="overlap">eat the eat the Munchies</u>

<u n="684" who="S0287">well that's not the point though is it? it's <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's it's the tube shape with <vocal desc="laugh"/> the foil on the end</u>
<u n="685" who="S0282">well apparently apparently according to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> it is twenty percent more efficient <pause dur="short"/> to have circular kitchen rolls and they are quite neat you have this thing and it's sitting there and you take the little lid off and you go oh and you pick your kitchen roll out <pause dur="short"/> and then you've got a circular kitchen roll</u>
<u n="686" who="S0287">are they they're the paper ones that absorb liquid aren't they?</u>
