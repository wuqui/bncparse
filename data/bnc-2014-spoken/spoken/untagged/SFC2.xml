<u n="1" who="S0631">I dunno</u>
<u n="2" who="S0632">so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> managed to cure his vegetarianism <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3" who="S0631">okay</u>
<u n="4" who="S0632">but</u>
<u n="5" who="S0635" trans="overlap">but I</u>
<u n="6" who="S0632">why why did <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> decide to eat meat?</u>
<u n="7" who="S0635">well cos he wasn't doing it for ethical reasons he was just raised as a vegetarian and he <trunc>fe</trunc>felt that he would be intolerant to meat if he ate it and he just and he's always been quite poor as well I think so</u>
<u n="8" who="S0631" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="9" who="S0635">he just avoided meat and then he was like oh I have no ethical objections and I'd like to try it so he made himself do it</u>
<u n="10" who="S0631">interesting <pause dur="short"/> I've known someone I went to uni with someone once who erm <pause dur="short"/> who was brought up a vegetarian but she <pause dur="short"/> she does eat meat but she mainly just has fish cos she really likes it <pause dur="short"/> that's a story isn't it?</u>
<u n="11" who="S0632">yeah I really like fish like a lot and</u>
<u n="12" who="S0631">even the wiggly ones as well</u>
<u n="13" who="S0632">I like the idea of being a vegetarian <pause dur="short"/> and I'm not sure how I feel about the lab meat</u>
<u n="14" who="S0635">why?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0632">I'd try it but I really sincerely doubt that they're gonna get a fish texture right</u>
<u n="16" who="S0635">well but it would be like biologically identical</u>
<u n="17" who="S0631">how would they do it though? would there be some sort of element of <pause dur="short"/> cruelty <pause dur="short"/> involved initially?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0635">what?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0632">would the lab meat have a face? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0631">no</u>
<u n="21" who="S0635" trans="overlap">no no I think they just you could just grow like a rump steak</u>
<u n="22" who="S0631">but they're not gonna grow it from nothing so where has that come from? <pause dur="short"/> so where's that that process that</u>
<u n="23" who="S0635">they'll copy one I don't know</u>
<u n="24" who="S0632"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="25" who="S0631">cos</u>
<u n="26" who="S0635">I mean we know we already know like <pause dur="short"/> the you know genetic makeup of a cow rump no doubt <pause dur="short"/> just</u>
<u n="27" who="S0631" trans="overlap">yeah but would you not have had to have a cow in the first place and done something with that cow? <pause dur="short"/> and would that not have</u>
<u n="28" who="S0635" trans="overlap">yeah but it's probably already done and it's for the good of like the future like you kill one cow so that they can all go free again and run around the cities</u>
<u n="29" who="S0631">the cities</u>
<u n="30" who="S0632"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="31" who="S0635">you know and go shopping</u>
<u n="32" who="S0631" trans="overlap">I don't know it seems a bit too hypothetical for me to say cos I wouldn't be able to I wouldn't have I haven't got the facts do you know what I mean? they haven't done it so I haven't got the facts so</u>
<u n="33" who="S0635" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="34" who="S0631">I can't make</u>
<u n="35" who="S0632" trans="overlap">so you can't hypothetically decide whether or not you'll eat</u>
<u n="36" who="S0631" trans="overlap">I can't make an informed decision of whether I would or wouldn't</u>
<u n="37" who="S0632" trans="overlap">as in a <pause dur="short"/> yeah as a as a vegetarian you can't hypothetically decide whether you'd eat lab meat until</u>
<u n="38" who="S0635">would you eat it if it was grown on the back of a mouse?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0631">no</u>
<u n="40" who="S0632"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0631">of course I wouldn't</u>
<u n="42" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="43" who="S0631">no <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>because they do that</unclear> with ears and in GCSE English I read the article and cried</u>
<u n="44" who="S0632">oh yeah I think I remember that</u>
<u n="45" who="S0631">I just thought I'm not doing it I'm not coping I can't cope with this</u>
<u n="46" who="S0632">it's too sad</u>
<u n="47" who="S0635">yeah you're actually right I</u>
<u n="48" who="S0631" trans="overlap">then this <unclear>mouse</unclear></u>
<u n="49" who="S0635">because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I were talking about where do vitamins come from like in vitamin tablets?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0631">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0635">and it's <unclear/> and yeah obviously it wouldn't be necessarily be directly harming animals but really <unclear/></u>
<u n="52" who="S0631" trans="overlap">would they be exploiting you know?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0635" trans="overlap">nothing comes from nowhere yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0632">you can't just pluck the vitamins out of the air</u>
<u n="55" who="S0635" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="56" who="S0632">they have to come from somewhere</u>
<u n="57" who="S0631">mm mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0632">because they've got to be extracted or created somehow</u>
<u n="59" who="S0635" trans="overlap">but it hasn't been done yet people think they're close but it hasn't been done</u>
<u n="60" who="S0631" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="61" who="S0635">so yes you'd have to</u>
<u n="62" who="S0631">anywhere though that an <trunc>an</trunc>animal is a commodity there is cruelty so if that was lab meat but animals are still being used in some way as the initial process is probably cruelty cos they just don't tend to get</u>
<u n="63" who="S0632">that makes sense cos that's a similar argument to the one about marginalised and oppressed people cos like if there's a motivation to oppress someone to extract labour and erm</u>
<u n="64" who="S0631" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0632">services from them and then yeah then you <trunc>c</trunc> nothing's simple you can't just sweep it aside as no it doesn't exist</u>
<u n="66" who="S0631" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="67" who="S0632">so yeah there's a motivation there to <trunc>o</trunc>oppress <unclear>entire</unclear></u>
<u n="68" who="S0631" trans="overlap">and like behind everything as well where you think you're gonna be doing something like for the right reasons but then somebody like is probably you know like if you buy something and you think you're doing that for the right reasons there's probably some sort of like some child might have <unclear/> do you know what I mean? it's always something <unclear>something bad from that</unclear></u>
<u n="69" who="S0632" trans="overlap">there's always something like and that's the thing about the palm oil as well so you think you're eating clean and doing your best and buying seasonal food and it's like yeah but my peanut butter has palm oil which is really harmful to the environment</u>
<u n="70" who="S0631" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="71" who="S0632">and everything's just buggered up</u>
<u n="72" who="S0631">I know I <trunc>ever</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0632">buggered</u>
<u n="74" who="S0631">buggered <unclear/></u>
<u n="75" who="S0635" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0632"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0635"><unclear/></u>
<u n="78" who="S0632" trans="overlap">lots of times</u>
<u n="79" who="S0631">no it's nice <unclear/></u>
<u n="80" who="S0632">mm?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0631"><unclear/></u>
<u n="82" who="S0632">yeah go for it please do</u>
<u n="83" who="S0631">thanks I will I will</u>
<u n="84" who="S0632">you can move on up to the higher <pause dur="short"/> potato run <pause dur="short"/> potato mobility</u>
<u n="85" who="S0631">there's a very limited bit of you know on it <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="86" who="S0632">rosemary?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0631">yes</u>
<u n="88" who="S0632" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0631">rosemary</u>
<u n="90" who="S0632">are you looking for a scoop?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0632">or a way to</u>
<u n="93" who="S0635">I would like something <pause dur="short"/> to extract all the vegetables</u>
<u n="94" who="S0632">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> I like the idea of eating very little meat <pause dur="short"/> I really love molluscs and they can't and no one else even likes them why can't I have them? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="95" who="S0635">I I doubt they're the worst I mean</u>
<u n="96" who="S0632" trans="overlap">do you think should I investigate whether the fishing practices that get molluscs are harmful to the environment?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0635">yes I also think just reducing the amount you would eat would be doing a favour to the animals in some ways</u>
<u n="98" who="S0631">but you should also look at erm who was involved with the farming industry problem <pause dur="short"/> okay? there might be</u>
<u n="99" who="S0635">and different countries will have different <pause dur="short"/> policies</u>
<u n="100" who="S0631" trans="overlap">there might be people getting <unclear/> wage</u>
<u n="101" who="S0632">yes</u>
<u n="102" who="S0631">there might be people <unclear>treated badly</unclear></u>
<u n="103" who="S0635">mm mm but that's almost in everything and once you really get down to it</u>
<u n="104" who="S0631" trans="overlap">exactly</u>
<u n="105" who="S0635">like you you basically</u>
<u n="106" who="S0632" trans="overlap">it's terrifying</u>
<u n="107" who="S0635">stop eating</u>
<u n="108" who="S0631" trans="overlap">so that's probably so that's why I was a bit like well I couldn't commit myself to this erm</u>
<u n="109" who="S0635" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="110" who="S0631">lab meat thing cos there'll be cruelty somewhere</u>
<u n="111" who="S0635" trans="overlap">yeah and <trunc>i</trunc></u>
<u n="112" who="S0631" trans="overlap">cos there's cruelty in everything there's probably cruelty in this potato</u>
<u n="113" who="S0632">cruel-free parsnips</u>
<u n="114" who="S0635">and if you eat things that are only grown or made locally it's very expensive</u>
<u n="115" who="S0631" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> mm mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0635">you know erm you know if if I had all the money in the world it would be very nice</u>
<u n="117" who="S0631">I know</u>
<u n="118" who="S0635">but that isn't <unclear/></u>
<u n="119" who="S0632" trans="overlap">well we'll need to make our house a smallholding</u>

<u n="124" who="S0631">well that would be good <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> would really like that</u>
<u n="125" who="S0632"><vocal desc="laugh"/> she can be the farm cat</u>
<u n="126" who="S0635">yeah or the neighbourhood cat</u>
<u n="127" who="S0631">to be honest she probably wouldn't know what to do with a chicken</u>
<u n="128" who="S0632">well we've got foxes too but they only eat jam sandwiches <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="129" who="S0635">oh yeah</u>

<u n="134" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0632">unfortunately</u>
<u n="136" who="S0635">if you're ever at the sink keep an eye out out of the window</u>
<u n="137" who="S0632">it's a good fox watching spot the sink</u>
<u n="138" who="S0635">mm mm</u>
<u n="139" who="S0631">okay <pause dur="short"/> I will <pause dur="short"/> would you <pause dur="short"/> work in a an abattoir?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0635">yeah I mean well</u>
<u n="141" who="S0631">you would?</u>

<u n="146" who="S0632" trans="overlap">I've never been to one</u>
<u n="147" who="S0635">but yeah maybe it would change my mind I don't know I feel like if I'm gonna eat meat then I should</u>
<u n="148" who="S0631">yeah but that's what my counter-argument is that you couldn't you probably shouldn't</u>
<u n="149" who="S0635">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0632" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0635">I I think I probably could but</u>
<u n="152" who="S0632">my my erm argument about being able to eat meat does often stem from the fact that I you know plucked and gutted birds that I saw alive only a few seconds earlier and I never pulled the trigger myself <pause dur="short"/> and and just</u>
<u n="153" who="S0631" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="154" who="S0632">just birds as well nothing else but like so the idea of like killing a pig or a cow or something <pause dur="short"/> bigger and <pause dur="short"/> that's loud thank you</u>
<u n="155" who="S0631" trans="overlap">well I kind of erm <pause dur="short"/> you know my argument is though like if you're not like I think it would be fine if everyone hunted their own animals that would be fair game but the</u>

<u n="164" who="S0631" trans="overlap"><unclear/> a bit like if you're prepared to put up with that and like would you be prepared to watch it whatever?</u>
<u n="165" who="S0632">it's it's a really I mean you're so right that me gutting and plucking a pheasant is not the same as me eating a factory-farmed chicken or cow or pig</u>
<u n="166" who="S0631">yeah it's <unclear/></u>
<u n="167" who="S0632" trans="overlap">it's not the same thing</u>
<u n="168" who="S0631">and if it was your like your hunt like kind of instinctively you did that because you were hungry and blah blah blah blah blah yeah do it</u>
<u n="169" who="S0635">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0632">yeah yeah and that's like</u>

<u n="181" who="S0631">yeah</u>
<u n="182" who="S0632">which is just like nature is you know <vocal desc="laugh"/> and it and it is much closer to being part of nature than <pause dur="short"/> buying food from an abattoir it's not the same</u>
<u n="183" who="S0631">no</u>
