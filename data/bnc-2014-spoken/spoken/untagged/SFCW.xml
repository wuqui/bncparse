<u n="12" who="S0264">the first week or two is is quite straightforward cos you just watch a video and they they make sure it's all bite size and you and you click when something is done it gives you a great feeling you've you click through all these things but then it starts getting more demanding</u>
<u n="13" who="S0263" trans="overlap">after a bit yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0264">the problem <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="15" who="S0263" trans="overlap">so what other grievances oh yes oh I had you know the <unclear>Miage</unclear> students?</u>

<u n="20" who="S0264">I do er</u>

<u n="23" who="S0263">yeah and she said I need to speak to you so I said okay so from the email I thought well it's going to be something negative <pause dur="short"/> so I was expecting the worst I had got <trunc>m</trunc> I had got them to do some transcription <vocal desc="laugh"/> do you remember? so I thought it was gonna be about that</u>
<u n="24" who="S0264">oh your transcriptions?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0263">I had got them to do some work on the <unclear>Furasso</unclear> law and things like that</u>
<u n="26" who="S0264">well they agreed</u>
<u n="27" who="S0263">they agreed and they all so they seemed happy enough anyway <pause dur="short"/> and they liked they liked having you they said</u>
<u n="28" who="S0264">oh</u>
<u n="29" who="S0263">and erm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0264" trans="overlap">that's unexpected after the last session</u>
<u n="31" who="S0263"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="32" who="S0264">they nearly</u>
<u n="33" who="S0263">well they were not they weren't great were they? anyway</u>
<u n="34" who="S0264">I thought that it was very French I mean that's what I I told told you when you told me about the riots and how the kids upturned the cars</u>
<u n="35" who="S0263">mm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0264">I thought this I liked this about France they they can say what they feel <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0263">yeah they're very</u>
<u n="38" who="S0264" trans="overlap"><event desc="unintelligible"/> demonstrative</u>
<u n="39" who="S0263">the opposite of what the experience I had here</u>
<u n="40" who="S0264">mm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0263">and the oh <pause dur="long"/> and erm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0264">so you went along</u>
<u n="43" who="S0263">she said yes erm <pause dur="short"/> you've got to change your course you know the students are not happy with it and I was <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>th</trunc>they er they want to do a they want to do more things like CVs and I said oh but we did CVs and we did video CVs</u>
<u n="44" who="S0264" trans="overlap">yeah and why didn't they tell you anyway?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0263">cos I got this CV idea from you the video CV</u>
<u n="46" who="S0264">can't remember</u>
<u n="47" who="S0263" trans="overlap">you film yourself doing sort of presentation well it <trunc>w</trunc> I think it was I don't know</u>
<u n="48" who="S0264">somebody else but</u>
<u n="49" who="S0263" trans="overlap">anyway</u>
<u n="50" who="S0264">a good idea yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0263">I said oh well okay and er <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> then she said well I suppose <pause dur="short"/> I said well <trunc>sh</trunc> I I need some more concrete sort of feedback shall I <trunc>wr</trunc>write to the students and say would you mind giving me some feedback?</u>
<u n="52" who="S0264">mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0263">and then so I sent them that</u>
<u n="54" who="S0264">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0263">and the feedback that I got was absolutely lovely they said we really appreciated it</u>
<u n="56" who="S0264">oh</u>
<u n="57" who="S0263">cos it's not at all their style to sort of say that they like things when they don't</u>
<u n="58" who="S0264">no cos they</u>
<u n="59" who="S0263" trans="overlap">they said</u>
<u n="60" who="S0264" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="61" who="S0263" trans="overlap">we really like doing the workshops</u>
<u n="62" who="S0264">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0263">erm one guy said I don't usually like English but as you let you let us a lot of you let us have a lot of freedom and <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I was happy to you know I thought I thought that's what they needed to not to be sort of mithered too much they been wanted a lot of freedom</u>
<u n="64" who="S0264" trans="overlap">it wouldn't work with them would it?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0263">no</u>
<u n="66" who="S0264">they'd just rebel</u>
<u n="67" who="S0263" trans="overlap">and I got really nice and the last after you left we went to the to the pub with some of them and I gave them all my second hand books that I don't want anymore and they were really touched by that</u>
<u n="68" who="S0264">mm</u>
<u n="69" who="S0263">and they said I'm reading er I'm reading some of the books you gave us and</u>
<u n="70" who="S0264">you mean novels or what?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0263">novels yeah <pause dur="short"/> and the feedback didn't at all correspond to what this woman had said</u>
<u n="72" who="S0264">but did you make this woman read the feedback? did you <trunc>gi</trunc> er send send the feedback to her?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0263">no cos she doesn't read English she doesn't speak English she's always going on about how <trunc>sh</trunc>she doesn't speak a word of English</u>
<u n="74" who="S0264" trans="overlap">well I reckon it would be worth translating that feedback <pause dur="short"/> cos it's so such a contrast isn't it? I</u>
<u n="75" who="S0263">thought so it made me feel pretty low <trunc>al</trunc>already just having a low <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="76" who="S0264">mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0263">end of term and then I got this criticism and I was thinking oh no and then I got the feedback from those students which was really nice which really cheered me up</u>
<u n="78" who="S0264">yeah but it makes you wonder where did she where is she coming from? where does she get this <pause dur="short"/> idea from? it must have been one student on one morning <pause dur="short"/> or maybe she said what don't you like about er <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s course?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0263">and also it was interesting you know when you give feedback you usually say one well the the sort of practice is to say one nice thing and then</u>
<u n="80" who="S0264">one thing for improvement say</u>
<u n="81" who="S0263">and she didn't say she went straight into you know <pause dur="short"/> negative negative negative as if the whole thing had been a <trunc>disa</trunc> and I was thinking well that's not the impression that I got at all</u>
<u n="82" who="S0264">I think you've gotta be quite clever to manage that group because it's a it's quite a large group and they're not linguists they're IT so they don't perceive language to be necessarily the most useful thing for them</u>
<u n="83" who="S0263">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0264">and so if you can manage that <pause dur="short"/> which you have which you did <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="85" who="S0263">so I'm a bit I'm sort of erm a bit fed up with er</u>
<u n="86" who="S0264">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0263"><unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> university</u>
<u n="88" who="S0264">yes <pause dur="short"/> would you like some fruit I've got a whole bag of stuff here?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0263">but I could imagine it's erm the same anywhere</u>
<u n="90" who="S0264">within reason I think that's I think that's true but I</u>
<u n="91" who="S0263" trans="overlap">thank you</u>
<u n="92" who="S0264">I once worked in erm <anon type="place"/> and</u>
<u n="93" who="S0263">thanks</u>
<u n="94" who="S0264"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> but now I was well actually the staff were alright but he was very good because he was very mm what's it called? democratic he he put people into er little committees er with a revolving chairperson and said okay you're in charge you're you this group is in charge of IT procurement or IT development for the department</u>
<u n="95" who="S0263">mm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0264">and so he would delegate decisions <pause dur="short"/> it was quite clever really</u>
<u n="97" who="S0263">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0264">so you felt involved I think</u>
<u n="99" who="S0263">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0264">you felt that it was a kind of more a flatter organisation <pause dur="short"/> rather than having say <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> making all the management decisions <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="101" who="S0263">mm <pause dur="short"/> anyway <pause dur="short"/> and then I've had a horrible shock cos I've seen er the accommodation here and last time it seemed to me that I paid a hundred and something for the week</u>
<u n="102" who="S0264"><anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="103" who="S0263">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0264">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0263">and erm I got a bill for two hundred and eighty a week <vocal desc="laugh"/> the only difference is that I've got a pull out bed that you can pop up <pause dur="short"/> it's the same room</u>
<u n="106" who="S0264">but that's erm you should be paying less not more if it's pull up shouldn't you? more like a studio <pause dur="short"/> than <trunc>bef</trunc></u>
<u n="107" who="S0263" trans="overlap">well I've got one bed and the pull up before it just had</u>
<u n="108" who="S0264">well why don't you ask them to change to er the other room?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0263">well I asked for a sort of family room for</u>
<u n="110" who="S0264">oh that's why</u>
<u n="111" who="S0263">for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to come</u>
<u n="112" who="S0264">that's why</u>
<u n="113" who="S0263">but actually here I'm all on my own</u>
<u n="114" who="S0264">is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> not coming?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0263">he's gone off cycling</u>
<u n="116" who="S0264">where?</u>
<u n="117" who="S0263" trans="overlap">but he'll be coming down then</u>
<u n="118" who="S0264">oh <pause dur="short"/> is he in the UK?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0263">no he he <trunc>wen</trunc> he went back <pause dur="short"/> yesterday he stayed one night here <pause dur="short"/> so I oh I've got eight hundred and something <vocal desc="laugh"/> bill</u>
<u n="120" who="S0264">oh my gosh that's a lot</u>
<u n="121" who="S0263">well three weeks</u>
<u n="122" who="S0264">gosh</u>
<u n="123" who="S0263">erm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0264" trans="overlap">why couldn't you okay why don't you negotiate with them and erm <pause dur="short"/> move into <pause dur="short"/> a small room for two of the weeks? <pause dur="short"/> I mean er when is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> gonna stay with you is that whole time or</u>
<u n="125" who="S0263">next week</u>
<u n="126" who="S0264">for one week or?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0263">every other night <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="128" who="S0264">oh I see you why every other night? that'll <trunc>disor</trunc>disorientate him</u>
<u n="129" who="S0263">because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> works every other day</u>
<u n="130" who="S0264"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> er is his <trunc>d</trunc></u>
<u n="131" who="S0263" trans="overlap">my my brother</u>
<u n="132" who="S0264">oh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I met <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0263">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mum mum is too old to look after him on her own <pause dur="short"/> so she can only</u>
<u n="134" who="S0264" trans="overlap">so that's the deal</u>
<u n="135" who="S0263" trans="overlap">look after him when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> works Monday Friday Wednesday Friday <pause dur="long"/> mm</u>
<u n="136" who="S0264">that's annoying because erm <pause dur="short"/> if you could persuade <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to have <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> for a whole week then</u>
<u n="137" who="S0263">well they are this week</u>
<u n="138" who="S0264">then you could go into a smaller room</u>
<u n="139" who="S0263">mm</u>
<u n="140" who="S0264">save some money and then move back into the family room</u>
<u n="141" who="S0263">mm <pause dur="short"/> there's no difference in the size <pause dur="short"/> it's just</u>
<u n="142" who="S0264" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0263" trans="overlap">but it's got a slide it's you know it's those beds that fit underneath you know?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0264">yeah but they obviously make a well ask them</u>
<u n="145" who="S0263">I will I feel a bit embarrassed cos I got given the bill <vocal desc="laugh"/> sort of stood there and looked at the figure</u>
<u n="146" who="S0264">your jaw dropped</u>
<u n="147" who="S0263">and then I went off</u>
<u n="148" who="S0264"><vocal desc="laugh"/> you probably didn't even take it in did you right at that moment?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0263">I didn't take it in and then I spoke to my mother and she's last <trunc>yes</trunc> this morning and she went <pause dur="short"/> what?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0264" trans="overlap">what?</u>
<u n="151" who="S0263">ah you how are you gonna pay for that? and I was like I don't know she no <vocal desc="laugh"/> she was saying how are <trunc>y</trunc> how are you gonna pay for all these extravagances?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0264">well except it isn't <pause dur="short"/> it isn't such an extravagance is it? it's not like you're staying at I don't know the Holiday Inn or something</u>
<u n="153" who="S0263">well it would be a hundred a night if I was staying in a hotel</u>
<u n="154" who="S0264">mm <pause dur="short"/> and what what is it here? fifty something</u>
<u n="155" who="S0263" trans="overlap">thirty-seven</u>
<u n="156" who="S0264">thirty-seven that's good <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="157" who="S0263">so it's still quite cheap isn't it?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0264">yeah I mean it's cheaper than er <pause dur="short"/> er what do you call that chain? erm not Ibis the other one with the moon the half moon</u>
<u n="159" who="S0263">Holiday Inn?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0264">no but it's one like that</u>
<u n="161" who="S0263"><unclear/>?</u>
<u n="162" who="S0264">similar</u>
<u n="163" who="S0263">Premier Inn?</u>
<u n="164" who="S0264">yeah Premier</u>
<u n="165" who="S0263"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="166" who="S0264">Premier that one</u>
<u n="167" who="S0263">so</u>
<u n="168" who="S0264" trans="overlap">that's quite cheap</u>
<u n="169" who="S0263">the thing is a did get you know I pestered them to have that room with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> when I was last here in March so they did they've made a sort of compromise cos I'm not really supposed to have children in there</u>
<u n="170" who="S0264">oh I see</u>
<u n="171" who="S0263">so I don't feel I want to sort of quibble now about</u>
<u n="172" who="S0264">no but you could er you could ask rather than quibble</u>
<u n="173" who="S0263">mm</u>
<u n="174" who="S0264" trans="overlap">I mean it could be a question</u>
<u n="175" who="S0263">so I could say</u>
<u n="176" who="S0264">can I check something?</u>
<u n="177" who="S0263">mm</u>
<u n="178" who="S0264">that's like how it was originally put it</u>
<u n="179" who="S0263">I was surprised at the figure cos it was I have to go back to my old emails or <pause dur="short"/> from March and see how much I paid then</u>
<u n="180" who="S0264">well</u>
<u n="181" who="S0263">it was <trunc>mu</trunc> it's this is my own fault because I didn't get the firm price through the from them it was all up in the air</u>
<u n="182" who="S0264">well you wouldn't think would you because you you've stayed there only last year <pause dur="short"/> so why would you think it would be different?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0263">well not last year er <pause dur="short"/> a few months ago</u>
<u n="184" who="S0264">oh yes it is only a few months ago</u>
<u n="185" who="S0263"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it's er</u>
<u n="186" who="S0264" trans="overlap">well there you are</u>
<u n="187" who="S0263" trans="overlap">feels like a year ago</u>
<u n="188" who="S0264">yeah</u>
<u n="189" who="S0263">so I'm gonna go back and see how much I've paid and say you know <trunc>wh</trunc> why is it double the price? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="190" who="S0264">mm</u>
<u n="191" who="S0263">and</u>
<u n="192" who="S0264" trans="overlap">no I think that's perfectly reasonable</u>
<u n="193" who="S0263" trans="overlap">it could be yeah</u>
<u n="194" who="S0264">I was gonna say that one of the erm <pause dur="short"/> the you know one of the changes about this place is the erm outsourcing</u>
<u n="195" who="S0263">mm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0264">but <anon type="place"/> is er independent isn't it?</u>
<u n="197" who="S0263">mm</u>
<u n="198" who="S0264">so</u>
<u n="199" who="S0263">what's happened about that? have they <pause dur="short"/> still all well the same staff or so it seems have they er outsourced or not?</u>
