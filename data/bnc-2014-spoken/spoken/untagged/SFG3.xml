<u n="1174" who="S0334">and it's not getting lost in you know other costs so</u>
<u n="1175" who="S0262">do any small charities erm? <pause dur="short"/> I've <trunc>de</trunc> I've never seen it but <pause dur="short"/> in my mind I know erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> that I'm a person who supports individuals as in they head up <pause dur="short"/> a charity</u>
<u n="1176" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0262">you know a local charity or international charity <pause dur="short"/> but it's the individual for me <pause dur="short"/> that makes all the difference</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0262">erm <pause dur="short"/> because I need that kind of contact with the person to <pause dur="short"/> to understand</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0262">and to <pause dur="short"/> er not to understand but just to sort of feel like a <pause dur="short"/> human warmth right a kind of contact you know?</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0262">erm <pause dur="short"/> and though I may never ever visit that particular place or the children or whatever <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> it would be lovely to <pause dur="short"/> but it's not essential for me because</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0262">in a way I have contact with the</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0262">individual</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0262">so that kind of means that I get <unclear>involved</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> but I wonder because like when I think about people that are supported and and their charities <pause dur="short"/> good charities I should say <pause dur="short"/> I'm always looking for ways to <pause dur="short"/> I suppose thematically I am very interested in children <pause dur="short"/> you know the types of charities I support</u>
<u n="1190" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0262">are pretty much always student <unclear>er</unclear> student</u>

<u n="1193" who="S0262" whoConfidence="low">woo</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0334"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1195" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> my students <pause dur="short"/> I've been writing this paper about bloody university students <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="1197" who="S0262"><unclear>there was about two or three</unclear></u>
<u n="1198" who="S0334" whoConfidence="low">yeah okay</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0262">so I wonder if there is like thematically <pause dur="short"/> you know erm <pause dur="short"/> a way of drawing together <pause dur="short"/> the sort of <pause dur="short"/> the overall benefit in a world that when we have somebody like you know and your charities working in Ecuador and <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> and the surrounding environment <pause dur="short"/> and then you've got another person who's <trunc>pro</trunc>probably quite a standalone charity as it's really a one man band</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0262">yeah you've got supporters and trustees but <pause dur="short"/> I wonder if there's narratives there I wonder if there's kind of cross sections and <trunc>w</trunc> this isn't for the video this is</u>
<u n="1202" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1203" who="S0262">this is just me thinking off the top of my head <pause dur="short"/> that people <pause dur="short"/> could probably when they think about <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> could actually give fifty quid <pause dur="short"/> to to <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> <pause dur="short"/> could give fifty quid to <anon type="name" nameType="n"/></u>
<u n="1204" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0262">but these two kind of combine their thoughts their ideas <pause dur="short"/> they could be one could be in Africa and one in South America <unclear>but</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> there's something about this idea of people <pause dur="short"/> seeing this sense of community</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0262">and I don't mean it in a blah blah community</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0262">kinda way <pause dur="short"/> it's kinda like these are these are people who are working their socks off <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> how how does that link together that <trunc>th</trunc>this is kind of an idea of erm <pause dur="short"/> synergy in the world <pause dur="short"/> cos that gives you a good feeling</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0262">like if you've just a one man if you're just one person who only ever gives money to erm <pause dur="short"/> children In Need whatever it is <pause dur="short"/> and that all gets syphoned off to different charities</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0334">yes</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0262">apparently anyway <pause dur="short"/> it's like how do the little charities the lower charities whatever how do they actually compete?</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0334">we don't</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0334">we can't</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0262">you can't <pause dur="short"/> exactly so you've got a different sort of message you've got a different way of <pause dur="short"/> explaining <pause dur="short"/> why this is more or as important as <unclear>important</unclear> than</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0334" trans="overlap">but why <pause dur="short"/> as as <pause dur="short"/> joe Public why would you choose <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> over Oxfam? <pause dur="short"/> why <trunc>w</trunc>would you? I can't</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0262">well</u>

<u n="1223" who="S0262">well this is why I think erm I <trunc>d</trunc> I do choose because I I think I erm always look at the person and their their story <pause dur="short"/> I'm very focused on the stories like not story as in made up story</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0334" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0262">part of the idea is that you know I know I know how <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> got started you know I don't know anything about it now but</u>

<u n="1249" who="S0262">was gonna happen <pause dur="short"/> and that was gonna happen <pause dur="short"/> it was like I had a a nuance of an idea <pause dur="short"/> we were gonna take a long time to get to where it got to to even become a charity</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0262">then when it did and took off <pause dur="short"/> so I think people are interested because in a sort of way they have <pause dur="short"/> maybe a dream a fantasy</u>

<u n="1294" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0262">and this is some of the results that we're getting <pause dur="short"/> I mean I think that <pause dur="short"/> in a way small <trunc>ch</trunc> small charities are an easier job because I think they can be quite confined</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0262">as in</u>
<u n="1298" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0262">message message boring boring <pause dur="short"/> I <unclear>could</unclear> go <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah if I gave my fifty quid <pause dur="short"/> I'm not thinking about how much I can get for that fifty quid</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0262">I'm thinking about that fifty quid <pause dur="short"/> it's for something that solves a problem</u>

<u n="1303" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and you've got to trust in the other way that people are solving problems</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0262">you wanna put your hand up and volunteer and say I can help you solve a problem that's up to you but</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0262">at least you're saying I'm putting my fifty quid down because <pause dur="short"/> there is a problem there I understand it and these people are helping solve that problem</u>

<u n="1309" who="S0262">good</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0262">fifty quid there you go done five quid done <pause dur="short"/> what I can't stand with these big charities <pause dur="short"/> is the emotional erm <vocal desc="misc"/> the pathos behind it you know the pull</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1313" who="S0262">oh your heart strings</u>
<u n="1314" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1315" who="S0262">and I hate the way they go <pause dur="short"/> so erm financial <pause dur="short"/> commercialist <pause dur="short"/> for one pound twenty-four you'll be able to buy this <pause dur="short"/> for ten pounds a month you'll be able to</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0334" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0334">but that's <pause dur="short"/> that's really weird because a lot of people say to me <pause dur="short"/> I want to know what my ten pounds will get <pause dur="short"/> they wanna they really do wanna know it's gonna buy so and so</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0262">do people say that?</u>
<u n="1319" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1320" who="S0262">and d'you know how to answer that question yet?</u>
<u n="1321" who="S0334">erm</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0262">truthfully cos I think sometimes I wonder how much Oxfam lies about that or the other big ones <pause dur="short"/> they know the unit price for something <pause dur="short"/> they don't know the actual price <pause dur="short"/> cos you've got <pause dur="short"/> the flights in for the stuff you know all the variables <pause dur="short"/> it's like</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0262">okay they can say it's ten pounds <pause dur="short"/> but the volunteers how much are they worth?</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0262">if this is almost a it's a never ending circle of a of <unclear>an idea</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> I think if you go down that road <pause dur="short"/> it's hard for you to remain keep your integrity about it</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0262">cos prices change as well <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>have to add up <pause dur="short"/> the fact</unclear></u>
<u n="1329" who="S0334" trans="overlap">does anybody think about that deeply? I think I can say to people okay your ten pounds a month will</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0334">pay for <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> can't even <vocal desc="laugh"/> think <pause dur="short"/> like <pause dur="short"/> a week of meals <pause dur="short"/> one</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0334">day</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0334">that's just</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0334">an example</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0334">they wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> I don't think they'd then go away and think well that's gonna cost different in a week after because</u>
<u n="1340" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no they wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>right</unclear> they wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> they wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> but in a way what you're doing is you're mirroring what the bigger charities do</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1342" who="S0262">and I'm having a pop at the bigger charities <pause dur="short"/> not at the concept of you saying</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1344" who="S0262">but I do actually fundamentally ask the question why do we need to know <pause dur="short"/> exactly like an accountant? <pause dur="short"/> who says that we have to think like accountants? why do we ask these questions? who's told us that we have to <unclear>have</unclear> these questions?</u>
<u n="1345" who="S0334" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0262">is it because I'm sitting there actually having my coffee and going <pause dur="short"/> I could buy this coffee or I could now donate that money and put that coffee to <pause dur="short"/> I could</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0334">but</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0262">three pounds fifty I'm gonna get</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0334">don't you think that turn it on its head and people would see that <pause dur="short"/> I'm wasting three pound fifty on this coffee when actually look at how much you could do over there?</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>c</trunc> I do think it is about that I think there is an element of that and er that makes sense for some people <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> what I think is is that <pause dur="short"/> yeah but erm <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> from my understanding is charities get started like say for example <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> was that you saw a real life problem with your eyes</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0262">you've perceived you've sensed it you've touched it</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0262">you've talked to those parents you've talked to those children this is real for you <pause dur="short"/> as real as it was for them <pause dur="short"/> it's a shared reality</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0334" trans="overlap">yeah but that's part of the problem though</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0334">other people haven't had that <pause dur="short"/> and aren't affected by that</u>
<u n="1358" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0334">I I don't think you can ever</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0262" trans="overlap">but but you're experiencing that you've been able to articulate <pause dur="short"/> and tell people that this is what the problem is <pause dur="short"/> you know I've put the question to myself what is the problem here? and tried really hard</u>
<u n="1361" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1362" who="S0262">to answer it <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>u</trunc> you can't raising money willy nilly for things but you don't</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0334">no</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0262">know what the problem is and even how to answer it <pause dur="short"/> you've had to think really hard <pause dur="short"/> about how to answer that problem <pause dur="short"/> and that is something you can communicate to your well wishers and supporters <pause dur="short"/> they can't lose sight <pause dur="short"/> money yes money is one thing it's a kind of erm <pause dur="short"/> to me it's like a triangle of <pause dur="short"/> money is just a part of why <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>we are</unclear> interested in charities</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0262">what I'd like to believe is that people probably do have three levels <trunc>u</trunc> of <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> connecting with a charity <pause dur="short"/> one is the intellectual argument</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0334">uhu</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0262">another is probably <unclear>a very</unclear> emotional response</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0334" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0262">and probably the third one is about integrity it's the integrity of the charity</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0262">and what it stands for</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0262">which still probably comes round to the logic of <pause dur="short"/> what is the problem</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0262">and how are we answering it and what are the problems about trying to answer this problem?</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0262">you know question <pause dur="short"/> they're some of the things that people actually if they <pause dur="short"/> if they're gonna be more like a lifetime supporter I would hope that people engage with your charity like on the <trunc>l</trunc></u>
<u n="1379" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0262">one of those</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0262">not two</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1384" who="S0262">but those people can just go <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="yawn"/> oh yeah you know on that day three pound fifty oh yeah you're right I'll forgo my coffee and make myself feel better at <unclear>for at least</unclear></u>
<u n="1385" who="S0334" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0262">half an hour but I'm still gonna go and buy coffee <unclear>in <anon type="place"/></unclear></u>
<u n="1387" who="S0334" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1388" who="S0262">I mean those sort of people I I don't really understand because again</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0334" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0262">but that doesn't mean to say they're not valuable because they are</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0334" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1392" who="S0262">cos they will get <unclear>reach in</unclear> and give you money <pause dur="short"/> but it depends what your video is trying to achieve <pause dur="short"/> I mean I would've thought <pause dur="short"/> the the previous example like the emotion</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0262">the argument</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0262">the integrity of er of the charity <pause dur="short"/> these are things that make up</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0334">mm <pause dur="short"/> I guess it's how you put those things into a video though isn't it?</u>
<u n="1398" who="S0262" trans="overlap"><unclear>the narrative</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> you wouldn't yeah you wouldn't</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0334">but no you need to <pause dur="short"/> I'd want to be able to put a bit of that in</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0262">well <pause dur="short"/> animation's very popular <pause dur="short"/> and I wonder if there is something where you could have <pause dur="short"/> so you've got people who are <unclear><anon type="name" nameType="n"/></unclear> <pause dur="short"/> and rather than writing something on the little white card imagine that there is a person with the white card <pause dur="short"/> so you can see their face or <pause dur="short"/> whatever they do <pause dur="short"/> and then on the white card rather than having something written <pause dur="short"/> like the reality that you've written it</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0262">you could actually have a little charity <pause dur="short"/> er sorry little animation play out on that white piece of paper</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0334">right</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that <pause dur="short"/> these days there are software programs</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0334" trans="overlap"><unclear>I don't know if I understood that</unclear></u>
<u n="1406" who="S0262" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">no no no <pause dur="short"/> I know</u>
<u n="1407" who="S0262">but no but you get the person to if they if they're interested</u>
<u n="1408" who="UNKFEMALE" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">oop</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0262">you could ask the ask the person <pause dur="short"/> say look <pause dur="short"/> erm I'm doing a video <pause dur="short"/> I wanna make it more <trunc>animina</trunc>animated because I know that you know things that move</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1411" who="S0262">appeals to a younger <pause dur="short"/> generation as well so you've gotta think of them <pause dur="short"/> erm and there are software er <trunc>app</trunc>apps <pause dur="short"/> I mean I've played around with a couple <pause dur="short"/> you just put in they're little stick men</u>
<u n="1412" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1413" who="S0262">you just put it <pause dur="short"/> this is me <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> with the little hair <pause dur="short"/> big blue eyes whatever <pause dur="short"/> not even colour you don't even have to do that <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> what did <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> do? well she went off to you know pick some apples off a tree <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> you put tree <pause dur="short"/> apples and it just basically <pause dur="short"/> it just makes the animation all for you</u>
<u n="1414" who="S0334" trans="overlap"><unclear>right <pause dur="short"/> erm</unclear></u>
<u n="1415" who="S0262">it's incredible <pause dur="short"/> and you can get quite specific with it <pause dur="short"/> but that I would say something which is a bit more dynamic</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0262">appeal to it <pause dur="short"/> it's quite nice because in a way yeah you would probably have to have someone who would edit it together but</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0262">when you make a video anyway you still need an editor</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0262">regardless</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0262">and most editors do know about animation you know they would know how to put that on top of the white card you know? you'd need somebody who <pause dur="short"/> isn't basic editor yeah somebody maybe a little intermediate</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0334" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0262">but you know maybe that's somebody that you know maybe somebody who could volunteer to do that <pause dur="short"/> minute <pause dur="short"/> it could be forty seconds</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0262">you know you're not asking a lot from an editor you're you know you're talking about a few people perhaps</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0334" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0262">but I'm just thinking about some way to <pause dur="short"/> bring it to life</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0262">have a little dynamic colour sense to it <pause dur="short"/> so say there's Zambathon a <trunc>Sumboth</trunc> sorry a Sunbathon</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0334">Zumbathon yeah</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0262">you can imagine that in animation</u>
<u n="1434" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1435" who="S0262">you know little stick men women</u>
<u n="1436" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1437" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> dancing <pause dur="short"/> <unclear><trunc>da</trunc></unclear> whatever they're doing <pause dur="short"/> you could see that it'd be quite funny to watch</u>
<u n="1438" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1439" who="S0262">you know</u>
<u n="1440" who="S0334">it's a really good idea</u>
<u n="1441" who="S0262">mm <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure</u>
<u n="1442" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1443" who="S0262">but <pause dur="short"/> there is there's stuff out there for free <pause dur="short"/> this stuff is good</u>
<u n="1444" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1445" who="S0262">you know <pause dur="short"/> I dunno just thinking off the top of my head but <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> you know and in a way <trunc>th</trunc> you know the the message is what exactly and that's the whole thing about video <pause dur="short"/> is that</u>
<u n="1446" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1447" who="S0262">the ones that really <trunc>u</trunc> resonate <pause dur="short"/> have got a really strong message like the purpose behind the video is very clear</u>
<u n="1448" who="S0334" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1449" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you know? so</u>
<u n="1450" who="S0334">obviously I'm reluctant <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> that heart string thing I don't think always works</u>
<u n="1451" who="S0262">no</u>
<u n="1452" who="S0334">but <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I don't know really <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I think you you wanna see some positivity don't you?</u>
<u n="1453" who="S0262">you do <pause dur="short"/> you wanna see results and <pause dur="short"/> you know say if you were using a video as erm a little way to sort of draw in the community of <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> together again you know it might be might've started to unravel <trunc>s</trunc> a little bit over the sort of past couple of years and what we really just tried to do is <pause dur="short"/> you know pull sort of er the crowd back in together <pause dur="short"/> erm and and get a little bit of oomph <pause dur="short"/> back into it you know kick</u>
<u n="1454" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1455" who="S0262">kick it into into touch a little bit more and <pause dur="short"/> so that would be quite plausible because then people would watch the video and go <pause dur="short"/> oh that's like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s friend I met that you know or <pause dur="short"/> or that you know yeah I I <trunc>th</trunc> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's a little bit more about holding up a mirror</u>
<u n="1456" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1457" who="S0262">to people</u>
<u n="1458" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1459" who="S0262">I think people can engage with that <pause dur="short"/> but if say if it wasn't the message wasn't or the intention wasn't there <pause dur="short"/> it say it was about actually trying <trunc>p</trunc> to draw awareness to a whole new crowd of people <pause dur="short"/> that would be a completely different</u>
<u n="1460" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1461" who="S0262">type of video</u>
<u n="1462" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1463" who="S0262">it would have <pause dur="short"/> you know different story it would have a different <pause dur="short"/> it depends really on what you're trying to achieve with it I think the video idea's really good it's just about you know what's my purpose? who is my key audience?</u>
<u n="1464" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1465" who="S0262">that sorta thing</u>
<u n="1466" who="S0334">yeah</u>
<u n="1467" who="S0262"><unclear>mm</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> and it could be <pause dur="short"/> it could be that it's just drawing the <pause dur="short"/> the supporters back in <pause dur="short"/> just saying okay you know remember <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> we <trunc>th</trunc> had these ideas <pause dur="short"/> now we're looking for some new ones <pause dur="short"/> or you've already got new ideas <trunc>t</trunc> but you're looking for people to put their hand up and go yeah I I kind of <trunc>res</trunc> that one resonates</u>
<u n="1468" who="S0334">mm</u>
<u n="1469" who="S0262">but me I'd like to do that one <pause dur="short"/> so these could be new cards like write your own cards you know it could be somebody at the end going <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> in a year's time this could be on this this video <pause dur="short"/> it's kind like question mark you or you know or <pause dur="short"/> your own animation question mark or <pause dur="short"/> you know anything where you're actually saying to someone the message is <pause dur="short"/> you can engage with me <pause dur="short"/> and the er charity <pause dur="short"/> you you can come towards me I'm open for you to come towards me and</u>
