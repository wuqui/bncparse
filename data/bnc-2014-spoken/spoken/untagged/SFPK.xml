<u n="205" who="S0281">what was he thinking of?</u>
<u n="206" who="S0015">well exactly you know just a nutcase they they shouldn't employ people like that really so erm but you know said he's sorry</u>
<u n="207" who="S0281" trans="overlap">oh sorry I forgot to dry</u>
<u n="208" who="S0015">reluctantly no it's alright he said sorry reluctantly <pause dur="short"/> but I think what <unclear>she</unclear> got they're they're extortionately expensive this estate agent erm <unclear>and</unclear> you know something like four thousand pounds they charge to sell the house and I she's now asking for a reduction in the in the their charges</u>
<u n="209" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="210" who="S0015">they've not been very good <unclear>they're</unclear> bloody useless they've got the most awful reputation and she'd known if she used her computer before she could've gone online and seen their reviews about them</u>
<u n="211" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="212" who="S0015">and it's just awful but this is where you're also much more vulnerable <pause dur="short"/> when you don't you know you can't have you can't access things like that <pause dur="short"/> but the thing is they've got a buyer for this house but she hasn't found another house that she wants so they haven't sent her any</u>
<u n="213" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="214" who="S0015">so</u>
<u n="215" who="S0281">so presumably she's got a contract with these people?</u>
<u n="216" who="S0015">yeah she has got a contract with them and it's a terrible contract it says</u>
<u n="217" who="S0281" trans="overlap">well can't can't she get out if it? by saying you've broken the terms of your contract?</u>
<u n="218" who="S0015" trans="overlap">yeah they they said yes you can get out of it but if she then said say for instance these people are hanging on wanting her house what they've said they've said if those people then have registered with other estate agents which is what you'll all do you go to loads of them and put your name down and you get you know houses from them if they came to her and sold you would have to pay their fees and the new estate agents <unclear>so</unclear> it would be eight thousand</u>
<u n="219" who="S0281">huh</u>
<u n="220" who="S0015">well <trunc>co</trunc> and if they come privately up to two years later</u>
