<u n="260" who="S0513" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="261" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">you choose one then someone opens another door and it has a goat behind it should you <trunc>sh</trunc> change which one you choose assuming you want a car</u>
<u n="262" who="S0513" whoConfidence="low">yeah because then you've got a fifty-fifty chance right</u>
<u n="263" who="S0511">mm</u>
<u n="264" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">er</u>
<u n="265" who="S0512" trans="overlap">but you have</u>
<u n="266" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">actually it's a two-thirds chance</u>

<u n="268" who="S0513" whoConfidence="low">is it?</u>
<u n="269" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="270" who="S0512" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="271" who="S0511">so I so you</u>
<u n="272" who="S0512" trans="overlap">but <unclear/></u>
<u n="273" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">what you're effectively doing is choosing both the goat the both your already opened door and the car one</u>
<u n="274" who="S0511">hang on a minute</u>
<u n="275" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">and the other one</u>
<u n="276" who="S0511">can we just start</u>
<u n="277" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">and taking whichever one's</u>
<u n="278" who="S0511">hang on a minute can we just start again? so I've got a door</u>
<u n="279" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low"><unclear/></u>
<u n="280" who="S0511">A B and C</u>
<u n="281" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="282" who="S0511">and there are there behind them there's two goats and a car and</u>
<u n="283" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">yes</u>
<u n="284" who="S0511">we're assuming you want the car</u>
<u n="285" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="286" who="S0511">so in my head I'm going to choose door A</u>
<u n="287" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">you say you choose <trunc>d</trunc> you're going to choose door A</u>
<u n="288" who="S0511" trans="overlap">okay I choose door A</u>
<u n="289" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yeah and then</u>
<u n="290" who="S0511">does it get opened?</u>
<u n="291" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">someone else opens say</u>
<u n="292" who="S0512" trans="overlap">door</u>
<u n="293" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">door B and there's a goat behind it</u>
<u n="294" who="S0511">okay</u>
<u n="295" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">should you switch?</u>
<u n="296" who="S0511" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="297" who="S0512">to door C</u>
<u n="298" who="S0511" trans="overlap">and I know that the truth is you should</u>
<u n="299" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yes</u>
<u n="300" who="S0511" trans="overlap">so when I've made my first decision there was a one in three</u>
<u n="301" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="302" who="S0511">chance</u>
<u n="303" who="S0512" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="304" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">so what you're gonna effectively do now is choose both the other doors and take whichever one is right</u>
<u n="305" who="S0511">how can I do that?</u>
<u n="306" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">well if you <trunc>choo</trunc> if you swap to the other one</u>
<u n="307" who="S0511">C?</u>
<u n="308" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="309" who="S0512">yeah</u>
<u n="310" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">then you er it's like a way of imagining it it just if you swap to the other one then there's a chance that the car we can I dunno I don't know how to explain it better than you can effectively choose the other two</u>
<u n="311" who="S0511"><vocal desc="laugh"/> you're really not cut out for a teacher are you? so <vocal desc="laugh"/> behind door we can now disregard door B</u>
<u n="312" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="313" who="S0512" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="314" who="S0511">let's go and we know</u>
<u n="315" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">well no we can't disregard door B</u>
<u n="316" who="S0511">ah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">cos there's still three doors</u>
<u n="318" who="S0512">mm</u>
<u n="319" who="S0513" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">yeah and you just know that <unclear/></u>
<u n="320" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">we just know that one of them has the goat behind it</u>
<u n="321" who="S0511">and so we've got two remaining doors</u>
<u n="322" who="S0512">one with a goat</u>
<u n="323" who="S0511" trans="overlap">and a fifty-fifty chance of one having a goat of of er of either of them having the car?</u>
<u n="324" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yes</u>
<u n="325" who="S0511">so why does me changing my mind <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="326" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">well er it's definitely better than the first one because that was a one-third chance</u>
<u n="327" who="S0511">yes so I so I'm</u>
<u n="328" who="S0512" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="329" who="S0511" trans="overlap">already down to fifty-fifty</u>
<u n="330" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yeah but</u>
<u n="331" who="S0511" trans="overlap">so why</u>
<u n="332" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">I think it's also two-thirds I can't in fact remember</u>
<u n="333" who="S0513" whoConfidence="low">oh great</u>
<u n="334" who="S0511">but your</u>
<u n="335" who="S0512" trans="overlap">but if it's</u>

<u n="342" who="S0512" trans="overlap">I it I er</u>
<u n="343" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">and he also backed this up with some really rubbish statistics where basically</u>
<u n="344" who="S0511" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="345" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">we did it three times</u>
<u n="346" who="S0511">mm</u>
<u n="347" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">and did it four times sorry and we got a fifty percent chance of getting the car but the person who was doing it didn't always switch or stay</u>
<u n="348" who="S0511">right so that you're and so the you weren't doing the same</u>
<u n="349" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0511" trans="overlap">thing over so you can</u>
