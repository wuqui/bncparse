<u n="795" who="S0024">yeah it was nice cos it was it was kind of spontaneous</u>
<u n="796" who="S0144">well cos we were doing our Masters as well and we we had no money</u>
<u n="797" who="S0024">mm mm</u>
<u n="798" who="S0144">and so that was a big thing not having to pay <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="799" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="800" who="S0144">we were skint</u>
<u n="801" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="802" who="S0144">like we were in debt then weren't we?</u>
<u n="803" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="804" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="805" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="806" who="S0144">that was a tough year that was</u>
<u n="807" who="S0024">yeah who was saying? oh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was saying to me today oh there's this great course on for Chinese you just have to pay er pay for a year's subscription and it's you know it's quite a lot of money or what I would would've said is quite a lot of money but actually now that we've got a little bit behind us I'm willing to pay for a better course than free ones</u>
<u n="808" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="809" who="S0024">and I said to him oh I would've never even considered paying before but if you say that it's good</u>
<u n="810" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="811" who="S0024">cos did you hear his Chinese tonight was very good?</u>
<u n="812" who="S0144">well yeah er he's been studying full time for a year and a half</u>
<u n="813" who="S0024">mm erm but I would've never considered paying money for like an internet course before but he reckons it's pretty good it's like <trunc>s</trunc> just some listening files so you can just listen to them on the way I can just listen to it on the way to work</u>
<u n="814" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="815" who="S0024">so I thought that might be quite good for me <unclear/></u>
<u n="816" who="S0144">it's listening files? can't you just copy it off someone else?</u>
<u n="817" who="S0024">well that's yeah well I <trunc>s</trunc>I said do you you download it? but I think he <trunc>d</trunc> listens to it on the internet</u>
<u n="818" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="819" who="S0024">which is a problem actually walking to work cos you can't mm</u>
<u n="820" who="S0144">yeah yeah if you can't download it then</u>
<u n="821" who="S0024">no</u>
<u n="822" who="S0144">you don't get much chance here listening to stuff</u>
<u n="823" who="S0024"><unclear/> maybe I'll ask him again maybe he's downloaded them all but then they wouldn't be able to do that because they wouldn't want people to share the <trunc>f</trunc> the files if then you'd just pay for a course between a whole load of people and share it</u>
<u n="824" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="825" who="S0024">so I doubt if they'd do that</u>
<u n="826" who="S0144">no no that'd be silly wouldn't it</u>
<u n="827" who="S0024">at least I got my video on Facebook with that copyright</u>
<u n="828" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="829" who="S0024">I don't consider that a copyright issue</u>
<u n="830" who="S0144">well no it's not these copyright laws are so archaic we need to redo it cos it's you know we're in the digital fucking world now people are gonna share stuff share songs you know put songs to your videos and you you can't</u>
<u n="831" who="S0024">I see that as publicising</u>
<u n="832" who="S0144">yeah it is</u>
<u n="833" who="S0024">because they can't copy that song it's not like they can</u>
<u n="834" who="S0144">no</u>
<u n="835" who="S0024">listen to it on their own</u>
<u n="836" who="S0144">no</u>
<u n="837" who="S0024">they have to watch the video</u>
<u n="838" who="S0144">no and they're like oh <trunc>w</trunc>what was that song? I really like that</u>
<u n="839" who="S0024">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="840" who="S0144">let me okay now I know what it is I'll download it for free <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="841" who="S0024">well yeah</u>
<u n="842" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah but <unclear> you can't</unclear></u>
<u n="843" who="S0024">but like with er like on the video</u>
<u n="844" who="S0144">you can't stop it</u>
<u n="845" who="S0024">that I made with the pictures that's publicising that's not copyright</u>
<u n="846" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="847" who="S0024">I don't think</u>
<u n="848" who="S0144">mm yeah I I think copyright law needs to be readdressed</u>
<u n="849" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="850" who="S0144">it's just</u>
<u n="851" who="S0024">I was so upset when that happened but</u>
<u n="852" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="853" who="S0024">I'm really glad that <unclear>I put it up again</unclear></u>
<u n="854" who="S0144">well I think you know like I said I think I think Facebook must have a team of people in the US</u>
<u n="855" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="856" who="S0144">going through just er</u>
<u n="857" who="S0024">huh</u>
<u n="858" who="S0144">just a random kind of check</u>
<u n="859" who="S0024">must've been random must be random</u>
<u n="860" who="S0144">of videos getting posted of a certain length and just seeing if it's got music or copyrighted material</u>
<u n="861" who="S0024">that's weird cos it's not the length of one song it's the length of two songs</u>
<u n="862" who="S0144">and you just happened to have one that was checked by someone</u>
<u n="863" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="864" who="S0144">so when you redid it it would've been outside of the US working hours</u>
<u n="865" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="866" who="S0144">and it was fine so</u>
<u n="867" who="S0024">what a job to watch people's private videos</u>
<u n="868" who="S0144">yeah but I suppose Facebook are <trunc>pr</trunc>probably kind of legally obliged to do that now they probably have pressure from er record companies and</u>
<u n="869" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="870" who="S0144">er I dunno movie companies</u>
<u n="871" who="S0024">what about Youtube then?</u>
<u n="872" who="S0144">well Youtube yeah erm well they are they <trunc>d</trunc> they do delete things</u>
<u n="873" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="874" who="S0144">but it's a needle in a haystack how can you stop it? for the million er millions of people that post some something how can you actually check it? because you can't you can't set up a computer program to check that kind of thing it has to be done with a <trunc>hu</trunc> a human</u>
<u n="875" who="S0024">mm can't they can't a computer program check the wavelengths of like what's contained within video?</u>
<u n="876" who="S0144">what?</u>
<u n="877" who="S0024">like the songs</u>
<u n="878" who="S0144">what? to recognise the wavelength of a particular song?</u>
<u n="879" who="S0024">yeah it would be like recognising a fingerprint</u>
<u n="880" who="S0144">not not at the moment</u>
<u n="881" who="S0024">you have a huge database of er of <trunc>wa</trunc></u>
<u n="882" who="S0144">well in theory yeah but</u>
<u n="883" who="S0024">like a fingerprint database</u>
<u n="884" who="S0144">what? every? if you think of every song that's ever been produced you'd have to set up a whole <vocal desc="laugh"/> system of people putting these things in for every single song into this system</u>
<u n="885" who="S0024">well yeah but once you've got a fast enough computer that should be easy enough shouldn't it? if people want your</u>
<u n="886" who="S0144">well er <trunc>f</trunc></u>
<u n="887" who="S0024">want their work copyrighted specially then they'd just plonk it into the <trunc>s</trunc> they just submit</u>
<u n="888" who="S0144">yeah but er</u>
<u n="889" who="S0024">they submit the song that they want</u>
<u n="890" who="S0144">yeah in the future I think that would be hopefully conceivable</u>
<u n="891" who="S0024">the computer records the wavelength</u>
<u n="892" who="S0144">but is it worth paying all that money to set up that kind of system? which is a huge project</u>
<u n="893" who="S0024">well</u>
<u n="894" who="S0144">it's massive right?</u>
<u n="895" who="S0024">probably better than paying a thousand people to</u>
<u n="896" who="S0144">yeah but</u>
<u n="897" who="S0024">randomly check</u>
<u n="898" who="S0144">what I was saying about the copyright law it's surely gotta change? so it's kind of a <trunc>d</trunc> redundant thing to do I think</u>
<u n="899" who="S0024">mm yeah</u>
<u n="900" who="S0144">cos I mean I know they're they're pushing it in like the UK and the US this copyright stuff but look at the rest of the world they've got no copyright laws at all</u>
<u n="901" who="S0024">no</u>
<u n="902" who="S0144">everyone just downloads anything they want</u>
<u n="903" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="904" who="S0144">they they put the fear on you in in Europe</u>
<u n="905" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="906" who="S0144">cos they they can kinda track your IP address and</u>
<u n="907" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="908" who="S0144">but the rest of the world don't give a shit about that what what does the Chinese government care about you're not paying some British record company their dues?</u>
<u n="909" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="910" who="S0144">they've got no fucking concern</u>
<u n="911" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="912" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="913" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="long"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> what you gonna do tonight?</u>
<u n="914" who="S0144">I dunno I haven't heard back from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> so let's have some food I'll give him a ring</u>
<u n="915" who="S0024">oh god I forgot food huh we could've had the baked potatoes in all this time</u>
<u n="916" who="S0144">tut oh</u>
<u n="917" who="S0024">it'd be ready now</u>
<u n="918" who="S0144"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="919" who="S0024">we forgot</u>
<u n="920" who="S0144">well I'll stop this and then I'll give <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> a ring</u>
<u n="921" who="S0024">okay</u>
