<u n="432" who="S0511" trans="overlap">oh and then again and again again</u>
<u n="433" who="S0514" trans="overlap">and then it <pause dur="short"/> uses up memory until the computer just crashes</u>
<u n="434" who="S0511">okay</u>
<u n="435" who="S0512"><unclear>I also wanted <pause dur="short"/> er</unclear></u>
<u n="436" who="S0511" trans="overlap"><trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="437" who="S0512"><unclear>sorry tell him</unclear></u>
<u n="438" who="S0511">I was <trunc>g</trunc> I was wondering if after supper <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> can show us <pause dur="short"/> one of these pictures that's a programming language a program</u>
<u n="439" who="S0514">mm</u>
<u n="440" who="S0511">language thing</u>
<u n="441" who="S0514"><unclear>oh yeah</unclear></u>
<u n="442" who="S0512">last year I was on Hour of Code which was really hilariously bad and I spent several hours on it</u>
<u n="443" who="S0513" whoConfidence="low"><unclear/></u>
<u n="444" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="445" who="S0512">but the interesting thing was that</u>
<u n="446" who="S0513" trans="overlap">yeah we spent like five weeks on an hour of code didn't we?</u>
<u n="447" who="S0512" trans="overlap">like <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="448" who="S0513"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="449" who="S0512">each lesson's an hour long</u>
<u n="450" who="S0511">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="451" who="S0512">erm <pause dur="short"/> and we erm <pause dur="short"/> copy and paste and copy and pasting</u>
<u n="452" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="453" who="S0511" trans="overlap">were you supposed to have an hour of code a week maybe?</u>
<u n="454" who="S0512" trans="overlap">yeah but no I <pause dur="short"/> I got sixty million lines of code</u>
<u n="455" who="S0511">why?</u>
<u n="456" who="S0513" whoConfidence="low">why?</u>
<u n="457" who="S0512">and then it crashed the server</u>
<u n="458" who="S0513">well that's not very surprising</u>
<u n="459" who="S0512" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="460" who="S0511">why did you do that? <unclear>cos of er</unclear></u>
<u n="461" who="S0512" trans="overlap"><unclear>just wanted</unclear></u>
<u n="462" who="S0514" trans="overlap">well you should've implemented safety for that</u>
<u n="463" who="S0512">yeah and after that erm the server was so slow <pause dur="short"/> that you couldn't get any more than thirty million</u>
<u n="464" who="S0514"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="465" who="S0513">when</u>
<u n="466" who="S0511">yeah</u>
<u n="467" who="S0513">you were doing Python last year</u>
<u n="468" who="S0512">but everyone's computer was <unclear/></u>
<u n="469" who="S0513" trans="overlap">I mean <unclear><anon type="name" nameType="n"/></unclear> computer just say <pause dur="short"/> <unclear><anon type="name" nameType="n"/></unclear> sucks over and over and over and over again <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="470" who="S0511"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> so it's good that you use</u>
<u n="471" who="S0514" trans="overlap">and that is like the most basic program ever</u>
<u n="472" who="S0511" trans="overlap">you you use new technology to still be rude to one another</u>
<u n="473" who="S0514" trans="overlap">that's <pause dur="short"/> it's the <pause dur="short"/> the original program in BASIC</u>
<u n="474" who="S0511">is <unclear><anon type="name" nameType="n"/></unclear> sucks?</u>
<u n="475" who="S0514">is twenty <pause dur="short"/> print hello <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>prin</trunc></u>
<u n="476" who="S0511">oh</u>
<u n="477" who="S0514">ten print hello twenty go to ten</u>
<u n="478" who="S0511">oh okay right so it goes on and on and on</u>
<u n="479" who="S0514">yeah</u>
<u n="480" who="S0511">go to you see?</u>
<u n="481" who="S0514">mm</u>
<u n="482" who="S0511">see go to that's how <unclear>it's done</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> can you stop throwing bits of wax around <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>? in fact can you stop throwing things around?</u>
<u n="483" who="S0514" trans="overlap">or if it was</u>
<u n="484" who="S0512"><unclear>like a cock <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> oh</unclear></u>
<u n="485" who="S0514" trans="overlap">if <trunc>n</trunc> if it was more modern you'd say <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> int main <pause dur="short"/> print <pause dur="short"/> hello <pause dur="short"/> main</u>
<u n="486" who="S0511">right <pause dur="short"/> sort of <pause dur="short"/> I don't really understand</u>
<u n="487" who="S0514">and that would <pause dur="short"/> run in C</u>
<u n="488" who="S0511">repeatedly</u>
<u n="489" who="S0514" trans="overlap">er <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="490" who="S0511">erm how many <trunc>m</trunc> lines of code in that picture on dad's <pause dur="short"/> erm kitchen with the woman standing next to her code?</u>
<u n="491" who="S0512" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="492" who="S0514">many <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="493" who="S0512">that's very</u>
<u n="494" who="S0511" trans="overlap">is that more than sixty million <vocal desc="laugh"/> lines of code in all those bits of paper?</u>
<u n="495" who="S0514" trans="overlap">to be fair that's probably in COBOL which takes ages to write anything</u>
<u n="496" who="S0513">it was handwritten</u>
<u n="497" who="S0514">when they say by hand it doesn't mean written out by hand</u>
<u n="498" who="S0512" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="499" who="S0514">it means <pause dur="short"/> there was no <trunc>o</trunc> no previous code for it you had to make it yourself</u>
<u n="500" who="S0511">you didn't just go and get it from that place that people get bits of code from what's it called that place?</u>
<u n="501" who="S0513">Stack Overflow?</u>
<u n="502" who="S0511">yeah Stack Overflow <pause dur="short"/> they're always talking about that in my place</u>
<u n="503" who="S0513" whoConfidence="low">cool</u>
<u n="504" who="S0514" whoConfidence="low">how's it going with the job interview?</u>
<u n="505" who="S0511">well I haven't had it since yesterday</u>
<u n="506" who="S0512"><unclear>so</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> so a line is each <trunc>l</trunc> actual line?</u>
<u n="507" who="S0511">yeah</u>
<u n="508" who="S0514">usually yeah <pause dur="short"/> that would be how it works</u>
<u n="509" who="S0511" trans="overlap">I suppose that's what a line of code is</u>
<u n="510" who="S0514" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="511" who="S0511">yeah</u>
<u n="512" who="S0512">so <trunc>n</trunc> I doubt it</u>
<u n="513" who="S0513" trans="overlap">or until you finish the function and then you have to press enter <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="514" who="S0511">yes so sometimes they're short sometimes they're short and sometimes they're long</u>
<u n="515" who="S0514" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low"><unclear>but have to press</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="518" who="S0514">yeah you could but</u>
<u n="519" who="S0511" trans="overlap">cos even like a sentence is that you get the end of a thing</u>
<u n="520" who="S0514" trans="overlap">you could in theory write any program <pause dur="short"/> if it's not in Whitespace or Python all on one line</u>
<u n="521" who="S0511">that you <trunc>s</trunc> they're <trunc>sepe</trunc> that's like <trunc>sent</trunc> like full stops it's er to make it easier to read?</u>
