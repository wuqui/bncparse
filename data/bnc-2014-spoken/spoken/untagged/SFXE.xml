<u n="571" who="S0485">and other pedagogic issues and I thought what? and I wrote back and said if you if you really understand the word pedagogy you know then I'll come but since I'm absolutely certain that you don't then I won't</u>
<u n="572" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="574" who="S0428">mm</u>
<u n="575" who="S0485">so what what do you think it means exactly</u>
<u n="576" who="S0432">oh no being tested now</u>
<u n="577" who="S0428">yeah wish <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was here</u>
<u n="578" who="S0432">well we only have one person in the team that's really working on it and she looks into erm kind of teacher materials how they're used in their classroom at the teaching and learning side of</u>
<u n="579" who="S0485">what is pedagogue?</u>
<u n="580" who="S0428">I'm just scared to get it wrong</u>
<u n="581" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low">laugh</u>
<u n="582" who="S0432">yeah don't want to say any more</u>
<u n="583" who="S0428">in in the context so we where we work it's it's the study of like <trunc>commu</trunc> like teaching but communicating the how you how a how you are able to pick something up how you are able to learn something and the method</u>
<u n="584" who="S0485">but you use pedagogue almost in a derogatory sense you can do meaning someone who teaches rather pompously</u>
<u n="585" who="S0428">no that's definitely not erm the sense that it's all about <trunc>pay</trunc></u>
<u n="586" who="S0485">but you still don't still don't know what it means pedagogue is a person who teaches children</u>
<u n="587" who="S0428">is it? oh I guess I guess ped yeah yeah</u>
<u n="588" who="S0432" trans="overlap">so just</u>
<u n="589" who="S0485" trans="overlap">that's what it means</u>
<u n="590" who="S0428">yeah yeah it makes yeah</u>

<u n="593" who="S0428">mm</u>
<u n="594" who="S0485">since I knew this woman did not know that I thought well</u>
<u n="595" who="S0432">yeah so pedagogy</u>
<u n="596" who="S0485">yeah but it's changed its meaning obviously because of Latin</u>
<u n="597" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah mm</u>
<u n="598" who="S0428">yeah well it makes sense</u>
<u n="599" who="S0485">it's your actual Latin you see which you know wouldn't you? from your Italian</u>
<u n="600" who="S0428">yes</u>
<u n="601" who="S0432">that does make sense now</u>
<u n="602" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="603" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="604" who="S0485">curiously enough I did the equivalent GCSE is O level in those days I failed O level Latin</u>
<u n="605" who="S0432">oh no</u>
<u n="606" who="S0485">I I can't believe when it's such an elementary language and I taught it to my I was teaching my son Latin and I thought how <trunc>d</trunc> how could I possibly fail this and get a degree in all these other languages?</u>
<u n="607" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="608" who="S0428">just wasn't your language or?</u>

<u n="613" who="S0428">I've never well I've done Italian but I've never done Latin so erm but they're obviously very close in parts</u>
<u n="614" who="S0432" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="615" who="S0485">yeah</u>
<u n="616" who="S0428">interestingly I was living in <anon type="place"/> and and there they speak Valencian which is like a dialect of Catalan</u>
<u n="617" who="S0432">but they don't they like you saying that though</u>
<u n="618" who="S0428">yeah they don't like you saying that and you can argue where it anyway that's another like whole issue but knowing I think knowing French and Italian helps you more with understanding Valencian than knowing Spanish</u>
<u n="619" who="S0432">yeah <trunc>defin</trunc> yeah definitely</u>
<u n="620" who="S0485" trans="overlap">really?</u>

<u n="622" who="S0432">yeah and erm</u>
<u n="623" who="S0428" trans="overlap">it the way it's put together the structures it's not very Spanish</u>
<u n="624" who="S0432">no I think like Catalan as well</u>
<u n="625" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="626" who="S0432">just knowing French more than Spanish would help</u>
<u n="627" who="S0428">yeah helps</u>

<u n="638" who="S0485">oh</u>
<u n="639" who="S0432">cos I learnt the simplified version which they</u>
<u n="640" who="S0428">which is still very complicated</u>
<u n="641" who="S0432">yeah so they could help with it was mainly so they could help with the the eyesight cos Chinese people were erm they all wore glasses because they were concentrating so much on all the different parts of each character so they simplified them so they could</u>
<u n="642" who="S0428" trans="overlap">really?</u>
<u n="643" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="644" who="S0428">that's fascinating</u>
<u n="645" who="S0432">yeah because they've got the highest and they had a really high rate of erm illiteracy and it</u>
<u n="646" who="S0428">because they were so hard</u>
<u n="647" who="S0432" trans="overlap">because they were so hard so they just simplified it for their eyesight and so they could so people could learn it</u>
<u n="648" who="S0428">that's really interesting I didn't know that</u>

<u n="671" who="S0485">that implies they've been there a long time</u>
<u n="672" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="673" who="S0485">for that separation</u>
<u n="674" who="S0428">it's and he yeah it's incredible</u>

<u n="680" who="S0432">mm</u>
<u n="681" who="S0485">you know we try and work out when did language start erm <trunc>at</trunc> to the extent that I was on on the ship er in April coming up from <anon type="place"/> and we came up the  and the other lecturer with me was a musicologist he's actually amongst other things the director of the Cambridge University Shakespeare festival</u>

<u n="687" who="S0432">mm</u>
<u n="688" who="S0428">mm yeah</u>
<u n="689" who="S0485">which is interesting when you look at something like Homer because the Homeric epics were obviously sung the opening of the Iliad is something like sing rage oh muse</u>
<u n="690" who="S0432">mm</u>
<u n="691" who="S0485">er talk talking about the <trunc>op</trunc>pening of the Trojan war</u>

<u n="703" who="S0485">it was rather rather quaint I thought</u>
<u n="704" who="S0428">that's the kind of thing we're hoping well not that we'd be particular interested in but someone would be interested in for the in this project is we we collect all the metadata of of where people are and where they live and and then you could look up and you could <trunc>se</trunc> you could look up was you and then find all the people that have said that and you could se where they're from their age gender</u>
