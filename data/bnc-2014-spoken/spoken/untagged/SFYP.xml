<u n="3" who="S0144">won't they?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well cos I'm brush brush up on some of my theories and stuff and and we need to discuss all our dissertation work and stuff like that</u>
<u n="5" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="6" who="S0024">ah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0024">ah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0144">well we need to think of all the things involved in writing <pause dur="short"/> plus go over theories</u>
<u n="10" who="S0024">there's quite a lot to to think about</u>
<u n="11" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0024">like well you just don't don't know <pause dur="short"/> I mean is she going to talk about blended learning? Or is she gonna talk about I don't know the best way to prepare materials? What you? Like all sorts of things</u>
<u n="13" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0024">or or the materials that we've done before <pause dur="short"/> the syllabus design</u>
<u n="15" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0024">that I did with British Council</u>
<u n="17" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah I suppose so <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0024">all all of that sort of stuff</u>
<u n="19" who="S0144">yep <pause dur="short"/> I know</u>
<u n="20" who="S0024" trans="overlap">that ooh without talking about I'm gonna completely forget</u>
<u n="21" who="S0144">okay well that website you were looking at earlier</u>
<u n="22" who="S0024">which one?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0144">moodle</u>
<u n="24" who="S0024">moodle?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0024">yeah but I don't really understand Moodle</u>
<u n="27" who="S0144">yeah I had a look on their website and it and the videos were shit <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="28" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> what did I find out? I mean right it gave you like there's some <pause dur="short"/> did you log in as the trial person? The demo?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0024">logged in as the demo and it didn't really show me any</u>
<u n="31" who="S0144">no <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't very clear was it?</u>
<u n="32" who="S0024">it's just this is how you set up er questions <pause dur="short"/> but you wanted like a whole lesson</u>
<u n="33" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="34" who="S0024">demonstrated on there</u>
<u n="35" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0024">it it looks pretty new</u>
<u n="37" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0024">I'm not sure</u>
<u n="39" who="S0144">but apparently it's similar to Blackboard</u>
<u n="40" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0144">where you can</u>
<u n="42" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0144">I don't know put different classes up</u>
<u n="44" who="S0024" trans="overlap">but it looks</u>
<u n="45" who="S0144">and then put in the work that you're doing in the class put it on there for them to do as extra study</u>
<u n="46" who="S0024">yeah but do you know how many extra hours that <trunc>s</trunc> takes out of your time?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0144">what for the teacher?</u>
<u n="48" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0144">yeah quite a lot</u>
<u n="50" who="S0024">I mean I know it's better for the student <pause dur="short"/> definitely</u>
<u n="51" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah God</u>
<u n="52" who="S0024">definitely definitely</u>
<u n="53" who="S0144">yeah well as</u>
<u n="54" who="S0024">but</u>
<u n="55" who="S0144">as long as they figure this into the pay scale of these jobs</u>
<u n="56" who="S0024">the teacher needs to have some time to do that</u>
<u n="57" who="S0144">yeah you need some down time</u>
<u n="58" who="S0024">and you need to know the whole system so you can just type inn a question like de de de de de de done</u>
<u n="59" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0024">Pf like</u>
<u n="61" who="S0144">well like at the British Council like Patrick and he had that was his job doing stuff like that</u>
<u n="62" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0144">so it could almost be the teacher and then these I don't think it's fair expecting people to do both under the same job title <pause dur="short"/> although that's probably where it's gonna end up isn't it</u>
<u n="64" who="S0024">well it's alright if you have less teaching hours and then</u>
<u n="65" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0024">you've got time to put it up but</u>
<u n="67" who="S0144">yeah but you know things like this always</u>
<u n="68" who="S0024">no <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0144">get squished into your</u>
<u n="70" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="71" who="S0144">thing don't they</u>
<u n="72" who="S0024">ha</u>
<u n="73" who="S0144">it's the same with anything</u>
<u n="74" who="S0024">it can definitely be good but I er <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0024">it's basically putting a putting the lesson up <pause dur="short"/> but it's got all these different slots <pause dur="short"/> you know like</u>
<u n="77" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0024">write a question here <pause dur="short"/> and it's all about positive feedback or or giving <trunc>t</trunc> not positive immediate feedback</u>
<u n="79" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0024">so like then for say like you've got a multiple choice question</u>
<u n="81" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0024">and then you like have four you have four multiple-choice answers <pause dur="short"/> for each one you can give a feedback thing <pause dur="short"/> and whether that just is correct or</u>
<u n="83" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0024">incorrect</u>
<u n="85" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0024">or some of them</u>
<u n="87" who="S0144">and</u>
<u n="88" who="S0024">this is incorrect because la la la la la</u>
<u n="89" who="S0144">yeah and and it shows as well um like each person <trunc>s</trunc> like gets a little avatar thing</u>
<u n="90" who="S0024">oh do they? I didn't see that bit</u>
<u n="91" who="S0144">er well not an avatar but a you know just a picture <pause dur="short"/> a profile picture thing</u>
<u n="92" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh they don't get an avatar?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0144">but they're and then you can have like quizzes where you can see <pause dur="short"/> you can make it public</u>
<u n="94" who="S0024">ah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0144">so you can see which students got what right and what wrong</u>
<u n="96" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's really good <pause dur="short"/> that's really good</u>
<u n="97" who="S0144">but you can also keep it anonymous as well</u>
<u n="98" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0144">and then you can have like chat rooms for the students which is good as well</u>
<u n="100" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0144">forums where they can just post questions for anyone</u>
<u n="102" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0144">so it's yeah I think it's a brilliant thing</u>
<u n="104" who="S0024">it well it is <pause dur="short"/> it is but the all everybody need to be trained in it to</u>
<u n="105" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0024">be able to just quickly</u>
<u n="107" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0024">be able to quickly put something up at the end of each class or something</u>
<u n="109" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0024">any questions that have come up in the class might type it in</u>
<u n="111" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well if you're teaching syllabus' like the same thing comes up then it's easy</u>
<u n="112" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0144">innit <pause dur="short"/> once you've got your template then you know</u>
<u n="114" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah this is for this module <pause dur="short"/> this is for that</u>
<u n="115" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah and you can improve it every time <pause dur="short"/> but then you need to be teaching the same thing <pause dur="short"/> or have a group of teachers who you're teaching the same modules with</u>
<u n="117" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0024">well it's just collecting all the <pause dur="short"/> it's like we collect materials now <pause dur="short"/> it's just</u>
<u n="119" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0024">collect it from all the teachers</u>
<u n="121" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0024">I was thinking they're gonna have a fantastic database afterwards</u>
<u n="123" who="S0144">who?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0024">well Moodle</u>
<u n="125" who="S0144">moodle</u>

<u n="819" who="S0024">oh yeah</u>
<u n="820" who="S0144">and people are born with this mentality where they don't need any of that</u>
