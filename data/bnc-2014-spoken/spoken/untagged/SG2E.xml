<u n="1" who="S0238">yeah erm I hadn't it's not something I'd really thought about until my friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was running a vegetarian caf√© in in <pause dur="short"/> erm Scarborough for quite a while</u>
<u n="2" who="S0242">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0238">and so they had some of their dishes all of their dishes were vegetarian but some of their dishes</u>
<u n="4" who="S0242" trans="overlap">some of them were</u>
<u n="5" who="S0238">when they had V on their menu it meant vegan rather than vegetarian</u>
<u n="6" who="S0242" trans="overlap">right yeah yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0238">erm and they had gluten-free stuff and and so on erm and she actually made she made a vegan chocolate cake <pause dur="short"/> which was</u>
<u n="8" who="S0242" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="9" who="S0238">much in demand you know she'd make it to order for birthday parties and things</u>
<u n="10" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0238">because if you are a vegan it must be very difficult</u>
<u n="12" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0238">to actually er get stuff</u>
<u n="14" who="S0242">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes a festive vegan is almost an oxymoron isn't it?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="16" who="S0242"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="17" who="S0238">mm there was a programme erm well it was a Horizon <pause dur="short"/> about three weeks ago</u>
<u n="18" who="S0242">uhu</u>
<u n="19" who="S0238">but it was actually two consecutive days I think</u>
<u n="20" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="21" who="S0238">or at least two in one week erm about meat eating did you see it?</u>
<u n="22" who="S0242">no I didn't</u>
<u n="23" who="S0238">erm it was the first one was <pause dur="short"/> looking at the effects on health and the second one was looking at the effects on the environment</u>
<u n="24" who="S0242">uhu <pause dur="short"/> ah mm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0238">and to me it was very impressive because</u>
<u n="26" who="S0242" trans="overlap">I heard about this</u>
<u n="27" who="S0238">it wasn't saying <pause dur="short"/> x Y Z it was talking to lots of different people who have done different studies and some of them contradicted each other and and you know</u>
<u n="28" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="long"/> right</u>
<u n="29" who="S0238">and quite a lot of it was well actually we don't we're not quite sure about this yet</u>
<u n="30" who="S0242">right</u>
<u n="31" who="S0238">but the general consensus was <pause dur="short"/> the planet would be better if more people ate more vegetables and <unclear>fewer</unclear> less meat</u>
<u n="32" who="S0242">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0238">and most people's health would be better if they ate less meat than they do</u>
<u n="34" who="S0242">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0238" trans="overlap">in in developed countries</u>
<u n="36" who="S0242">it's a very inefficient way of feeding your population</u>
<u n="37" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="38" who="S0242">to feed them meat</u>
<u n="39" who="S0238">erm and I <pause dur="short"/> what shocked me was <pause dur="short"/> what he was talking about as an average erm amount of meat consumed by British men in a you know and so on</u>
<u n="40" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0238">and I was looking at it and thinking I eat at least that much</u>
<u n="42" who="S0242">uhu</u>
<u n="43" who="S0238">and I'm not a man</u>
<u n="44" who="S0242">right <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="45" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you know <pause dur="short"/> and I was talking to my mum and saying <pause dur="short"/> if I'm cooking for myself I don't usually bother with potatoes I'll do two veg or sometimes even three veg and a larger portion of meat</u>
<u n="46" who="S0242">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0238">than one perhaps otherwise would have therefore which is partly to compensate for the lack of potatoes and partly because you can't buy a joint for one</u>
<u n="48" who="S0242">right</u>
<u n="49" who="S0238">you know <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="50" who="S0242" trans="overlap">yes yes yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0238">erm and you know I really clearly am eating too much <pause dur="short"/> erm so it's made me think but I like fish</u>
<u n="52" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0238">and I like vegetarian food so it is a bit silly to eat as much meat as I do <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>that</unclear> I need to try and <pause dur="short"/> erm plan things a bit better <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="long"/> but it left</u>
<u n="54" who="S0242" trans="overlap">you mentioning fish I sorry I think it was the day you moved into this house and I phoned you</u>
<u n="55" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0242">and a rather breathless <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> picked up the phone because you'd just walked in the door with a large packet of fish and chips <vocal desc="laugh"/> in your hand do you remember that?</u>
<u n="57" who="S0238">mm I don't often eat fish and chips</u>
<u n="58" who="S0242">right but <pause dur="short"/> it is a suddenly it it'd been a right day for fish and chips obviously</u>
<u n="59" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I remember it now you say it I'd forgotten no I was I it left me with a lot of questions because he was <pause dur="short"/> they were differentiating between processed meat <pause dur="short"/> red meat and <pause dur="short"/> white meat IE chicken</u>
<u n="60" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> particularly in terms of health more than environment erm <pause dur="short"/> and he kept going <pause dur="short"/> processed meat for example bacon and sausage and I'm thinking well okay what about corned beef? where does where does that fit? and</u>
<u n="62" who="S0242">mm yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0238">and you know erm if you buy <pause dur="short"/> I quite often buy stuff from the er delicatessen counter in the supermarket for my sandwiches</u>
<u n="64" who="S0242">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0238">and <pause dur="short"/> okay he was clear about ham but if I'm buying cold roast pork sliced from the delicatessen is that processed or is it red meat? do you know what I mean? cos it's</u>
<u n="66" who="S0242" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0238">IE would it be better for me to roast a joint of pork and use some of it use the fag end for my sandwiches or or is it just the same as what I'm buying and and those kind of questions obviously just weren't answered at all</u>
<u n="68" who="S0242">right</u>
<u n="69" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> and not and where does where do things like duck and turkey fit it was only talking about chicken</u>
<u n="70" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0238">in contrast to beef pork and lamb</u>
<u n="72" who="S0242">right</u>
<u n="73" who="S0238">I would imagine</u>
<u n="74" who="S0242" trans="overlap">also it's <pause dur="short"/> processed meat ham I mean if you <pause dur="short"/> a ham in its simplest state is <pause dur="short"/> a piece of dead pig that you hang up <pause dur="short"/> in your hut for two years</u>
<u n="75" who="S0238">mm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="76" who="S0242">and then eat</u>
<u n="77" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0242">erm <pause dur="short"/> it it's not er most ham you would certainly buy in a supermarket there's nothing like that at all <pause dur="short"/> it's been processed here and accelerated there and so on</u>
<u n="79" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0242">but er they <pause dur="short"/> air dried cured <pause dur="short"/> lump of ham has is that really processed or not?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0238">I don't know</u>
<u n="82" who="S0242"><unclear/> you know I'm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0242">you really do just hang it up and leave it there for a erm eighteen months or so</u>
<u n="85" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well again you know so if you're buying <pause dur="short"/> meat from a farm shop for example <pause dur="short"/> how does that fit into the <pause dur="short"/> the whole</u>
<u n="86" who="S0242">right</u>
<u n="87" who="S0238">so yes it so it was looking at very general categorisations and making some general suggestions and so on but it wasn't answering those kind of detailed questions</u>
<u n="88" who="S0242">but then fair enough <unclear/></u>
<u n="89" who="S0238" trans="overlap"><unclear/> turned out to do so yeah fine</u>
<u n="90" who="S0242" trans="overlap">fine well</u>
<u n="91" who="S0238">but if you're actually think of changing your diet you actually need to know the answer to those kind of questions</u>
<u n="92" who="S0242">yeah right</u>
<u n="93" who="S0238">mm cos <pause dur="short"/> I remember <pause dur="short"/> the B and B that I used to go to near <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> they did a cooked breakfast every morning and <pause dur="short"/> that was all <pause dur="short"/> you know free range eggs and and the bacon was from some specialist farm nearby and you know it <pause dur="short"/> would that be better bacon? or is all bacon bad?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0242"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="95" who="S0238">you know <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0242">yes and another aspect of that that would interest me <pause dur="short"/> I I very seldom eat <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> sort of vegetarian meat you know <trunc>so</trunc>sausage vegetarian sausages</u>
<u n="97" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm yeah yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0242">and things like that <pause dur="short"/> but I'm gonna how much effort goes into producing that? is it <pause dur="short"/> a very <pause dur="short"/> energy intensive process to</u>
<u n="99" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="100" who="S0242">move from a soya bean</u>
<u n="101" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0242">to something that looks like a sausage</u>
<u n="103" who="S0238">they didn't look at that they when when they were looking at the environment they were mostly looking at they were looking at <pause dur="short"/> the environmental impact of <pause dur="short"/> beef <pause dur="short"/> well er mutton pork and chicken</u>
<u n="104" who="S0242">mm hm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0238">erm really and <pause dur="short"/> as he said he was not looking at things from a an animal rights point of view</u>
<u n="106" who="S0242">no no</u>
<u n="107" who="S0238">erm because actually the most <pause dur="short"/> the smallest carbon footprint was for chickens which were being raised in a big shed</u>
<u n="108" who="S0242"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="109" who="S0238">not all squashed together</u>
<u n="110" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0238">they had a bit of <unclear>legroom</unclear></u>
<u n="112" who="S0242" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="113" who="S0238">or well they were they were walking around</u>
<u n="114" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="115" who="S0238">but they were still very very concentrated and you know</u>
<u n="116" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> but it was it was I can't remember the figures now obviously but it was massively better than than any of the others</u>
<u n="118" who="S0242">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0238">and as you would expect beef was the worst lamb was nearly as bad pork was substantially less and chicken was massively less</u>
<u n="120" who="S0242">mm yep <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0238">but at one point <pause dur="short"/> he did <pause dur="short"/> compare I think he did compare a sausage and a vegetarian sausage but I think it was on the health thing and that actually there wasn't a significant difference between them on whatever they were looking at at that point</u>
<u n="122" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm mm mm</u>
<u n="123" who="S0238">which could have been saturated fats or something like that you know</u>
<u n="124" who="S0242" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="long"/> but <pause dur="short"/> clearly not a simple question each he took us to a <pause dur="short"/> a beef farm if that's the right word?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0238">in in America where you know there's not a blade of grass in sight <pause dur="short"/> they're being fed erm cereals</u>
<u n="128" who="S0242">yeah uhu</u>
<u n="129" who="S0238">erm and kept in <pause dur="short"/> I mean they're not sort of standing in rows but they're not exactly gambling free through the fields or anything</u>
<u n="130" who="S0242" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> right</u>
<u n="131" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> and er <pause dur="short"/> that was actually <pause dur="short"/> a lower carbon footprint</u>
<u n="132" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0238">a lot lower</u>
<u n="134" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0238">than having them wandering about</u>
<u n="136" who="S0242">ah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0238">because they were <pause dur="short"/> they fattened fast they reached the point when they would be slaughtered much faster</u>
<u n="138" who="S0242">yeah yep</u>
<u n="139" who="S0238">erm so they weren't <pause dur="short"/> burping methane into the atmosphere for for four years it was eighteen months that sort of difference you know</u>
<u n="140" who="S0242" trans="overlap">right right</u>
<u n="141" who="S0238">erm but on the other hand if you look at then there's other things that you're looking at so <pause dur="short"/> it depends what you what your focus is</u>
<u n="142" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm yeah yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0238">and what your priorities are</u>
<u n="144" who="S0242">yes</u>
<u n="145" who="S0238">as to what you actually think is good <pause dur="short"/> and obviously those particular because they're in America and there's no legislation there about antibiotics they're crammed with antibiotics</u>
<u n="146" who="S0242">oh yes yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0238">which of course is an issue for us</u>
<u n="148" who="S0242">right <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0238">and the the <pause dur="short"/> beef producers' answer to that question was <pause dur="short"/> more or less well there's no evidence that it's doing any harm so we might as well do it you know <vocal desc="laugh"/> rather than <pause dur="short"/> I mean you sort of thought <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> and there's certainly evidence that antibiotics that overuse of antibiotics in the world is doing harm</u>
<u n="150" who="S0242">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="151" who="S0238" trans="overlap">erm but</u>
<u n="152" who="S0242">quite right <pause dur="long"/> yes the particularly the food standards in the United States is a big <pause dur="short"/> question at the moment in Europe isn't it because</u>
<u n="153" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="154" who="S0242">there were the negotiations going on about the free trade area between North America</u>
<u n="155" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0242">and the EU <pause dur="short"/> and that may be a good idea or not but if it a lot of people are saying and I think with great justification if it means the consequence of that treaty that erm <pause dur="short"/> food raised to American standards is in is <pause dur="short"/> erm cannot be stopped from being imported into the European Union and so on then then that is a problem for a lot of people</u>
<u n="157" who="S0238">well <pause dur="short"/> I just I don't see how you could possibly justify that on any kind of legal basis but if you know if if European farmers are not allowed to do X then anybody selling within that area shouldn't be allowed to do X that's just to me that's just completely clear there <vocal desc="laugh"/> isn't any issue about that and if Americans want to conform to our standards they bloody well you know on to sell they're gonna have to conform to our standards <pause dur="short"/> tough</u>
<u n="158" who="S0242">well yes yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think I personally would agree with you completely but erm <pause dur="short"/> if <pause dur="short"/> the big picture is that the European Union will be a lot more prosperous if there is a lot more transatlantic trade and so on and if the US administration insists that that erm that opening up the market to food produce to US standards is part of a treaty</u>
<u n="159" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="160" who="S0242">then what do you do? I mean I would say <pause dur="short"/> and you say</u>
<u n="161" who="S0238">no</u>
<u n="162" who="S0242">no but</u>
<u n="163" who="S0238">call their bluff</u>
<u n="164" who="S0242">yeah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0238">cos it's time they learnt that they can't bully the rest of the world</u>
<u n="166" who="S0242"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="167" who="S0238">I mean the fact is <pause dur="short"/> that <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="long"/> we do accept goods produced in sweatshops and so on that shouldn't be you know there's not there's already a lot of question marks and I I just think you can't have those sort of double standards that's just so hypocritical we're saying that these are the only acceptable standards then we shouldn't be be allowing anything to be bought or sold that hasn't been</u>
<u n="168" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="169" who="S0238">produced according to those standards but yeah we do do it with other things</u>
<u n="170" who="S0242">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yep <pause dur="long"/> mm very good</u>
<u n="171" who="S0238">good <pause dur="long"/> ah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0242"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="173" who="S0238">yeah I mean I've yeah it's sort of</u>
<u n="174" who="S0242" trans="overlap">yeah mm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0238">it's not my normal back problem it's a pull here and that is exactly what I got the last time I tried to do that</u>
<u n="176" who="S0242" trans="overlap">uhu <unclear>mhm</unclear></u>
<u n="177" who="S0238">erm which is <trunc>wor</trunc>worrying because that means I've actually pulled something that I don't normally pull I think it's probably a particular muscle</u>
<u n="178" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="184" who="S0242">okay</u>
<u n="185" who="S0238">I am quite sure what you did last time was look at the start time say oh it'll be fine if I arrive by such and such a time and it wasn't because they're much stricter about it than you we expected</u>

<event desc="0242 leaves"/>

<u n="246" who="S0238">is it now fixed?</u>
<u n="247" who="S0242">mm mm</u>
<u n="248" who="S0238">but as you say things like that always happen <pause dur="short"/> at a point of maximum inconvenience when you really really need it with something specific</u>
<u n="249" who="S0242">yeah <pause dur="short"/> still installing update seven of twelve</u>
<u n="250" who="S0238">mm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="251" who="S0242">I mean I'll just leave it chuntering away to itself <unclear/></u>
<u n="252" who="S0238">well I wondered if it was in the middle of something when you switched it off when you were connected and it thinks it's still doing it yeah</u>
<u n="253" who="S0242" trans="overlap">yeah well last time last time I had I had it turned on it was connected</u>
<u n="254" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="255" who="S0242">that was yesterday morning</u>
<u n="256" who="S0238">but you'd think if it was in the middle of a job it would have told you as you tried to switch it off then wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="257" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="258" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="259" who="S0242">mm this is good <pause dur="short"/> this is very good</u>
<u n="260" who="S0238">well as I say I thought if I'm going to have to put up with all those brambles I might as well get <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/> at least I got some benefit</u>
<u n="261" who="S0242"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="262" who="S0238">mm I mean the only trouble obviously about leaving here at four o'clock is you're right in <pause dur="short"/> nasty traffic all the way at that time but I mean there isn't really anything you can do about that</u>
<u n="263" who="S0242">no</u>
<u n="264" who="S0238">erm oh obviously it's noticeably worse these last couple of weeks now that the schools have gone back <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="265" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="266" who="S0238">it was it's quite a shock to the system cos you get so used to it</u>
<u n="267" who="S0242">to to it not to <unclear/> school and so on yeah yeah</u>
<u n="268" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I I've never really understood this but I find that the traffic gets steadily lighter week by week from Easter onwards <pause dur="short"/> so by the time and okay yes it's very light in the summer holidays but it isn't only for those five weeks or whatever it it has been getting lighter for quite a while and then suddenly wham in September you're back to max again aren't you?</u>
<u n="269" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="270" who="S0238">the only explanation I can think of is a lot of people enough people are taking their annual holiday at any time from April to July that the number of <trunc>touc</trunc> the total number of cars on the road is is being reduced</u>
<u n="271" who="S0242">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="272" who="S0238">cos it really you know I don't think it's my imagination <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="273" who="S0242">and ah I don't know I'm sure one could <trunc>mod</trunc> ah my computer</u>
<u n="274" who="S0238">what?</u>
<u n="275" who="S0242">no no no the screen just went blank sorry but it's still it's still <unclear>loading</unclear> to update seven of twelve</u>
<u n="276" who="S0238">oh</u>
<u n="277" who="S0242">total nonsense</u>
<u n="278" who="S0238">mm mm</u>
<u n="279" who="S0242">as I'm sure people who study traffic and so on could tell us this but it could well be that let's say two percent reduction in the number of cars on the road <pause dur="short"/> results in a forty percent erm decrease in in the traffic in the in the journey time cos</u>
<u n="280" who="S0238">mm yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0242">if something is just about on the total limit if</u>
<u n="282" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="283" who="S0242">the two percent difference can make maybe an enormous difference</u>
<u n="284" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that's quite possible yes that would make sense</u>
<u n="285" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="286" who="S0238">mm I had a guy <pause dur="short"/> in one of my classes in Germany who did <pause dur="short"/> basically worked for what whatever they're called? was it N falfa you know the Munich Fecayers</u>
<u n="287" who="S0242"><unclear>N Falfo</unclear> yeah?</u>

<u n="289" who="S0242">right right</u>
<u n="290" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you know I mean I would say that's not road but erm he was he it had never really struck me until I met him that that was obviously a a real white collar job and he was very bright and needed to be</u>

<u n="292" who="S0238">to do that sort of thing that it's not exactly comparable with mending the roads <vocal desc="laugh"/> designing traffic systems and so on exactly</u>
<u n="293" who="S0242" trans="overlap">no it isn't it it it is a very complicated</u>
<u n="294" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="295" who="S0242">once <pause dur="short"/> once you sort of <pause dur="short"/> say right I am a mathematician I will model</u>
<u n="296" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="297" who="S0242">traffic and so on that's erm just the most about the most complicated model as what you can what you can manage as a mathematician <pause dur="short"/> because there are so many factors and er <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and you've got to factor in unknowns like er well an accident or whatever</u>
<u n="298" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="299" who="S0242">or somebody <pause dur="short"/> on the motorway it's down to one lane and somebody runs out of petrol just there for instance <pause dur="short"/> and is it worth having pain to have <pause dur="short"/> two pickup trucks parked by the side of a road</u>
<u n="300" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm mm mm</u>
<u n="301" who="S0242">and hanging about smoking fags doing absolutely nothing for ninety-nine point nine percent of the time but you need two trucks there because if you have two incidents erm and you've only got one truck erm then you know the whole of the M25 or the whole of the M56 or whatever can grind to a halt and</u>
<u n="302" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="303" who="S0242">and <pause dur="short"/> from the economic effect of that on the economy of Britain could be enormous</u>
<u n="304" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="305" who="S0242">because if you if you've got thousands of people arriving late for work and so on and so forth and then</u>
<u n="306" who="S0238">well and also we transport a lot of stuff on the road I mean that's something that</u>
<u n="307" who="S0242">mm mm</u>
<u n="308" who="S0238">that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> commented on that when he's been in Britain how many lorries there are on the road <pause dur="short"/> a lot of <trunc>stuf</trunc> of which stuff is transported by rail in America apparently</u>
<u n="309" who="S0242">mm yeah</u>
<u n="310" who="S0238">now I didn't think that America had such a big nail rail nail retwork rail network</u>
<u n="311" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="312" who="S0238">but maybe that's passenger you know I didn't think that people travelled by train so much I thought they did more they did drive more</u>
<u n="313" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="314" who="S0238">but <pause dur="short"/> I don't know? <pause dur="long"/> and I've certainly experienced have you watched QI?</u>
<u n="315" who="S0242">I know it but I</u>
<u n="316" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm erm cos it's something in I don't know which what letter they were doing and what they were talking about</u>
<u n="317" who="S0242" trans="overlap">uhu</u>
<u n="318" who="S0238">but there was something where they were talking about this sort of effect where on a motorway where somebody slows down for <trunc>somethin</trunc> you know puts the brakes on and they there's this sort of wave effect that goes</u>
<u n="319" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm yes</u>
<u n="320" who="S0238">that goes a really long way back and you end up</u>

<u n="324" who="S0238">is it all and I've experienced that so many times and thought what were we all slowing down for?</u>
<u n="325" who="S0242" trans="overlap">mm yes yeah yeah installing update eleven of twelve I don't know</u>
<u n="326" who="S0238">well he's doing something</u>

<u n="330" who="S0242">don't know what he's doing but he's progressing well</u>

<u n="351" who="S0242">no</u>
<u n="352" who="S0238">well isn't that a bit strange? I mean don't they normally tell you</u>
<u n="353" who="S0242">well possibly if I had had my eyes on it in the beginning it would have said Microsoft update or whatever</u>
<u n="354" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="355" who="S0242">but you know if you said good night go to bed as it were you don't then stare at your computer screen usually you just er</u>

<u n="363" who="S0242" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="364" who="S0238">erm cos what annoys me and I suppose I don't know any other way they can do it but you go into <trunc>somet</trunc> I only go into a programme when I want to use it</u>
<u n="365" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="366" who="S0238">and that's the point to which it says do you want to install an update? and well no not right now because I'm about to do something</u>
<u n="367" who="S0242" trans="overlap">I'm busy yes exactly</u>
<u n="368" who="S0238">erm and so I always say no and then of course I reach a point like I did with the Skype where it actually won't work because</u>
<u n="369" who="S0242" trans="overlap">right yeah</u>
<u n="370" who="S0238">I refuse the updates so frequently er but erm presumably a lot of people just do have their computers on with various things open? which I find weird</u>

<u n="378" who="S0238">yes but it's not so much the ow it's the fact that it that I can't get it to work that is really really annoying me</u>
<u n="379" who="S0242"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="380" who="S0238">and I shall have to stop going on about it because it's quite unconstructive to just keep on tell you how cross I am</u>

<u n="385" who="S0242" trans="overlap">okay right</u>
<u n="386" who="S0238">erm whereas actually even normal tea <pause dur="short"/> is not brilliant</u>

<u n="396" who="S0238" trans="overlap"><unclear/> try and do something try and think of something that I haven't done for you before</u>
<u n="397" who="S0242">yeah right no very good indeed</u>
<u n="398" who="S0238">so erm <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and I've actually got I've got a couple of colleagues who are vegetarian I mean one of them calls herself vegetarian but she does eat fish as well</u>
<u n="399" who="S0242">mm</u>
<u n="400" who="S0238">she's one of those erm but I still think even if somebody tells me that <pause dur="short"/> in some ways it's easier just to cook totally vegetarian</u>
<u n="401" who="S0242">yes</u>
<u n="402" who="S0238">and the last time she came there were two of them and the other one is completely vegetarian so you know</u>

<u n="404" who="S0238">so <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="405" who="S0242">some time ago we had a er well we invited four friends round for dinner and <pause dur="short"/> one couple <unclear/> two no were two couples one couple accepted but in a sense very reluctantly not reluctantly in that they didn't want to come but they said erm er but she was allergic to er and der and der and der and der and der and der</u>

<u n="408" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="409" who="S0242">erm <pause dur="short"/> and in fact it was a good job I did because then in my menu there was something which wasn't hadn't been put on the list but to which she was also <unclear/> very very allergic</u>
<u n="410" who="S0238">right yeah</u>
<u n="411" who="S0242">and so we had to have a revised list and so on erm <pause dur="short"/> but that er and I took that as a challenge and and</u>

<u n="413" who="S0242">it was really quite fun but but bloody hard work trying first of all this time to work out erm a menu as it were and and then in fact cooking things which some of which I'd never cooked before in my life</u>
<u n="414" who="S0238">good</u>
<u n="415" who="S0242">erm and <pause dur="short"/> but I I got my reward as it were because erm <pause dur="short"/> at the end of the meal she said oh that was absolutely wonderful really enjoyed that and she then told us that this was the first time she'd been out to dinner in four years</u>

<u n="419" who="S0242" trans="overlap">I remember you didn't</u>
<u n="420" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and I ended and we haven't communicated since and one of the factors there was she's a <trunc>veget</trunc> she had become a vegetarian she didn't bother to tell me before she came</u>
<u n="421" who="S0242">no</u>
<u n="422" who="S0238">so and she and she she'd just say oh well just cook what you're cooking I'll just eat the vegetables well no if you're someone who likes cooking you don't want to do it you feel awful</u>
<u n="423" who="S0242">yeah</u>

<u n="425" who="S0242">right yes yes</u>
<u n="426" who="S0238">whereas if she'd just contacted me beforehand it's not a problem <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="429" who="S0242">quite</u>
<u n="430" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> and the fact is that she was always a bit of a problem with the with you always felt rather bad because she's anorexic <pause dur="short"/> and I think that's something like being alcoholic that once you're anorexic in a sense you always are</u>
<u n="431" who="S0242">mm hm</u>
<u n="432" who="S0238">that it's kind of in your system so although she's no longer in the sort of state that she was as a teenager <pause dur="short"/> she still eats ridiculously small portions</u>

<u n="434" who="S0238">so I mean she's slightly taller than me but she we <trunc>ke</trunc> my brother and I calculated the second time she came <pause dur="short"/> so she'd be sixteenish I suppose erm and my mother happened to have a book of calories cos she was at Weight Watchers at the time</u>
<u n="435" who="S0242" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="436" who="S0238">so we knew we we calculated that she was having about seven hundred calories a day six to seven hundred calories a day and as I say she's slightly taller than me so</u>

<u n="440" who="S0238" trans="overlap">just and <pause dur="short"/> and okay she got a bit better than that but she was still not somebody who really bothered about food and stuff</u>
<u n="441" who="S0242">no</u>
<u n="442" who="S0238">it still it it's just awkward when you're the hostess but well maybe it isn't to everybody some people are much more casual about things but it it bothers me I want to get things right</u>
<u n="443" who="S0242">and I would I would certainly be annoyed if somebody arrived I mean and when they got here told me that they were you know vegetarian or allergic to gluten or whatever or whatever</u>
