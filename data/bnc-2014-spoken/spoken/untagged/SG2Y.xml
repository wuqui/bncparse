<u n="1167" who="S0493">they asked they asked</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0605">the police invited the press</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0493">no they asked</u>
<u n="1170" who="S0605">to film the</u>
<u n="1171" who="S0493">the asked for him to come in for questioning related to paedophilia and he fled the country moved became a citizen of a country with no extradition treaty</u>
<u n="1172" who="S0605">okay I didn't know that</u>
<u n="1173" who="S0493">if the police want you for questing and you don't go in and you flee the country</u>
<u n="1174" who="S0492">that's very suspicious</u>
<u n="1175" who="S0493">and he there are so many stories about him and he was so tight with all the establishment he is he is guilty as sin</u>
<u n="1176" who="S0605">but before that happened the the point of them filming the the erm what's it called where they go to your home you know the</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0603">through the keyhole</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0666"><vocal desc="laugh"/> who'd live in a house like this? you know the filming of the essentially they were knocking on his door</u>

<u n="1180" who="S0492">they do a thing where they the police release a thing that says like a fifty-three-year-old man has been arrested in in further thingy of operation <unclear/> it's like well just don't say anything until charged</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0493">public record though isn't it? you have to</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0492">really? just think like that whole thing with that poor guy in Bristol was just so awful</u>

<u n="1185" who="S0605">it's very good no it is good it is good</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0492">was just so awful</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0605">because he's not you you know he wasn't</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0604">you knew him right? the guy in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="1189" who="S0603">which guy?</u>
<u n="1190" who="S0605">he wasn't you know there wasn't one fact about him that he could be construed as guilty other than the fact that he was a <trunc>we</trunc> you know he wasn't a recluse but you know he lived on his own</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0605">fairly quiet nice gentle guy with funny hair but that was it there was no other there was nothing in his past there was nothing remotely odd other than how he looked and that's you know you know had he been black or or something or something else more visible cos he was arrested simply for how he looked and that you know that that's awful</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0603">that was the case with <trunc>n</trunc> the <trunc>go</trunc> this girl got was murdered and she was missing and they called upon</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0605">yes cos he lived in the flat down the road or down the stairs or something</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0603">yeah and apparently he was a bit weird</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0605">as I say he's he's written a book now which is a very clever book and it's about not just about his case but about how the press cos it wasn't so much the police that had him it was the Sun</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0492">but they absolutely completely crucified him</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0605">yes I think the police let them do it but it was the tabloid press that that interviewed him and almost with a thing going underneath him saying guilty you know when and they and they had no as I say no evidence he it wasn't as if he'd you know fingerprints were there from before there there was literally nothing on him other than he was a guy who lived on his own and looked a little bit funny yeah</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0604">the only thing is though yes you know of course what he went through is you now terrible and wrong but the the opposite end of it is the superinjunctions which are even sort of worse and I <trunc>me</trunc> you know I I understand why they're used but they're just abused by celebrities who don't want their extramarital affairs being news right? now that that sort of I find those really sort of erm</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0492">but don't they need to come with somebody's approval</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0604">I think they need to approval of a judge yeah</u>
<u n="1202" who="S0492">so surely the judge looks at it and says yeah do you know what it is just your private marital affairs</u>
<u n="1203" who="S0604">yeah but it it's</u>
<u n="1204" who="S0605">most of them are premiership footballers who who are gay that's what that's what the biggest superinjunctions are it's just premiership footballers who are gay and don't want other people to know they are gay cos it's going to affect their careers and affect their transfer value</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0492">but then a a judge it going to say that's because it's their human right to to privacy no?</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0604">yeah but then it's it's only the rich can afford this one thing right the the superinjunction so</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0605">yeah if you're a factory worker and you're gay you've had it you there's no way you'll get a superinjunction to cos you pay for it</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0492">but then maybe the newspapers aren't going to do a giant expose on you either are they? like they are on</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0604">well they but Clarkson Clarkson had one right? for his his affair and the I think the judge upheld it but it was still sort of leaked that it you know and I don't particularly you know it's difficult for it you know if it's in the public</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0605">well Giggs had one didn't he? Giggs famously had one</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0604">yeah <pause dur="long"/> yeah I I just don't it's it's buy it's buying silence right for people who you know I can see why</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0605">I mean if you take Clarkson right? that was obviously upheld and I think it was upheld for quite a long time what how was that in the public good?</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0605">cos all of the all of the time when he had this injunction he it was his producer wasn't it? he was going out with his <trunc>pro</trunc> he had an affair with his producer</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0492">no idea</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0605">all of this time you know for a long time after a matter of years he was still carrying on that affair knowing that the <trunc>ev</trunc> all the coming out of a nightclub and whatever all of the press knew but they he was almost laughing cos you can't say anything so it's not as if he had a secret and wanted to to give you he was flaunting that secret after that that that you know that's the bad part of it and I don't see how it can be in the public interest not to know that</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0493">how is it in the public interest to know though</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0604" trans="overlap">yeah it's the public yeah he you know his right to <trunc>pri</trunc>privacy right? that that was his argument but yeah if you're a public er</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0605">again he he he <trunc>appa</trunc>apparently made no secret of it at all</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0604">yeah</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0605">er to you know he's the type of celebrity that he's going to be in a restaurant and he's going to <trunc>ta</trunc>take a picture when when he comes out whatever he's doing whoever he is with he was just doing it that bought him the freedom to act in the way that he wanted to do continuously you know that's and that's not</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0493">well he can go out for meal with whoever he wants then</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0605">mm</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0493">he can go out for a meal with whoever he wants</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0603"><vocal desc="sigh"/> the thing is I think it's unfair to say you you're buying the silence of people you shouldn't be able to buy it it should be in the</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0493">not but privacy it's not that he's allowed to buy privacy privacy should be given to everyone regardless just cost the poor can't afford to buy it that's the problem with the system that the fact that you can buy it at all and like finance comes into it anywhere along the line</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0604">and then but yeah then you discount almost all tabloid journalism and all and</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0605">also ironically the type of thing we started the conversation by the <trunc>op</trunc>operation Yewtree type of thing there is probably superinjunctions against that</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0604">yeah</u>
<u n="1231" who="S0605">that you know I mean that's indefensible</u>
<u n="1232" who="S0604">but do you think the judges then say like we can't put it on that</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0605">let's just say that they've got a a celebrity let's say like you know Blackburn or or anyone who they the police sort of strongly suspect of doing that but without the the without the the evidence to back it up so they they they know that that he did it but they haven't got enough to do get it to a case against him if that is known then the press would probably publish that they'd publish those allegations</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0493">they shouldn't though they shouldn't if it's just an accusation and prove the guilt if it's an accusation the press shouldn't have anything to do with it</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0605">no well you were saying about Cliff Richard</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0493">yeah I was saying the police wanted to interview him and he fled to a country with no extradition treaty I don't care about the press the point is that the the police wanted to speak to him and he</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0666">is he still there?</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0493">he he can never come back to Britain without facing questions</u>

<u n="1754" who="S0492">oh no thank you</u>
<u n="1755" who="S0493">I I wouldn't be surprised if he did it but anyway the point is the point is they <unclear/> and they want it</u>
<u n="1756" who="S0603" trans="overlap">I would be surprised I he did it yeah yeah I really would be surprised if</u>
<u n="1757" who="S0604">that syringe as just one of the most amazing things I've ever seen</u>
<u n="1758" who="S0603">yeah when they actually had that film a film for that</u>
<u n="1759" who="S0493" trans="overlap">nothing happened at all from it</u>
<u n="1760" who="S0492">do you think there's a possibility that he did it</u>
<u n="1761" who="S0603">yeah maybe but also</u>
<u n="1762" who="S0604">there are certain things that aren't in the documentary</u>
<u n="1763" who="S0493" trans="overlap">he was up for sexual assault</u>
<u n="1764" who="S0492" trans="overlap">yeah it just doesn't make sense in terms of his character</u>
<u n="1765" who="S0493" trans="overlap">during the trial form another from another completely that erm you know he was done for the only thing on his record was flashing his cousin and animal cruelty he never went into it he threw a cat on fire his own cat</u>
<u n="1766" who="S0605"><unclear/> done</u>
<u n="1767" who="S0493">but he yeah he was up for he was accused twice of sexual assault once there wasn't enough evidence once was same time that he was accused of murdering and that was ongoing but obviously the murder took precedent</u>
<u n="1768" who="S0603">I've seen an interview with er his first girlfriend well his first girlfriend the one who was drink-driving</u>
<u n="1769" who="S0493">yeah</u>
<u n="1770" who="S0603">subsequently and she was like yeah he's a monster he did it</u>
<u n="1771" who="S0493">yeah</u>
<u n="1772" who="S0492">oh really?</u>
<u n="1773" who="S0603">mm</u>
<u n="1774" who="S0493">and all those letters that he wrote when he was in prison</u>
<u n="1775" who="S0603">to his first wife</u>
<u n="1776" who="S0493">I don't know I can't remember which one but I <unclear/> I'm going to kill you</u>
<u n="1777" who="S0603" trans="overlap">she was <unclear/> basically when he went down incorrectly</u>
<u n="1778" who="S0493">yeah</u>
<u n="1779" who="S0603">the first time and then she left him</u>
<u n="1780" who="S0493">yeah</u>
<u n="1781" who="S0492">it just seems my most fundamental</u>
<u n="1782" who="S0493">you think it was her brother don't you?</u>
<u n="1783" who="S0492">yeah and I said from the very beginning how suspicious I thought he was and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was like don't be so cruel don't be so cruel and I was like ninety percent</u>
<u n="1784" who="S0493">he was being weird but he was grieving but when when whatever you think about it if Steven Avery did it as a brother you need to think but the police haven't acted in the best interest of my</u>
<u n="1785" who="S0603">it's not even about Steven Avery like I don't think he's a decent human being but how the fact that his nephew got sent down</u>
<u n="1786" who="S0493">yeah that was that was the worst</u>
<u n="1787" who="S0603">like that's just that's just wrong</u>
<u n="1788" who="S0493">he didn't help himself but</u>
<u n="1789" who="S0492">no</u>
<u n="1790" who="S0603">but like that's all that's all documented</u>
<u n="1791" who="S0604">but you can explain what happened</u>
<u n="1792" who="S0603">like how can you how can you watch all of that stuff</u>
<u n="1793" who="S0493">oh it was just</u>
<u n="1794" who="S0604">well it wasn't cited correctly right they they they'd loped off that bit</u>
<u n="1795" who="S0603">at the end of the</u>
<u n="1796" who="S0493">at the end where he said of I just made it up or I'm just tired or whatever else</u>
<u n="1797" who="S0492">I never got that what would be the thing for Steven Avery to have got acquitted for something he definitely didn't do and then do something to put him back in does that just doesn't add up</u>
<u n="1798" who="S0603">and plus if he did do it he there's no way he would have been able to cover it up</u>
<u n="1799" who="S0493">no he's not the brightest spark at all</u>
<u n="1800" who="S0492">all that stuff about they seem to have completely overlook that that that if he'd killed her in the garage that blood would have gone if he cut her throat like everywhere like you can't clear that up with all that stuff that was there</u>
<u n="1801" who="S0493">yeah with the forensics they like with the test they could do to get a speck of and they look cos they were looking for it as well they would have found anything</u>
<u n="1802" who="S0603">five days or whatever</u>
<u n="1803" who="S0605">the only thing I thought about why he would do it again is that he might have thought he was immune and he could do whatever he wanted after he's done that if you're that type of daft stupid person</u>
<u n="1804" who="S0492">but I just don't think he was like that I think all those letters he sent his wife he was just</u>
<u n="1805" who="S0605" trans="overlap">but he wasn't that bright anyway</u>
<u n="1806" who="S0604" trans="overlap">well he and he had money coming right he needed that you know you don't even if you're OJ Simpson you might have nailed that</u>
<u n="1807" who="S0492" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1808" who="S0493">yeah that that him getting arrested saved the States millions</u>
<u n="1809" who="S0604">yeah</u>
<u n="1810" who="S0493">the but the lawyers were amazing Steen Stang and the other guy Jerry Boothing they were proper proper heroes</u>
<u n="1811" who="S0492" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1812" who="S0604">they were but they you know</u>
<u n="1813" who="S0605" trans="overlap">see you later guys</u>
<u n="1814" who="S0604">yeah see you dad</u>
<u n="1815" who="S0492">night</u>
<u n="1816" who="S0604">they didn't they didn't carry on after pro bono</u>
<u n="1817" who="S0493">no well they're lawyers</u>
<u n="1818" who="S0604">well yeah but some American lawyers work pro bono certainly for certain you know cases and like you know they were a clear case justifiably upset but yeah they didn't sort of say afterwards you can</u>
<u n="1819" who="S0603">but how much can you pump into that when you've got to you've got to make a living you know?</u>
<u n="1820" who="S0604">I mean I don't know I'd say I'd want to see that case to it to it's end to it's absolute legal end</u>
<u n="1821" who="S0492" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1822" who="S0603">but it was like</u>
<u n="1823" who="S0492">but isn't there something that one of them saw it with new eyes</u>
<u n="1824" who="S0493">I think they realised they did pretty much everything they could as well</u>
<u n="1825" who="S0492">yeah they wanted a new person to come and look at it with</u>
<u n="1826" who="S0493">also like with that documentary his case like whatever lawyer takes that and if they do work for free like that's a career case as well because it's just everyone in the world knows about it everybody it's massive so the one the lawyer he's got now she does she's not going to get a penny from it directly but she won't have to work if she does half a decent job she won't have to work for the rest of her life</u>
<u n="1827" who="S0603">well if she get them off the hook</u>
<u n="1828" who="S0493">especially if she gets them off</u>
<u n="1829" who="S0603">the amount of appeals and stuff that they've had already and</u>
<u n="1830" who="S0493">yeah yeah it's</u>
<u n="1831" who="S0492">the whole thing was a bit and then at the end where he like turned up and he'd got himself a new</u>
<u n="1832" who="S0604"><trunc>gi</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="1833" who="S0492">girlfriend</u>
<u n="1834" who="S0603">I just I just think his nephew needs to be let out</u>
<u n="1835" who="S0492">yeah that's really sad</u>
<u n="1836" who="S0603">I mean I'm not saying that he did he did it but that's the most unjust thing about watching that show was looking at how they treated that kid</u>
<u n="1837" who="S0493">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1838" who="S0492">there's something definitely suspicious</u>
<u n="1839" who="S0493" trans="overlap">like oh it was madness as well like if they if apparently like cos I read a few things around the case that they didn't show in the documentary it was a flawed documentary in some senses but like the family were not just a pain in the arse they were like made life hell for the community and they were <trunc>dis</trunc>despised not just out of snobbery like they were just a pain in the arse they were getting rammed but like <trunc>a</trunc>and Steven Avery embarrassed the court and the system publically they he he demanded loads like there was a thirty-five million or whatever I can't remember loads of money</u>
<u n="1840" who="S0604">but I but I wouldn't say <trunc>un</trunc>unfairly</u>
<u n="1841" who="S0493">no no no I'm not saying but anyway he embarrassed them and he was a thorn in their side and you can understand why they wanted to get one over on him and if something that happened and they could pin him on and he was up for sexual assault and they they knew kind of unofficially or the word on the street was that he did this <unclear/> you can understand in a way why they did that but that kid that what's his name the nineteen-year-old</u>
<u n="1842" who="S0603">Brandon?</u>
<u n="1843" who="S0493">Brandon just a completely gullible innocent poor</u>
<u n="1844" who="S0603">it just seems like why why why bring him why?</u>
<u n="1845" who="S0493">what dangers</u>
<u n="1846" who="S0604">the thing is it's substantiated</u>
<u n="1847" who="S0603">yeah</u>
<u n="1848" who="S0493">but it didn't because</u>
<u n="1849" who="S0604">well it did</u>
<u n="1850" who="S0493">no because when they were doing some of the when they were saying like they had three counts he was up for they they did it didn't make sense that it would be two out of three it's either three out of three or zero</u>
<u n="1851" who="S0604">that was only later you know once once they had him in locked in they can't you know they couldn't take back those ones he had already admitted right you can't sort of no now that you're no longer useful to us that case was already in motion</u>
<u n="1852" who="S0603" trans="overlap">it's er it's just weird</u>
<u n="1853" who="S0493">that's vindictive though isn't it?</u>
<u n="1854" who="S0603">I mean it's as a documentary they they've put their they put their point across very very well</u>
<u n="1855" who="S0493">yeah but they were bias like</u>
<u n="1856" who="S0603">it's a documentary like it shows it shows what what a documentary wants to show like</u>
<u n="1857" who="S0493">and it it's difficult it's difficult</u>
<u n="1858" who="S0604">it's it's relevant that he's up for sexual assault <trunc>ch</trunc> change and that should be in there</u>
<u n="1859" who="S0603" trans="overlap">oh yeah no but that doesn't but then they put that in the documentary the <trunc>do</trunc> then the documentary doesn't look as good</u>
<u n="1860" who="S0493">it still look it's still questionable that he did it and you can still see that they faked evidence</u>
<u n="1861" who="S0604">yeah I I still I think they wanted just that case to be judged on merit alone</u>
<u n="1862" who="S0603" trans="overlap">they painted they painted the picture</u>
<u n="1863" who="S0492">mm</u>
<u n="1864" who="S0604">you know the <trunc>ca</trunc> <trunc>thca</trunc> the proceedings of those case</u>
<u n="1865" who="S0493">well they talked about him chucking the cat on or the cat</u>
<u n="1866" who="S0492">yeah that was near to the first case cos that's they think that was the reason why the woman blamed her <trunc>co</trunc> her cousin blamed him</u>
<u n="1867" who="S0493">but then but then you went it's completely undermined with evidence come to light that they didn't mention which is going to happen on the internet and and then you question other things</u>
<u n="1868" who="S0604">yeah and yeah no I agree it probably should have been in there but if they were purposely sort of wanting to focus on the case and the case alone then yeah</u>
<u n="1869" who="S0492">I never understood why they had so much video footage</u>
<u n="1870" who="S0603">I was just going to say that like how like at what point did they jump on this?</u>
<u n="1871" who="S0492" trans="overlap">everything yeah</u>
<u n="1872" who="S0604">well they jumped on it</u>
<u n="1873" who="S0493">a lot of it was achieved stuff from the first trial wasn't it?</u>
<u n="1874" who="S0604">yeah I think it as the first him being let out that was that</u>
<u n="1875" who="S0603">so they built it up into a story</u>
<u n="1876" who="S0604">and they were there on it they were probably doing</u>
<u n="1877" who="S0492">it was so much recorded though</u>
<u n="1878" who="S0604">they but they were probably doing the documentary of just him and and the false you know getting</u>
<u n="1879" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<u n="1880" who="S0604">and just <trunc>ge</trunc> doing the back story for that and then thinking that's all their story and then suddenly he's a arrested</u>
<u n="1881" who="S0603" trans="overlap">so we're going to do a documentary about this guy who got done</u>
<u n="1882" who="S0604">yeah and then suddenly they got yeah</u>
<u n="1883" who="S0492">but they but they seem to have <trunc>re</trunc> they almost like any interaction that happened ever they were saying</u>
<u n="1884" who="S0493">don't you think it was the timing of it as well so you had local news reports that from the eighties and nineties that would be archived more substantially from the first time in any point in human history then you had the birth of camcorders in say like the mid early nineties so you could have camcorder footage</u>
<u n="1885" who="S0603" trans="overlap">cos there was people there was all the footage of people going out to researchers and stuff and there was just camcorders everywhere wasn't there?</u>
<u n="1886" who="S0493">yeah and it was just weir dhow they found their oh just like the search thing was weird as well</u>
<u n="1887" who="S0603">the brother and the ex-boyfriend</u>
<u n="1888" who="S0604" trans="overlap">that was</u>
<u n="1889" who="S0492">honestly there was definitely something suspicious about them</u>
<u n="1890" who="S0493" trans="overlap">the boyfriend the boyfriend like not the boyfriend the brother like you has a duty to find out the truth you need like why was he so defensive of the police? and saying how much he loved them and whatever when even if you think it was Avery you'd go maybe he was grateful that they went out of their way to get the man he thought was the right man</u>
<u n="1891" who="S0603">yeah you're blinded by that sometimes</u>
<u n="1892" who="S0604">to give him <trunc>be</trunc>benefit of the doubt it's a it it affords peace of mind right? if it's not this if it's not Avery then that means the guy is in the ring</u>
<u n="1893" who="S0603">well yeah but like that's the other thing</u>
<u n="1894" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<u n="1895" who="S0604">and you sort of got to double down every sort of like</u>
<u n="1896" who="S0603" trans="overlap">so then you're like who got her</u>
<u n="1897" who="S0493" trans="overlap">it was just it was just like an all American jock <unclear/> anyway</u>
<u n="1898" who="S0492" trans="overlap">it's definitely somebody in the in the story that did it</u>
<u n="1899" who="S0603">yeah</u>
<u n="1900" who="S0492">there was something a bit weird about Brandon's older brother and step dad</u>
<u n="1901" who="S0604">there was something a bit weird about all of them</u>
<u n="1902" who="S0603">they were all weird</u>
<u n="1903" who="S0492">yeah but some of them really didn't</u>
<u n="1904" who="S0493">and he testified the things that we know didn't happen and he's got a a attack record as long as your arm as well and he wasn't family</u>
<u n="1905" who="S0492" trans="overlap">and the brother delete and the brother deleted her answerphone messages</u>
<u n="1906" who="S0603">yeah</u>
<u n="1907" who="S0493">and that was never like</u>
<u n="1908" who="S0492">and he was just like oh yeah I just guessed at what her password was I would just say I knew her password because</u>
<u n="1909" who="S0493">but he deleted them and there was no other way that they got deleted when the person who rang they like they know nothing was followed up at all</u>
<u n="1910" who="S0604">he was creepy as well</u>
<u n="1911" who="S0603">yeah so many creepy things in that like all of that show you just like there's some weird people</u>
<u n="1912" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<u n="1913" who="S0603">and they're all involved in this shit and the horrible prosecutor</u>
<u n="1914" who="S0493">ah</u>
<u n="1915" who="S0492">I <trunc>lov</trunc> I wanted him to get his comeuppance</u>
<u n="1916" who="S0493" trans="overlap">creepy</u>
<u n="1917" who="S0492">I'd have never imagined in a million years it was going to be from him being like fucking sex pest</u>

<u n="1923" who="S0493" trans="overlap">but he he drove it as well didn't he? he really enjoyed the fact that he was sending a man down</u>
<u n="1924" who="S0492">and he never stood up that would bother me</u>
<u n="1925" who="S0603">a kid a sixteen year old kid</u>

<u n="1936" who="S0493">I thought the journalist was pretty savvy I thought they sorted through quite a lot of it and I thought that was going to be a big case that one of the attractive female ones was going to like break find new evidence or whatever I thought that was the way it's going to go but by about episode seven you're like this is not going to end well</u>
<u n="1937" who="S0603">no way yeah you're like</u>
<u n="1938" who="S0492">it was quite bleak as well that by the episode nine it was all wrapped up and you're like what the fuck is this last episode going to be</u>
