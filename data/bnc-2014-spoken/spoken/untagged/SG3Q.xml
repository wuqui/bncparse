<u n="1289" who="S0058">yeah but it cooks it though</u>
<u n="1290" who="S0026">not really</u>
<u n="1291" who="S0058">so</u>
<u n="1292" who="S0026">you just marinade is like before you cook it you soak it in some sauce or something don't you <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="1293" who="S0179">yes and you <unclear/></u>
<u n="1294" who="S0058">yes but it's basically the meat is cooking in the sauce for</u>

<u n="1296" who="S0026">yeah</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="1298" who="S0179">so but does the slow cooker do the same? Or is it just on the surface?</u>

<u n="1300" who="S0026">what do you mean on the surface?</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="1302" who="S0058">well it's in the sauce for that long</u>
<u n="1303" who="S0026">it's just a slow cooker is just like a huge pot <pause dur="short"/> a deep pot</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0026">that warms up to maybe you know eighty or ninety degrees and sits there for eight hours</u>

<u n="1312" who="S0179">actually I'm sceptical about casseroles and stews because you er well for example your mother</u>

<u n="1314" who="S0179">has this knack of ruining perfectly nice meat</u>

<u n="1317" who="S0026">right <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1318" who="S0058">but she also cooks everything</u>

<u n="1321" who="S0026">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no I mean you don't put  you don't put  I mean things like crispy green vegetables you only put them in</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0026">for like the last fifteen minutes or something <pause dur="short"/> just to warm them up <pause dur="short"/> rather than stewing them for twelve hours</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well was it</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0179">not if you're her mother</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0058">I had someone who had some</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0026">well I made a  I made a  Thai curry in there and it was actually really good <pause dur="short"/> cos normally you just stir fry stuff</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0026">for Thai curries <pause dur="short"/> but it makes it very differently <pause dur="short"/> it's um</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0026">it's pretty nice</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0058">I had something er was it  was it  neck? It think it was lamb neck that she'd bought <pause dur="short"/> and it was really cheap and stuck it in and that was really good</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0026">and stuff like lentils as well <pause dur="short"/> cos lentils have to be soaked anyway</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0058">mm</u>

<u n="1344" who="S0179">I always thought lentils were a carbohydrate source</u>
<u n="1345" who="S0026">they are <pause dur="short"/> they're also a very good protein source <pause dur="short"/> like all pulses <pause dur="short"/> like haricot beans and kidney beans are also good protein sources for vegetarians</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0058">you're just biased cos your dad's a massive lentil fan</u>

<u n="1356" who="S0179">why?</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0026">Cos I just think ecologically it's more of a sustainable way of eating</u>
<u n="1358" who="S0179">fair enough</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="2583" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="2584" who="S0179">one helps the other <pause dur="short"/> so I've very strong legs but I very rarely do weights with them <pause dur="short"/> it's just cos of running <pause dur="short"/> and er to be fair that's where a fair amount of my chest strength comes from</u>
<u n="2585" who="S0026">yeah you do get  you do get  some from but the most effective way to get stronger is to lift heavier weights <pause dur="short"/> cos that is the <trunc>def</trunc></u>

<u n="2591" who="S0026">but sprint trainers always do heavy weights <pause dur="short"/> because that's the only way they can get strong enough to compete with other very <trunc>str</trunc> strong sprinters</u>
<u n="2592" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> I know</u>
<u n="2593" who="S0026">sprinters do have very strong legs I admit</u>

<u n="2597" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="2598" who="S0179">does come it's not all from the weights <pause dur="short"/> a lot of that comes from the running</u>
<u n="2599" who="S0026">but that's more power rather than strength</u>

<u n="2602" who="S0179">but alright</u>
<u n="2603" who="S0026">no there is a  there is a  distinction though</u>
<u n="2604" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="2605" who="S0026">Cos power is effectively how fast you can lift the weight</u>

<u n="2613" who="S0026">not about how fast you can lift the weight <pause dur="short"/> it's about strength <pause dur="short"/> it should really be called strength lifting <unclear/></u>

<u n="2780" who="S0026">no I don't think they say that <pause dur="short"/> I think they say we think marathons are boring <pause dur="short"/> and I agree with them <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't ever do a marathon <pause dur="short"/> I can appreciate people who do but it's not really my scene <pause dur="short"/> I appreciate that you have to be incredibly fit to do one</u>
<u n="2781" who="S0179">I think it it well no I think um yeah you have to have a very you need to be a good marathon runner you need like like if you lined up a load of runners I could spot the marathon runners <pause dur="short"/> just from their body type <pause dur="short"/> as in you have</u>
<u n="2782" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/></u>

<u n="2785" who="S0179">basically you need to be as light as possible <pause dur="short"/> cos that makes each step so much easier <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> it's disturbing if you look at how thin some of them are <pause dur="short"/> like just the legs <pause dur="short"/> you expect <pause dur="short"/> anyway um</u>
<u n="2786" who="S0058">oh you can put that on the hob if you want</u>
<u n="2787" who="S0179">but um I dunno it's just like some of the obstacles like running through an electrified field <pause dur="short"/> why?</u>

<u n="2791" who="S0179">like er like some of the things are just like if they just took like a military assault course fine <pause dur="short"/> but some of these things are just like designed to inflict pain for no good reason <pause dur="short"/> I mean I like pain like the next man but it</u>
<u n="2792" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="2867" who="S0026">yeah</u>
<u n="2868" who="S0120">site <pause dur="short"/> um so there's the control building and there's the there's two pump kiosks</u>

<u n="2876" who="S0058">so <unclear/></u>
<u n="2877" who="S0120">fucking big thing though <pause dur="short"/> one and a half metres deep</u>

<u n="2898" who="S0120">um <pause dur="short"/> but it'll be nice eventually to see all the my design in the ground</u>
<u n="2899" who="S0058">in a road <pause dur="short"/> yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="2900" who="S0120">not that many weeks' time I guess</u>
<u n="2901" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="2902" who="S0120"><unclear/> it's er parts of it are a bit of a build er build and design situation rather than a design and build situation</u>
<u n="2903" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> What what so they're building it first?</u>
<u n="2904" who="S0026"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2905" who="S0120">well it's almost that</u>
<u n="2906" who="S0026"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2907" who="S0120">it's so tight</u>
<u n="2908" who="S0058">oh right <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="2909" who="S0120">um</u>
<u n="2910" who="S0058">so they've got <unclear/></u>
<u n="2911" who="S0120">they're trying to get it done A S A F P</u>

<u n="2914" who="S0120">um <pause dur="short"/> and er</u>
<u n="2915" who="S0058">oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="2916" who="S0120">it's kind of er a bit construction's happening in parallel with design</u>
<u n="2917" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2918" who="S0120">and er they're</u>
<u n="2919" who="S0026"></u>
<u n="2920" who="S0120">using us</u>
<u n="2921" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> No</u>

<u n="2923" who="S0026">mm</u>
<u n="2924" who="S0120">it's not that terrible <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's not  situation</u>
<u n="2925" who="S0026">well it's er it's good in that you can sort of feed back things that need to be done like instantly <pause dur="short"/> that that</u>
<u n="2926" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="2927" who="S0026">you might otherwise have kind of finalized design and you'd never have thought of it until you started building it</u>
<u n="2928" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="2929" who="S0026">but</u>
<u n="2930" who="S0120">um</u>
<u n="2931" who="S0026">it's not often that you have a situation where</u>
<u n="2932" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2933" who="S0026">design can't be finalized properly <pause dur="short"/> you know just</u>
<u n="2934" who="S0120">mm <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's like</u>
<u n="2935" who="S0026"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2936" who="S0120">we we design the pipework and send that to the the pipework fabrication subcontractor</u>
<u n="2937" who="S0026">right</u>
<u n="2938" who="S0120">who then develops as build drawings about how they plan to make it <pause dur="short"/> so they might you know weld and a bunch of stuff</u>
<u n="2939" who="S0026">yeah</u>
<u n="2940" who="S0120">instead of necessarily taking different sections and</u>
<u n="2941" who="S0026">yeah</u>
<u n="2942" who="S0120">bolting them together</u>
<u n="2943" who="S0026">yeah</u>
<u n="2944" who="S0120">or whatever <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> and we just take those proposed joins and comment on them and blah blah blah and make sure that they're alright <pause dur="short"/> and then once they're fixed and it's alright you know that's what's gonna be used <pause dur="short"/> and then we use their fabrication drawings and our main layout drawing <unclear/> worked in</u>
<u n="2945" who="S0058">um</u>
<u n="2946" who="S0120">for example</u>
<u n="2947" who="S0058">ah</u>
<u n="2948" who="S0120">reasonably interesting <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> how about you?</u>
<u n="2949" who="S0026">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>w</trunc> work's alright <pause dur="short"/> I've got um</u>
<u n="2950" who="S0120"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2951" who="S0026">yeah I've <trunc>g</trunc> I'm really enjoying working there <pause dur="short"/> we've I've got um sort of kind of got three projects on at the moment <pause dur="short"/> one of them is one that I started when I first started <pause dur="short"/> it's like a research project</u>
<u n="2952" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="2953" who="S0026">and the company's finally decided they want to stump up for this bit of kit</u>
<u n="2954" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="2955" who="S0026">which would kind of validate my research</u>
<u n="2956" who="S0120">oh excellent</u>
<u n="2957" who="S0026">er so if we get this bit of kit we can do lots of <trunc>con</trunc> like it's it's control loop modelling my research project <pause dur="short"/> so a lot of the control loop for a a power circuit</u>
<u n="2958" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="2959" who="S0026">and um but you can't test if my theory's correct if <trunc>m</trunc> my model is right until you get this bit of kit <pause dur="short"/> and they're like oh we'll go and buy this bit of kit now <pause dur="short"/> not because of what I'd but because they decided we needed it anyway <pause dur="short"/> so I'm going back to that project <pause dur="short"/> I'm not doing it for a few months <pause dur="short"/> when we get this bit of kit <pause dur="short"/> I've got another one which is like reverse engineering <pause dur="short"/> which is really weird <pause dur="short"/> where a Japanese car manufacturer has asked us to work out how a European competitor vehicle</u>
<u n="2960" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2961" who="S0026">um does</u>
<u n="2962" who="S0120"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2963" who="S0026">does er does its safety features</u>
<u n="2964" who="S0058">nice</u>
<u n="2965" who="S0026">so we bought a VW Polo</u>
<u n="2966" who="S0120"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2967" who="S0026">and it's a really good one <pause dur="short"/> it's a GTI <pause dur="short"/> so it's like stupidly powerful <pause dur="short"/> a hundred and eighty-three horsepower engine</u>
<u n="2968" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="2969" who="S0058"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2970" who="S0026">well a proper boy racer car <unclear/> tiny little car</u>
<u n="2971" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2972" who="S0026">and we've just I've just been like taking it apart and like logging loads of data</u>
<u n="2973" who="S0058">cool</u>
<u n="2974" who="S0026">um plotting it in MATLAB and doing analysis and stuff like that <pause dur="short"/> so that's kind of</u>
<u n="2975" who="S0120">sounds pretty awesome</u>
<u n="2976" who="S0026">it's quite basic stuff <pause dur="short"/> it's pretty basic stuff but I've actually learnt a bit about how an engine works <pause dur="short"/> cos I didn't really know</u>
<u n="2977" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="2978" who="S0026">much about mechanical stuff before that</u>
<u n="2979" who="S0120">you actually get to take stuff apart and play with</u>
<u n="2980" who="S0026">yeah <pause dur="short"/> nice</u>
<u n="2981" who="S0120">play with gadgets <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="2982" who="S0026">and my other project which is starting on Monday is a European funded project to do with thermo-electric generators <pause dur="short"/> so there's some</u>
<u n="2983" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="2984" who="S0026">like EU funded thing to work out if it's worthwhile putting these generators on the tail-pipes of trucks like exhaust-pipes <pause dur="short"/> so you run a heat engine well it's not really a it is a heat engine it's like a</u>
<u n="2985" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="2986" who="S0026">electrical solid state type thing between a hot source which is the exhaust gas and a cold source which is the engine coolant <pause dur="short"/> and try and charge up a battery <pause dur="short"/> so they're hybrid trucks <pause dur="short"/> that they're proposing</u>
<u n="2987" who="S0120">right</u>
<u n="2988" who="S0026">um and we're like a subcontractor for one of the main people <unclear/></u>
<u n="2989" who="S0120">is the engine sort of really the coolest thing?</u>
<u n="2990" who="S0026">well it it is a reservoir</u>
<u n="2991" who="S0120">oh okay</u>
<u n="2992" who="S0026">I mean the only other thing you could use is air</u>
<u n="2993" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="2994" who="S0026">but it's not like easy enough to transfer to <unclear/></u>
<u n="2995" who="S0120">right</u>
<u n="2996" who="S0026">it'll be typically be ninety degrees <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> the exhaust gases could be like pre-catalytic converter they could be like four hundred degrees or something</u>
<u n="2997" who="S0120">oh right</u>
<u n="2998" who="S0026">there's enough of a differential to use the engine cooler as yeah</u>
<u n="2999" who="S0120">right</u>
<u n="3000" who="S0026">as the cold source <pause dur="short"/> apparently <pause dur="short"/> I mean I don't know anything about the <trunc>ther</trunc> thermodynamics but I think the stuff that I'm gonna be doing is like modelling probably in MATLAB the they want  they want  a one D thermo-electric model <pause dur="short"/> and I don't even know anything about this yet cos it's kicking off tomorrow <pause dur="short"/> well like our first meeting <pause dur="short"/> er on <unclear/> on Monday <pause dur="short"/> so I don't really know but it sounds pretty interesting</u>
<u n="3001" who="S0120">yeah <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="3002" who="S0026">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm quite  I'm quite  enjoying it <pause dur="short"/> quite a lot of different stuff going on so <unclear/></u>
