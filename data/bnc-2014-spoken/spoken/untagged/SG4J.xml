<u n="493" who="S0024">you've gotta be prepared with your girl guide thing and your compass</u>

<u n="503" who="S0024">you can usually tell where the sun is can't you? At night I find it a bit harder because I know some stars are like those planets and stuff some of them you know</u>
<u n="504" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="505" who="S0024">but that depends on the time of year</u>

Anyway yeah they're they're quite well set up especially with the coal and the wood and I'd like to do and they're doing all the vegetables <pause dur="short"/> but they're still not living living off the land are they?</u>

<u n="675" who="S0024">no and because her credit rating is quite high because er you know they didn't er they borrowed money before or they haven't had work in England for a while</u>
<u n="676" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="677" who="S0024">their credit rating is quite low <pause dur="short"/> so she said that er the interest is quite high <pause dur="short"/> so I was thinking but why of all the solutions to like travel the world for ten years working working working <pause dur="short"/> to come back to England <pause dur="short"/> spend all your savings <pause dur="short"/> then be looking for land to buy and they've just come back and spent fifteen grand in two months</u>
<u n="678" who="S0144">what?</u>
<u n="679" who="S0024">I mean that <pause dur="short"/> well that was their savings wasn't it? <pause dur="short"/> it's just whittled away by going out to dinner and stuff like that <pause dur="short"/> you know how it whittles away</u>
<u n="680" who="S0144">well yeah</u>
<u n="681" who="S0024">and a lot of it got taken up when the cat was sick and they when they moved all their stuff back on the boat <pause dur="short"/> that was a few thousand pounds</u>
<u n="682" who="S0144">mm mm</u>
<u n="683" who="S0024">like to get all their stuff back on the boat <pause dur="short"/> and they've used up all their money <pause dur="short"/> but she's she's she worked at the school this week actually</u>
<u n="684" who="S0144">hmm</u>

<u n="688" who="S0144" trans="overlap">that's gotta be pretty damn high</u>
<u n="689" who="S0024">I though I mean I mean they've got loans before but that's irrelevant because now how they do it with the loans now is like all of the high interest rates they just get you</u>
<u n="690" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="691" who="S0024">and it's just a payment every month</u>
<u n="692" who="S0144">well it's just a</u>
<u n="693" who="S0024">but she's tying herself down to British society</u>
<u n="694" who="S0144">loans are for suckers aren't they? I mean</u>
<u n="695" who="S0024">yeah and I'd</u>
<u n="696" who="S0144">I thought people had woken up to that in general</u>
<u n="697" who="S0024">yeah me too</u>
<u n="698" who="S0144">I thought them especially would stay <pause dur="short"/> it wouldn't even cross their minds</u>
<u n="699" who="S0024" trans="overlap">them especially <pause dur="short"/> especially <pause dur="short"/> I didn't think</u>
<u n="700" who="S0144">take a grand loan</u>
<u n="701" who="S0024">I didn't think it would</u>
<u n="702" who="S0144">Cos they'll be paying back like fifteen grand at least <pause dur="short"/> wouldn't they?</u>
<u n="703" who="S0024">yep <pause dur="short"/> and they got it all over the internet <pause dur="short"/> they didn't go and see a financial person or anything like that <pause dur="short"/> just got it all over the internet <pause dur="short"/> and Claire was</u>
<u n="704" who="S0144">well</u>
<u n="705" who="S0024">even <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> herself was like God I didn't think they'd give me a loan because of my credit rating but</u>
<u n="706" who="S0144" trans="overlap">huh <pause dur="short"/> oh they're so nice</u>
<u n="707" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's almost how it was <pause dur="short"/> I was I was <unclear/></u>
<u n="708" who="S0144" trans="overlap">oh they gave me all this money</u>
<u n="709" who="S0024">Cos if they <pause dur="short"/> beware of the bull <pause dur="short"/> where's the bull?</u>
<u n="710" who="S0144">oh great</u>
<u n="711" who="S0024">can you see it? But oh can you believe it? What are we gonna say to them? Because I really disagree and I think they should get</u>
<u n="712" who="S0144">well it's their choice <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="713" who="S0024">yeah but I don't want them to get in a muddle</u>
<u n="714" who="S0144">well</u>
<u n="715" who="S0024" trans="overlap">can you imagine if we come back next time and they're all in a muddle</u>
<u n="716" who="S0144">mm it does seem a bit foolish I have to say <pause dur="short"/> there's that um cos I was gonna lend money on that site</u>
<u n="717" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="718" who="S0144">um <pause dur="short"/> that it's like a peer to peer lending site</u>
<u n="719" who="S0024">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="720" who="S0144">where the the interest rates are a lot lower than the bank <pause dur="short"/> I've forgotten what it was called</u>
<u n="721" who="S0024">ah you see we should have told them about that</u>
<u n="722" who="S0144">and then you can choose to pay it back over one two or three years or something</u>
<u n="723" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="724" who="S0144">and it's literally the interest rates are half of that of the bank</u>
<u n="725" who="S0024">are we still gonna do that?</u>
<u n="726" who="S0144">no cos I thought with the economy about to crash then</u>
<u n="727" who="S0024">it wouldn't be any good?</u>
<u n="728" who="S0144">you wouldn't get your er money back</u>
<u n="729" who="S0024">ah</u>
<u n="730" who="S0144">but I like the idea of cutting out the banks and all of these loan sharks</u>
<u n="731" who="S0024">well they've got two weeks to go back on the loan</u>
<u n="732" who="S0144">and doing it person to person <pause dur="short"/> that's a nice idea</u>
<u n="733" who="S0024">well I think I'll tell her about that <pause dur="short"/> I forgot <trunc>com</trunc> all about that</u>
<u n="734" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but you should set that kind of thing up locally</u>
<u n="735" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="736" who="S0144">like in your in your village <pause dur="short"/> if you've got a small like community</u>
<u n="737" who="S0024">mm I hope they'll be alright</u>
<u n="738" who="S0144">that'd be nice to do</u>
<u n="739" who="S0024">it would be</u>
<u n="740" who="S0144">Cos that's that's what</u>
<u n="741" who="S0024">but that's how a bank started isn't it? And then they just get power hungry and just like <pause dur="short"/> isn't that how it started?</u>
<u n="742" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but that's what erm you know that's what a lot of these families do <pause dur="short"/> that's what Chinese families do especially</u>
<u n="743" who="S0024">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="744" who="S0144">they look after the family <pause dur="short"/> you know they lend each other money</u>

<u n="748" who="S0024">up</u>
<u n="749" who="S0144">you know but even if they do and they charge a lot less than the the best rates out there then you know that's how they they build their families up</u>
