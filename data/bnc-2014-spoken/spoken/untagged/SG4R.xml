<u n="10" who="S0530">damn</u>
<u n="11" who="S0529">oh <pause dur="short"/> and I dunno what I'm gonna do really like <pause dur="short"/> about this week</u>
<u n="12" who="S0530">what are you feeling <pause dur="short"/> about it right now like?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0529">I dunno like I just <pause dur="short"/> it's difficult cos I've had the whole week off <pause dur="short"/> so it's kind of given I've I've literally had like seven days off and given me like a load of kind of <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> like a lack or <pause dur="short"/> almost caring about it <pause dur="short"/> really like I haven't really been thinking about</u>
<u n="14" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="15" who="S0529">this week <pause dur="short"/> as going back to <pause dur="short"/> you know being at uni and <pause dur="short"/> being part of a <pause dur="short"/> you know like education environment it's just not really occurring to me yet</u>
<u n="16" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0529">and I'm just a bit worried about Tuesdays</u>
<u n="18" who="S0530">what's <pause dur="short"/> on Tuesday?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0529" trans="overlap">erm <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> <unclear>there's</unclear> an art seminar</u>
<u n="20" who="S0530">oh <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0529">yeah cos I've never been one <vocal desc="laugh"/> and <pause dur="short"/> I dunno if I'm going to start going to them or just kind of like <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>yeah I explained it before</unclear></u>
<u n="22" who="S0530" trans="overlap">I mean if you can if you feel able to</u>
<u n="23" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="24" who="S0530">I think <pause dur="short"/> it would be a good idea <pause dur="short"/> because</u>
<u n="25" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0530">after the half term <pause dur="short"/> I think if there's any moment <pause dur="short"/> that you can feel <pause dur="short"/> you'd mentally be able to jump back in it's <pause dur="short"/> this week after the break</u>
<u n="27" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> no I agree</u>
<u n="28" who="S0530" trans="overlap">and obviously it it doesn't work out <pause dur="short"/> if it doesn't work out then you'll know then <pause dur="short"/> but if you don't go back <pause dur="short"/> after this week if you just like</u>
<u n="29" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0530">what if I had <pause dur="short"/> turned it around that week? <pause dur="short"/> sort of thing you know?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="32" who="S0530">and I know it's really really hard to actually</u>
<u n="33" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="sigh"/> <event desc="sound of raspberry"/> <pause dur="short"/> I just really don't know how to turn it around</u>
<u n="34" who="S0530"><vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0529">it feels like an insurmountable problem <pause dur="short"/> and then it</u>
<u n="36" who="S0529" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0529">but it's fine</u>
<u n="38" who="S0530">no I think you'll be able to do it <pause dur="short"/> if you <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>I</trunc>if you've just focused on getting <pause dur="short"/> not even focusing on <pause dur="short"/> trying to work at the moment just say it's a challenge for you to get there because it is a moment to be attending</u>
<u n="39" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0530">so I'd focus on that <pause dur="short"/> and then when you can <pause dur="short"/> maybe focus on actually like <pause dur="short"/> I take it one step at a time <pause dur="short"/> like first start going <pause dur="short"/> second step actually start <pause dur="short"/> being able to <pause dur="short"/> take stuff in <pause dur="short"/> in the lectures and the seminars</u>
<u n="41" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0530">maybe the next step doing independent work <pause dur="short"/> you don't have to go above and beyond you don't have to do <pause dur="short"/> you know a <trunc>m</trunc> something <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> incredible you don't have to produce <pause dur="short"/> first <pause dur="short"/> pieces of work you don't have to do that <pause dur="short"/> it's just about <pause dur="short"/> cos that's the thing with you cos I don't think you're used to like <pause dur="short"/> doing the minimum kind of thing you're used to doing really well and wanting to do really well</u>
<u n="43" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><unclear>I'll manage</unclear> really but</u>
<u n="44" who="S0530">no but when when <trunc>y</trunc></u>
<u n="45" who="S0529"><vocal desc="sigh"/> <event desc="sound of raspberry"/></u>
<u n="46" who="S0530">if you go back to your other work if you you probably work really hard at English like you <pause dur="short"/> it sounds like you fucking like <pause dur="short"/> went for that <pause dur="short"/> grade</u>
<u n="47" who="S0529">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I suppose</u>
<u n="48" who="S0530" trans="overlap">and maybe</u>
<u n="49" who="S0529">think I did</u>
<u n="50" who="S0530">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0529">but it's just <pause dur="short"/> you like do you think that I can actually get this back?</u>
<u n="52" who="S0530" trans="overlap">and <trunc>y</trunc>yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> of course I <trunc>ca</trunc> I wouldn't be saying this to you now</u>
<u n="53" who="S0529"><vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="54" who="S0530" trans="overlap">if if I thought that you you should go home I would've told you</u>
<u n="55" who="S0529">do you do you <pause dur="short"/> really?</u>
<u n="56" who="S0530">of course I would've done cos I've been in this situation</u>
<u n="57" who="S0529" trans="overlap">would you? <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="58" who="S0530">and I remember when people <pause dur="short"/> you know I know <pause dur="short"/> in some cases some people should <pause dur="short"/> go home university's</u>
<u n="59" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0530">not for them</u>
<u n="61" who="S0529">but I just I do feel like that I feel like it may be</u>
<u n="62" who="S0530" trans="overlap">the <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0529">not <pause dur="short"/> might <pause dur="short"/> not be for me like</u>
<u n="64" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0529">oh <vocal desc="sigh"/> it's just confusing really<pause dur="short"/> dunno <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> I mean cos even when I was like kind of in a better frame of mind I still wanna go to university it's never been like</u>
<u n="66" who="S0530">the goal</u>
<u n="67" who="S0529">what I wanted to do</u>
<u n="68" who="S0530">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0529">well no it kind of was the goal because that's just what you expect <pause dur="short"/> that's what people expect of you</u>
<u n="70" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0529">that's it's <pause dur="short"/> the kind of expected <pause dur="short"/> path to take</u>
<u n="72" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0529">after school and college</u>
<u n="74" who="S0530">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0529">but I never ever <pause dur="short"/> like since I was younger</u>
<u n="76" who="S0530" trans="overlap">particularly wanted</u>
<u n="77" who="S0529">all the years <pause dur="short"/> like leading up to it I've never wanted to go to university I've always thought thought I would be <pause dur="short"/> completely out of my depth <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> and <pause dur="short"/> here we are <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> so yeah it's just</u>
<u n="78" who="S0530">I mean yeah for me as well <pause dur="short"/> I'm the same really like personally <pause dur="short"/> I never wanted to go there I <trunc>ha</trunc></u>
<u n="79" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0530">yeah people students that had done <pause dur="short"/> you know they were <pause dur="short"/> enjoyed school were expected to go onto</u>
<u n="81" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0530">university</u>
<u n="83" who="S0529">but I did enjoy school but it's completely different</u>
<u n="84" who="S0530" trans="overlap"><unclear>they say</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0529">it's not</u>
<u n="86" who="S0530">it's not school here</u>
<u n="87" who="S0529">it's not the same in the slightest and <pause dur="short"/> I preferred kind of <pause dur="short"/> not being spoon fed but just knowing a little bit what <pause dur="short"/> was expected of me</u>
<u n="88" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="89" who="S0529">because we had teachers <pause dur="short"/> who would tell us what <pause dur="short"/> we were expected to do</u>
<u n="90" who="S0530" trans="overlap">to do</u>
<u n="91" who="S0529">and I liked that because there was some sort of <pause dur="short"/> you know certainty to it</u>
<u n="92" who="S0530">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="sigh"/> but just here it's just</u>
<u n="94" who="S0530">you're just not sure what you have to do</u>
<u n="95" who="S0529" trans="overlap">you know it's <pause dur="short"/> no no not at all <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> I don't know <pause dur="long"/> I just worry about the kind of person I'll become if I go home <pause dur="short"/> I mean cos I've changed so much <pause dur="short"/> like just this past year by just</u>
<u n="96" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0529" trans="overlap">sitting around so much <pause dur="short"/> like people say it to me all the time like I'm a really different <pause dur="short"/> kind of person</u>
<u n="98" who="S0530">in what in what way do they say you're different?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0529" trans="overlap">like you know I've never <pause dur="short"/> er they just say like <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>y</trunc> I just <pause dur="short"/> I just speak differently and <pause dur="short"/> I just act differently and <pause dur="short"/> react to things differently and <pause dur="short"/> I'm just not <trunc>an</trunc> as interested or <pause dur="short"/> kind of <pause dur="short"/> I dunno enthusiastic <pause dur="short"/> or</u>
<u n="100" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="101" who="S0529">I dunno yeah <pause dur="short"/> which I kind of get but also <pause dur="short"/> I feel like I've always been <trunc>r</trunc> negative like that but I suppose <pause dur="short"/> no I I mean I definitely have got worse like it's so obvious like <trunc>i</trunc> like I was reading <pause dur="short"/> through like my archive from like last year and the year before <pause dur="short"/> and it's just like the contrast is quite frightening like <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="103" who="S0529">like how much someone can sort of change <pause dur="short"/> the way they think about stuff <pause dur="short"/> it's just like some of the stuff I wrote when I was on <pause dur="short"/> you know Tumblr a few years ago it's just like that's not me that's not <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and I just worry that if I go home it's just gonna be like that again and <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="104" who="S0530">I think <pause dur="short"/> like obviously I think for a lot of <trunc>peo</trunc> part of growing up is <pause dur="short"/> that you get more <pause dur="short"/> cynical</u>
<u n="105" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0530">but at the same time <pause dur="short"/> the way you're feeling right now isn't just down to getting older at all</u>
<u n="107" who="S0529">no</u>
<u n="108" who="S0530">like <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="long"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> I mean <pause dur="short"/> you know when <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> when you were doing your A levels did you feel? <trunc>d</trunc> how how what did you feel when you were doing your A levels? I know that was a long time ago</u>
<u n="109" who="S0529"><vocal desc="laugh"/> does feel like a long time ago <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="110" who="S0530" trans="overlap">but like</u>
<u n="111" who="S0529">I mean I was depressed</u>
<u n="112" who="S0530">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0529">I wasn't</u>
<u n="114" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0529">any well I was different to how I am now but <trunc>i</trunc> I <pause dur="short"/> yeah I was depressed but I had I just <pause dur="short"/> like college was the distraction like I just did</u>
<u n="116" who="S0530" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="117" who="S0529">I just did the work for the exams but I didn't do enough <pause dur="short"/> because I couldn't concentrate for very long and er with all the mess but <pause dur="short"/> no I was a lot better than I am now <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="118" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="119" who="S0529">even though I was still kind of <pause dur="short"/> having the same problems really <pause dur="short"/> I was a lot less anxious <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing that has changed so much I think</u>
<u n="120" who="S0530">you just yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0529">I've become like really anxious <pause dur="short"/> just with everything <pause dur="short"/> like with literally pretty much everything in my life it's become <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> mm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0530">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that thing</u>
<u n="123" who="S0529" trans="overlap">this sort of <trunc>anxi</trunc></u>
<u n="124" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0529">anxiety and it's just like an irrational thing that's happened because of <pause dur="short"/> you know the way I've spent last year I suppose <pause dur="short"/> and just like the things that happened last year and <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0530">I think <pause dur="short"/> the more you're isolated <pause dur="short"/> the more <pause dur="short"/> prevalent can become</u>
<u n="127" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> no definitely</u>
<u n="128" who="S0530">because you kind of <pause dur="short"/> I don't know you just <pause dur="short"/> and I think <pause dur="short"/> that's why I was doubtful I think this is why in hindsight my parents were doubtful about me taking a gap year when I told them <pause dur="short"/> I didn't in the end I went to uni but</u>
<u n="129" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0530"><vocal desc="sigh"/> I think this is the sort of reason <pause dur="short"/> like after six months like <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what happened it's just <pause dur="short"/> I got even worse than when I had been at university and it it's really scary isn't it? like I can't imagine</u>
<u n="131" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know it's <unclear>hard</unclear> to imagine like being like being worse than you were when <pause dur="short"/> cos I thought I'd like hit the lowest point when I was uni last year</u>
<u n="132" who="S0530">right</u>
<u n="133" who="S0529" trans="overlap">but like I had like no idea how bad it would be when I got home like I just it was</u>
<u n="134" who="S0530" trans="overlap">same same I thought things would improve when I got home and they didn't</u>
<u n="135" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah I know <pause dur="short"/> just horrible really <pause dur="short"/> no I mean if I go home it's just <vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="136" who="S0530">it's returning to that</u>
<u n="137" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><unclear/> and like it really doesn't</u>
<u n="138" who="S0530" trans="overlap">but yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0529">and my family would <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="140" who="S0530" trans="overlap">eat you alive?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0529">they would just be yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> I could deal with that cos I'm I I I deserve it like I could deal with it if they were angry at me I just can't deal with the disappointment and the upset and the <pause dur="short"/> worry and <pause dur="short"/> all of that side of it <pause dur="short"/> cos that that really <pause dur="short"/> that really bothers me like I don't <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="142" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0529">I don't want them to be like that and it's just <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and it would be so difficult to get a job <pause dur="short"/> as well <pause dur="short"/> like there's just no chance for <pause dur="short"/> work in <pause dur="short"/> in <anon type="place"/> it's just impossible to get a job especially at this time of year <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and then I'd feel too anxious to do that anyway</u>
<u n="144" who="S0530">I read something <pause dur="short"/> about it was quite interesting actually it was like if I find it again I'll <pause dur="short"/> tell you</u>
<u n="145" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="146" who="S0530">it was like an article that some like an <trunc>e</trunc> a graduate wrote when they <pause dur="short"/> left uni <pause dur="short"/> and one of the things that they wish they'd done when they started university like <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>m</trunc> all the stuff they'd wished that they'd've done differently and I was like okay <pause dur="short"/> and in my first year <pause dur="short"/> I'm gonna read this because it's you know?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0530">why not? <pause dur="short"/> and she said <pause dur="short"/> what was it? I can't remember if it was a he or a she <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> they were talking about the <pause dur="short"/> kind of <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> the stress that you go through thinking about <pause dur="short"/> the years ahead <pause dur="short"/> that actually is quite paralysing</u>
