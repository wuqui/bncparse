<u n="1069" who="S0261">well she can teach she can <trunc>sp</trunc> she can speak fairly good English but really all I do is correct her when she's using <pause dur="short"/> using the wrong tense or something like that</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0262">oh okay</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0388">so how does it go then? she er she'll Skype you</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0388">and then what? she'll talk to you in English?</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0261">yeah we usually start in English and just kind of say hi and all that kind of stuff <pause dur="short"/> and we've been experimenting with some feedback from <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> about some teaching methods</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0388">oh right</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0261">and erm there are different ways to go all about it but erm she started off by just taking some online resources <pause dur="short"/> where say you can basically follow some flashcards <pause dur="short"/> so we would be observing the same thing <pause dur="short"/> like she can share her screen with me <pause dur="short"/> and so I see what's being played and I can simply go through and and read and pronounce the different words <pause dur="short"/> and erm she <pause dur="short"/> initially was correcting me as I go but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> put together a kind of a framework for a three day three day kind of thing where you start off just getting familiar with</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0388">yeah</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0261" trans="overlap">the <unclear>trying</unclear></u>
<u n="1079" who="S0388">yeah</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0261">and then erm <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> you do <unclear>trying</unclear> and then pronunciation and then you try to to string kind of small sentences together and that kind of thing</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0388">right <pause dur="short"/> very good</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0261">so erm</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0262" trans="overlap">so it's working out for you?</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0261">yeah in part erm she still goes too complex into like verbs and conjugations and all of that <pause dur="short"/> so rather than just letting me <pause dur="short"/> giving it a go even though I might be wrong</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0401">she still breaks in?</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0261">she she tries to break in and try to correct me and then we get lost down this rabbit hole of her explaining to me why it's this verb and that verb <pause dur="short"/> and I'm like well actually I don't care at the moment because I think if I said this to you on the street you'd probably pick up kind of the meaning about</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0401">mm</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0261">me being a tourist just kind of how</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0262" trans="overlap">see the</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0261">what are my intentions?</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0262" trans="overlap">the thing about it is is that you you know you've got to er decide for the sympathetic native speaker <pause dur="short"/> would they be able to provide you with the <pause dur="short"/> meaning behind what you are trying to actually convey?</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0401">mm</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0401">yeah</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0262" trans="overlap">cos quite a lot of the time being stuck is actually how you learn and <trunc>p</trunc> pick up you know internalise a language</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0401">mm</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0262">if someone's trying to tell you how to make it perfect from the start <pause dur="short"/> you're probably not gonna internalise it quite as much as you would if you were grappling</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0388">yeah</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0401">yeah</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0262">but once you've grappled and then secured it it's yours forever</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0388">yes</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0262">whereas if you're trying to say something to someone at such a level an intellectual level of a language</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0401">mm</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0262">it's nice for about two seconds but after that it actually</u>

<u n="1107" who="S0401" trans="overlap">doesn't it?</u>
<u n="1108" who="S0262">it doesn't stay with you it doesn't actually become part of you</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0388">mm</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0401" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0262">I think that's the only thing about learning a language is that <pause dur="short"/> the more mistakes you make</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0401">yeah</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0262">the better language <trunc>spea</trunc> this person will be able to pick up</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0401">yeah</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0262">in a way as long as you are able to correct the mistakes <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1116" who="S0401">yeah</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0262">and that's the beauty of it is that if somebody is there to help you <pause dur="short"/> so in a way</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0401" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0262">she could just listen to you <pause dur="short"/> and anything that comes out of your mouth she could either say thumbs up or</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0388">thumbs</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0262" trans="overlap">not so good</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0401">yeah <trunc>tota</trunc></u>
<u n="1123" who="S0262" trans="overlap">or totally not the right word <pause dur="short"/> she doesn't actually have to speak <pause dur="short"/> she could just do sign language</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0401">mm</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0262">and then you can stop and go</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0401" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0262">oh have I said something wrong? and then you go through your mind and go oh yeah</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0401" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0262">I just used the wrong word when I wanted to use that one</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0401">yeah</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0262">so you learn to self correct</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0262">that's that's another thing you do</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0401">yeah</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0262">and that takes skill to get the teacher to know how to</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0401">yeah</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0261">well and that's what works</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it's the learning space</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0261">that's works with me when I was <pause dur="short"/> working with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who's the other student who's up in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> and she's trying she's a teacher at school and she's trying to learn English so she can teach English in a Spanish school <pause dur="short"/> and erm so she got some</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0262" trans="overlap">was that her the other day? yeah</u>
<u n="1142" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah she's got some teaching skills <pause dur="short"/> and erm so we just tried a very different approach which was simply <pause dur="short"/> we'd get on and I would try to explain <pause dur="short"/> what happened yesterday but I would try it in Spanish</u>
<u n="1143" who="S0401">mm</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0261">so then it forced me to start trying to think through rather than just kind of rote repetition and not really trying to associate</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0401" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0261">stuff I would start having a think through okay I wanna say that I went for a walk down here and I went for ten kilometres <pause dur="short"/> and then I went to go and see this thing <pause dur="short"/> and then I asked a question about I needed to go the beach so I needed to find directions and all of this you know</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0388">yeah</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0401" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0261">kind of practical stuff and I found that for me that was a lot better <pause dur="short"/> way of <pause dur="short"/> feeling like you're gaining confidence but also I think you do you're making more progress</u>
<u n="1150" who="S0401">yeah</u>
<u n="1151" who="S0262">I think so</u>
<u n="1152" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="1153" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it's it's got to be quite a personal journey <pause dur="short"/> it's why everybody sitting there learning a language together at the same grade</u>
<u n="1154" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and people</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0262">doesn't work and that's why they shouldn't even bother doing it like that at school</u>
