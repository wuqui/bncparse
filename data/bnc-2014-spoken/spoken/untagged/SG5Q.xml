<u n="129" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="130" who="S0278" trans="overlap">no more twenty-four notes but there's more than that because you're looking at four in front of you cos you've got your sharps and flats as well as your two two main notes and then you've got a sharp and your flats so you've got looking at four and they've given me the music which is helps because I can look through it but it's not the music I'll be looking at because we share music just you can't get enough in so we share</u>

<u n="134" who="S0278">warns me before you see and and put the flat down you want back to the natural that's it <vocal desc="laugh"/> she's good now you want your mallet oh picking a mallet up bong you know because you can mallet them and you can</u>
<u n="135" who="S0012" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="136" who="S0278">ring them and go dong dong <unclear/> there's all sorts of oh</u>
<u n="137" who="S0013" trans="overlap">oh</u>

<u n="144" who="S0013" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="145" who="S0278">there's this one piece it keeps going from it starts off four in a bar then you get the odd <trunc>si</trunc>six beat bar <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know <shift new="singing"/> da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da <shift new="normal"/> and I'm getting going and then you end up with a six-beat bar and I'm still counting four and then I get I'm lost by the time you see?</u>
