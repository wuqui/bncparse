<u n="1" who="S0486">on yes <pause dur="short"/> right so we're recording now I'll put that in the middle of the table there <pause dur="short"/> and we were going <trunc>t</trunc> erm we were going to talk about the door weren't we?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0489">yes so we've got the existing opening and the requirement is to have a nice door that fits in with the same style as the door that we've taken out but with two large glass panels instead of one large plywood panel</u>
<u n="3" who="S0486">yeah and you agree that that leaving the er most of the glass plain will allow more light to pass from the erm from the study into the hallway?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0489">yes that's got to be the main aim what we can do is try and get erm if I look up the standard dimensions of door styles we can work out what the window opening will be and then you can make your glass panel to suit that's probably</u>
<u n="5" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="6" who="S0489" trans="overlap">the easiest way</u>
<u n="7" who="S0486">yes well I think you you mentioned earlier something about the glass being erm the right thickness to go inside the</u>
<u n="8" who="S0489">yes we've got</u>
<u n="9" who="S0486" trans="overlap">the frame</u>
<u n="10" who="S0489" trans="overlap">to make sure that the er that the glass is is the right thickness but probably more importantly than that is the fact that it's nice and flat because if the glass is a little bit thicker than the original plywood panel would have been we can er adjust that with the beading that we've put in on the inside but if it's not flat that's much more difficult to accommodate er you know you can't really build it up with putty or or anything like that so it's it's it's got to be fairly flat</u>
<u n="11" who="S0486">I think you're gonna have to give me a measurement of the erm thickness of the glass that you want I know it'll be er probably varied in places</u>
<u n="12" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="13" who="S0486">but we need to know what what the thickness of the glass is going to be</u>
<u n="14" who="S0489">yes well <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc>you know you're you're gonna start off presumably with a flat sheet of glass erm and it'll get a bit distorted in the firing is that is that the likely route?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0486">well here's er here's a piece of here's a piece of glass that we</u>
<u n="16" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="17" who="S0486">made before and I believe <vocal desc="cough"/> on this one erm I'm pretty sure what happened we had two pieces of float glass one on</u>
<u n="18" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="19" who="S0486" trans="overlap">the top and one on the bottom and in the middle we put various colours</u>
<u n="20" who="S0489">oh yes that's right yes we did</u>
<u n="21" who="S0486" trans="overlap">can you see it?</u>
<u n="22" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes we did yeah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0486">erm I</u>
<u n="24" who="S0489">so it was a complete sandwich in fact</u>
<u n="25" who="S0486" trans="overlap">well can you just feel that and tell me whether</u>
<u n="26" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0486" trans="overlap">you think that that is that sandwiched in between do you think?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0489">er</u>
<u n="29" who="S0486">we certainly <trunc>wa</trunc></u>
<u n="30" who="S0489" trans="overlap">maybe it was just maybe these pieces were just put on top</u>
<u n="31" who="S0486" trans="overlap">on top</u>
<u n="32" who="S0489">but either way they've they've melted down to a pretty uniform thickness</u>
<u n="33" who="S0486">yeah and those are stringers</u>
<u n="34" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="35" who="S0486">you know where there's just a very thin bit?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0489" trans="overlap">but the the bit that side which was against the mould is actually dead flat <pause dur="short"/> that's no problem at all that that edge there is dead flat</u>
<u n="37" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah but here you've got a bit of variegation</u>
<u n="38" who="S0489">that's not a problem though but</u>
<u n="39" who="S0486" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="40" who="S0489">the the the the <trunc>f</trunc> the the edges aren't a problem but the flatness is there so if the if the piece of glass were mounted on something flat in the kiln all the way round it wouldn't be an issue at all</u>
<u n="41" who="S0486">no well that's what I'm planning to do</u>
<u n="42" who="S0489">yes yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0486">erm and erm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0489">and if this if the glass is a little bit smaller than the wooden frame then that's great <trunc>e</trunc>erm if it isn't small if it it actually won't quite go in the hole then we can always machine out the wood a little bit</u>
<u n="45" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0489">around to make up that difference</u>
<u n="47" who="S0486">well we've got to take into account the fact that we'll need some extra glass to go round the sides erm to erm sort of fit into the holes provided erm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0489">yes the the well it</u>
<u n="49" who="S0486" trans="overlap">to <trunc>hol</trunc> yes</u>
<u n="50" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yeah it won't be part of the design is it?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0486" trans="overlap">exactly</u>
<u n="52" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yeah yes</u>
<u n="53" who="S0486" trans="overlap">so we just <trunc>l</trunc>leave a ridge of plain glass all the way</u>
<u n="54" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="55" who="S0486">round the outside</u>
<u n="56" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="57" who="S0486">because actually <vocal desc="cough"/> the actual pattern of the glass will be virtually and placed in the middle of the two panels</u>
<u n="58" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="59" who="S0486"><vocal desc="sigh"/> erm that's where the most of the thickness will be</u>
<u n="60" who="S0489">yeah yes the the the horizontal piece that goes across the sort of whatever it is two thirds of the way up or or one third of the way up whatever we choose that's obviously going to break the design but you're going to have it as if that's just a sort of shadow across and the design flows through from one side to the other</u>
<u n="61" who="S0486">er yes</u>
<u n="62" who="S0489">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0486">it it erm I'm starting at the bottom with a lavender</u>
<u n="64" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="65" who="S0486">erm a sort of <vocal desc="cough"/> going er over to the right er a bit like looking at a paint brush really</u>
<u n="66" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="67" who="S0486" trans="overlap">so it's flowing like a paint brush erm and then the I there's a slim chunk of the erm Canadian maple tree will come up the middle of the glass and then there'll be the rebate going across</u>
<u n="68" who="S0489">yes yes</u>
<u n="69" who="S0486" trans="overlap">and then it will continue in the next section</u>
<u n="70" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="71" who="S0486">going up</u>
<u n="72" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="73" who="S0486">and there will be</u>
<u n="74" who="S0489">so what I'm saying is the rebate sort of just hides that bit of the picture</u>
<u n="75" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0489" trans="overlap">as it were the picture is continuous</u>
<u n="77" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="78" who="S0489" trans="overlap">beyond that rebate yes</u>
<u n="79" who="S0486" trans="overlap">because when I do the when I do the when I do the cartoon for the project I will make sure that erm I do two separate sections of glass which and I I I'll draw the whole thing and then just cut it in half</u>
<u n="80" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="81" who="S0486">and so mm mm these two panels could be fired at different times or</u>
<u n="82" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="83" who="S0486" trans="overlap">at the same time depending on how depending on how much <vocal desc="cough"/> er much scope there is in the kiln really</u>
<u n="84" who="S0489">the other thing of course is that if we get the <trunc>n</trunc> a new door made I haven't got to mess around trying to fill in the door handles and the</u>
<u n="85" who="S0486" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="86" who="S0489">holes in the old</u>
<u n="87" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0489">the keyhole in the old door or the hinges I would still have to fill in the hinges and the lock plate on the door frame that's in place but that's that's less work and the other thing we've got to remember er of course the switch will be on the wrong side of the door so I'll have to move the switch to the other side but I think I can do that by putting a piece of wire across the top of the door as it were and down the other side</u>
<u n="89" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="90" who="S0489">and sort of using the existing switch as a junction box</u>
<u n="91" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="92" who="S0489">er it's not ideal but I think that's much preferable to having to take up the erm carpet on the landing and and knock a hole through the ceiling which is much more work</u>
<u n="93" who="S0486">yes yes I understand that</u>
<u n="94" who="S0489" trans="overlap">so I think that's I think that's a fairly neat way of doing</u>
<u n="95" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0489" trans="overlap">because you obviously need the switch on the correct side of the door otherwise you can never get to it</u>
<u n="97" who="S0486">no</u>
<u n="98" who="S0489" trans="overlap">with the door open</u>
<u n="99" who="S0486">no I see okay and then of course there's the matter of the other erm extra panel for the wall in the hallway</u>
<u n="100" who="S0489">oh yes</u>
<u n="101" who="S0486">erm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="103" who="S0486">I thought erm fifty</u>
<u n="104" who="S0489" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="105" who="S0486">by a hundred er in size</u>
<u n="106" who="S0489">hundred's quite tall isn't it?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0486">yeah but if you look at that I think</u>
<u n="108" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="109" who="S0486" trans="overlap">that's nearly</u>
<u n="110" who="S0489" trans="overlap">could be</u>
<u n="111" who="S0486" trans="overlap">a hundred tall</u>
<u n="112" who="S0489">erm I think it's a little bit less than that but but it could be taller certainly and there is space there</u>
<u n="113" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0489" trans="overlap">to do it yes</u>
<u n="115" who="S0486" trans="overlap">and then erm I was thinking along the lines of a red sail and a jetty</u>
<u n="116" who="S0489">very nice</u>
<u n="117" who="S0486">erm and er you know erm a bit like when we went on Derwent water</u>
<u n="118" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="119" who="S0486" trans="overlap">where we were watching the boats and the <vocal desc="cough"/> the grass was and and the trees were growing right down to the lakeside weren't they?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0489">yes absolutely and and the a bit of green bit of blue er bit of grey and then the bright red sail to sort of</u>
<u n="121" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0489">mm <trunc>r</trunc>really stand out</u>
<u n="123" who="S0486">and I was thinking of having the jetty going from the foreground to a vanishing point</u>
<u n="124" who="S0489">oh yes that's very er</u>
<u n="125" who="S0486">erm</u>
<u n="126" who="S0489" trans="overlap">er</u>
<u n="127" who="S0486">going off to the side</u>
<u n="128" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="129" who="S0486">and then have the sail sort of halfway down and then the background of the green tree</u>
<u n="130" who="S0489">sounds good that's a very</u>
<u n="131" who="S0486" trans="overlap">I thought I'd make the jetty almost almost like a sort of lemony <vocal desc="cough"/> creamy colour a bit like Hockney swimming pool type erm idea</u>
<u n="132" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes that sounds good that sounds good there's plenty of composition scope there with a vanishing point and whatnot for the jetty yes that sounds good</u>
<u n="133" who="S0486" trans="overlap">really quite stylised you know</u>
<u n="134" who="S0489">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0486">erm</u>
<u n="136" who="S0489" trans="overlap">that sounds good</u>
<u n="137" who="S0486">so erm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0489" trans="overlap">that sounds very good</u>
<u n="139" who="S0486">how long have we been speaking for?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0489">er then we've got the issue of lighting it up where</u>
<u n="141" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="142" who="S0489" trans="overlap">as I say I've seen these light strips in Maplin's which are lengths of flexible almost tape that have got little LEDs embedded within them and you can use those for sort of putting behind glass or erm it <trunc>m</trunc>may even be mount them on the wall and stand the glass off from the wall I don't know there are lots of experiments we could do there to try and</u>
<u n="143" who="S0486" trans="overlap">you can</u>
<u n="144" who="S0489" trans="overlap">er see the most effective way</u>
<u n="145" who="S0486" trans="overlap">I mean you can get some a really lovely you can buy them from the glass manufacturers these really lovely quite outstanding erm chromium erm <trunc>fi</trunc>fixings</u>
<u n="146" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes yes we've seen some of them haven't we?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh they're absolutely fantastic</u>
<u n="148" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="149" who="S0486" trans="overlap">and I'm sure they're expensive</u>
<u n="150" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="151" who="S0486">and you get those from</u>
<u n="152" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="153" who="S0486">and then if it stands out well I'm sure there's a plate a light that's like a plate that you slip behind</u>
<u n="154" who="S0489">there are you can get them for actually room lighting a sort of an LED panel</u>
<u n="155" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0489">I suspect they're probably going to be a bit bright for that but I don't know we could look at it erm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0486" trans="overlap">well we may not need to I mean</u>
<u n="158" who="S0489" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="159" who="S0486" trans="overlap">we may not <trunc>nee</trunc>need it</u>
<u n="160" who="S0489">well I think you</u>
<u n="161" who="S0486" trans="overlap">I mean the other thing you could do possibly is to have a light above it erm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="163" who="S0486" trans="overlap">or a light or a light under it</u>
<u n="164" who="S0489">it maybe <trunc>w</trunc> you can sort of put a a piece of translucent just plain translucent glass behind the the artwork and light that up as it were</u>
<u n="165" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0489">something like that I dunno it needs a bit of experimentation doesn't it? it's er</u>
<u n="167" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah I mean if it's a very bright panel</u>
<u n="168" who="S0489">mm er maybe it doesn't need any more</u>
<u n="169" who="S0486">erm what we've got there at the moment is erm rather dark and er</u>
<u n="170" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes we could er we could aim one of the spotlights directly at it or directly at the ceiling above it or something or other and maybe maybe that would be enough</u>
<u n="171" who="S0486">yeah yeah so erm <pause dur="short"/> what erm what <trunc>el</trunc> what else are we going to get on <trunc>wi</trunc>? oh yes the fencing panels tomorrow</u>
<u n="172" who="S0489">yes well we're doing quite well aren't we? we've done erm <trunc>e</trunc> we're just coming up to eleven and there's six to go so er we can we can bash on with that that's about erm er well it's three er three or four days' work</u>
<u n="173" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="174" who="S0489" trans="overlap">at our present rate so we should have that done before the weather changes</u>
<u n="175" who="S0486">and you'll be back by about quarter to two</u>
<u n="176" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="177" who="S0486">erm erm erm and I should go out er after lunch and erm paint a whole lot of er more more</u>
<u n="178" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="179" who="S0486">more panels</u>
<u n="180" who="S0489">and I can</u>
<u n="181" who="S0486" trans="overlap">to put up</u>
<u n="182" who="S0489" trans="overlap">do the vacuuming and and we'll be able after an hour or so or an hour and a half we'll be</u>
<u n="183" who="S0486" trans="overlap">we'll we'll have a enough to put up</u>
<u n="184" who="S0489" trans="overlap">we'll be able to meet up and carry on with it</u>
<u n="185" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah okay well there is erm there are other things that we should talk about to do with with the house at the moment the other thing that we could possibly discuss is the erm raised beds down in by <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="186" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="187" who="S0486">in in the second garden</u>
<u n="188" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="189" who="S0486">erm they are <pause dur="short"/> so you've got you've got some timber left over haven't you? you've got some timber left over haven't you?</u>
<u n="190" who="S0489">a rooftop a rooftop vegetable garden as it were except it won't be very high <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="191" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="192" who="S0489">yes we've got enough enough timber to erm do something like that quite easily I think</u>
<u n="193" who="S0486">I have reservations about cutting down a lot of the rosemary tree because I think</u>
<u n="194" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="195" who="S0486">it's really nice and</u>
<u n="196" who="S0489" trans="overlap">well that's okay we don't have to do what we've got to look out for is a is a steel or a erm a metal er tank type thing to form the top</u>
<u n="197" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="198" who="S0489">that's what we really need we need a thing about the size of this table but eight or nine inches deep</u>
<u n="199" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="200" who="S0489">something that that's waterproof really</u>
<u n="201" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="202" who="S0489">er I mean I suppose it could be plastic but we could encase it in timber all the way round but it needs to be waterproof</u>
<u n="203" who="S0486">it does yes</u>
<u n="204" who="S0489">erm and sort of</u>
<u n="205" who="S0486" trans="overlap">those erm those mm unfortunately those rather thick chunky offcuts that you had aren't tall enough are they?</u>
<u n="206" who="S0489">erm</u>
<u n="207" who="S0486">the ones you've got in the erm in <trunc>th</trunc> in the workshop <trunc>wh</trunc> you had them <unclear>soaking</unclear></u>
<u n="208" who="S0489" trans="overlap">no they're probably not no</u>
<u n="209" who="S0486" trans="overlap">but they're really I mean they'd make a really good garden bench</u>
<u n="210" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="211" who="S0486" trans="overlap">if we could just find</u>
<u n="212" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="213" who="S0486">a nice piece of wood to go on the top</u>
<u n="214" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="215" who="S0486">like that chap uses down in</u>
<u n="216" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yeah we could</u>
<u n="217" who="S0486"><anon type="place"/> we could put</u>
<u n="218" who="S0489" trans="overlap">we could we could find something like that we could find</u>
<u n="219" who="S0486" trans="overlap">just a plain</u>
<u n="220" who="S0489">but we've got to concentrate on finding the tank or the the the waterproof I suppose it doesn't have to be one big <pause dur="short"/> you know tank it could be three smaller ones perhaps and that starts to lead you with the idea of plastic boxes but erm the and you'd probably have to cut them down a bit but something like that that we could make erm two or three separate <pause dur="short"/> you know patches together maybe <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="221" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I don't think we're thinking along the same lines there but <trunc>y</trunc> never mind we'll</u>
<u n="222" who="S0489" trans="overlap">well we've got to think of something like that</u>
<u n="223" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/> er <vocal desc="laugh"/> I</u>
<u n="224" who="S0489" trans="overlap">I er or we could just make it out of wood and line it with plastic sheet but it's never so good is it? it needs it ought to be a rigid</u>
<u n="225" who="S0486" trans="overlap">no I</u>
<u n="226" who="S0489" trans="overlap">rigid</u>
<u n="227" who="S0486" trans="overlap">I'm I well I know what you mean by a tank you mean like a</u>
<u n="228" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="229" who="S0486" trans="overlap">it's <trunc>alm</trunc> like a swimming pool on</u>
<u n="230" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="231" who="S0486">legs</u>
<u n="232" who="S0489">yes that's right</u>
<u n="233" who="S0486">and that would be full of full of earth</u>
<u n="234" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="235" who="S0486">and and therefore it won't make the timber <trunc>r</trunc>rot</u>
<u n="236" who="S0489" trans="overlap">absolutely</u>
<u n="237" who="S0486">because er it'll be erm be barriered by the plastic</u>
<u n="238" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="239" who="S0486">I can understand that</u>
<u n="240" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="241" who="S0486">so that's quite interesting right so <pause dur="short"/> I think we'll just go on for a few more minutes talking about this</u>
<u n="242" who="S0489">uhu</u>
<u n="243" who="S0486" trans="overlap">erm is there anything else you want to say? oh what about taking the old fencing panels up? that's a</u>
<u n="244" who="S0489">yeah well I think that's that's okay we can we can start that er and the important thing is to work steadily along and er dig out the soil get out the roots and put the protective barrier in and put the soil back in free of roots I think probably we need to buy a riddle or something to get rid of the the the plant matter as you put the soil back in but anyway the the that's the objective and do it gradually all the way along</u>
<u n="245" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah well we need to go up to the garden centre and find out what sort of soil these plants</u>
<u n="246" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="247" who="S0486">this really dislike</u>
<u n="248" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes that's right yes</u>
<u n="249" who="S0486" trans="overlap">because they're going berserk and they're just growing everywhere</u>
<u n="250" who="S0489">of course some of the length we're going to do with gravel aren't we? so</u>
<u n="251" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="252" who="S0489" trans="overlap">erm</u>
<u n="253" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="254" who="S0489" trans="overlap">we can put down the piece of plastic a piece of polythene sheet and then put those yellow chippings on top and that's easy there's no</u>
<u n="255" who="S0486" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="256" who="S0489">no issue there</u>
<u n="257" who="S0486">if it's <trunc>h</trunc><trunc>h</trunc>how yeah but how how why do you see that gap being you know from the from the new fence into the garden how wide did you see?</u>
<u n="258" who="S0489" trans="overlap">oh just</u>
<u n="259" who="S0486">two two foot?</u>
<u n="260" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yeah mm maybe not quite that much but</u>
<u n="261" who="S0486">but</u>
<u n="262" who="S0489" trans="overlap">something like that yes</u>
<u n="263" who="S0486" trans="overlap">you know what they're like they can come up under that</u>
<u n="264" who="S0489" trans="overlap">ah but</u>
<u n="265" who="S0486" trans="overlap">cos they've already</u>
<u n="266" who="S0489" trans="overlap">if we put the plastic erm er roof edging pieces down into the ground so</u>
<u n="267" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="268" who="S0489" trans="overlap">three or four inches into the ground</u>
<u n="269" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="270" who="S0489">they shouldn't come under there</u>
<u n="271" who="S0486">no</u>
<u n="272" who="S0489">but even if they did they then have to negotiate er eighteen inches of barren soil under a plastic sheet under the gravel I don't think they'll get past that</u>
<u n="273" who="S0486">no well</u>
<u n="274" who="S0489" trans="overlap">I should have thought that was fairly erm</u>
<u n="275" who="S0486">I <trunc>ho</trunc></u>
<u n="276" who="S0489" trans="overlap">fairly secure</u>
<u n="277" who="S0486">I hope so erm</u>
<u n="278" who="S0489" trans="overlap">well <trunc>i</trunc>if they do they're more likely to be transmitted by seeds I would think under those conditions</u>
<u n="279" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="280" who="S0489" trans="overlap">airborne seeds than than penetrating roots</u>
<u n="281" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="282" who="S0489">it's interesting that metal barrier there that I dug up</u>
<u n="283" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="284" who="S0489">they didn't <trunc>see</trunc>seem to be any sign of the roots going across the other side there weren't plants spreading across from the other side obviously there <trunc>w</trunc> are some the</u>
<u n="285" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="286" who="S0489" trans="overlap">other side but I don't' think they've done</u>
<u n="287" who="S0486">well maybe</u>
<u n="288" who="S0489" trans="overlap">that they've</u>
<u n="289" who="S0486" trans="overlap">it's a special metal they don't like</u>
<u n="290" who="S0489">mm well that's possible I think it's</u>
<u n="291" who="S0486" trans="overlap">because</u>
<u n="292" who="S0489">I think it's simply a barrier and it</u>
<u n="293" who="S0486" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="294" who="S0489" trans="overlap">stops the roots going through</u>
<u n="295" who="S0486">no people who who put the garden in originally were really keen gardeners and didn't she do a course at <anon type="place"/> college? and she was really up on propagation</u>
<u n="296" who="S0489">yes I think she was</u>
<u n="297" who="S0486" trans="overlap">and planting?</u>
<u n="298" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="299" who="S0486">and I'm sure <trunc>th</trunc>they would have thought about the voracity of the</u>
<u n="300" who="S0489">yes</u>
<u n="301" who="S0486">erm of of the plants</u>
<u n="302" who="S0489">well that's possible but I I I still think the fundamental thing is a physical barrier</u>
<u n="303" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="304" who="S0489" trans="overlap">and it providing it doesn't deteriorate I don't think it really matters what it is</u>
