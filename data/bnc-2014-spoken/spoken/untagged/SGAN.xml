<u n="512" who="S0315">I know and I'm I'm not I just I'm not</u>
<u n="513" who="S0255">no</u>
<u n="514" who="S0315">up on it I should be but I'm not sometimes I <trunc>massa</trunc>massage far too low than what I should do because I like to be able to put my weight through my arms</u>
<u n="515" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="516" who="S0315">so I'm almost leaning into them for the for the pressure but that isn't really doing my back any good</u>
<u n="517" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah mm mm</u>
<u n="518" who="S0315">because I'm bending over too far with the pressure</u>
<u n="519" who="S0255">mm could you stand on something have a slight like a long step thing you can put next to the bed?</u>
<u n="520" who="S0315">could do cos I mean I come up and down</u>

<u n="526" who="S0315">yeah that might help try it she said get as close to the couch as possible and then what you do is you're bending from your hips then not leaning over</u>
<u n="527" who="S0255">yeah yeah that's the thing you've got to just be really conscious the next so many times you do it to get in a different position and once you do that you'll remember won't you then and?</u>
<u n="528" who="S0315">yeah yeah and then it becomes second nature</u>
<u n="529" who="S0255">yeah mm</u>

<u n="754" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="755" who="S0255">we I was walking the kids up to go and get this the bus they were getting to get to school erm and they were five and six at the time and we were walking past burnt out cars that weren't there the day before and they weren't even batting an eyelid and I was thinking I'm not having my kids thinking this is normal life again</u>
<u n="756" who="S0315">mm yeah</u>
<u n="757" who="S0255">cos I know it was</u>
<u n="758" who="S0315">did you work at at the time?</u>

<u n="766" who="S0315">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="767" who="S0255">cos <trunc>the</trunc>they started of at erm <anon type="place"/> is it?</u>
<u n="768" who="S0315">uhu</u>
<u n="769" who="S0255">and that again that was really rough erm and I was sort of dropping them off trying to get go back and sort out what I was doing and you know I was getting counselling at the time and erm yeah and it was horrible so I just thought again I don't know where I'm going to be but I'm not dropping the kids off with them coming out saying this you know the boys said they're going to do this and that and <trunc>get</trunc> and it was just no so I went to <anon type="place"/> made an appointment and went up to have a look round and they were basically saying well you know you you you don't really fit any of the criteria cos they were going through the criteria cos they were going through the questions like well are you Catholic? no do you go to church? no</u>
<u n="770" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="771" who="S0255">do you live within the catchment area? no</u>
<u n="772" who="S0315">no</u>
<u n="773" who="S0255">et cetera et cetera et cetera and he went on and on and on with all these different things as we were walking round but as we were walking round <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> bless them they were showing us round the things and we went into one room which was higher up in the school and it was erm a science project and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> went and started looking oh I know if you do that that'll make that and he liked that sort of thing cos he's really switched on with that way the the maths and science and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> walking round went into one of the top years and picked up oh mummy I read this last week yes and you know and all that so</u>
<u n="774" who="S0315">they were like</u>
<u n="775" who="S0255">yeah well they thought yeah okay they were nice polite bright kids and that but</u>
<u n="776" who="S0315">yeah that's what we want in the school</u>
<u n="777" who="S0255">yeah and he basically said I'm going to have to put this before the governors he said because you don't meet any of the criteria and I said look I said the reason I want them to come to this school I said we've gone through this this and this therefore we're in refuge I'm not sure where I'm gonna get housed but it will be somewhere in <anon type="place"/> vicinity I need to know that while I'm moving about cos we might move a few times I can put my kids on the bus that you your school bus every morning they're going to be delivered on a good school have a good education in a safe secure environment while I'm sorting the rest of their life out which really isn't very good at the minute</u>
<u n="778" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="779" who="S0255">and he said I'll see what I can do and and it was the headmaster and he went to the governors and we got accepted in</u>
<u n="780" who="S0315">they were really good</u>
<u n="781" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="782" who="S0315">he is they still go there even when you went to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="783" who="S0255">yeah they were still going there then</u>
<u n="784" who="S0315">yeah that's good isn't it? they stayed in the same school</u>
<u n="785" who="S0255">yeah yeah yeah they kept them there and then when we moved to <anon type="place"/> I said to them yep this is where we're gonna stay now yeah I think if you want to go to the local school you can have a think cos I started to give them as much so they had some choice cos obviously they'd been sort of one day just suddenly now yeah I think if you want to go to the local school you can have a think cos I started to give them as much so they had some choice cos obviously they'd been sort of one day just suddenly get in a car we're going to <anon type="place"/> to stay with your auntie</u>
<u n="786" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="787" who="S0255">oh now we're going into the refuge in <anon type="place"/> oh now we've been found by matey therefore we've got to go to another refuge in <anon type="place"/> now you're going to this school <trunc>no</trunc> so they they had so much that they couldn't control so I I said you know if you like we can go and look at the local school and if you like it you can go if not you can stay going to this to where you're going now</u>
<u n="788" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="789" who="S0255">right the way through and then obviously there was the secondary school after it so they both went we'll go and have a look we'll go and have a look and we went and looked round you know the school and they seemed to like it and they they both said we want to come here we want to be able to walk to school we want to do this we want to of that</u>
<u n="790" who="S0315">brilliant</u>
<u n="791" who="S0255">so I said okay and that was again they were sort of six and seven age but I just I thought yeah that's fine you know so I went in and thanked the school very much and they said they were really pleased with how they'd got on and they were settled</u>
<u n="792" who="S0315">great really come round</u>
<u n="793" who="S0255">mm and that was the other reason why when when they were leaving primary school they could've taken the exams to go to <anon type="place"/> school again I was told both of them you know they should pass the exams no problem they'd get in there</u>
<u n="794" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="795" who="S0255">and I said to them do you want to take the exams? do you want to go you know you can go to <anon type="place"/> we can go and look at it or you can go to <anon type="place"/> and they both when it got to their time said we want to stay with the friends we've made we don't want to start moving and making more friends again fine you know</u>
<u n="796" who="S0315">yeah just went with what they wanted to do</u>
<u n="797" who="S0255">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="798" who="S0315">did they go to <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="799" who="S0255">yeah they went to <anon type="place"/> yeah</u>
<u n="800" who="S0315">was that quite good at the time?</u>
<u n="801" who="S0255">yeah it was actually cos I think it had had a time of not being brilliant</u>
<u n="802" who="S0315">mm</u>
<u n="803" who="S0255">erm and then there was a new headmaster or somebody came in and made it better and</u>
<u n="804" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="805" who="S0255">yeah I think</u>
<u n="806" who="S0315">so they sort of had their last years there okay</u>
<u n="807" who="S0255">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="808" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="809" who="S0255">and I think to be honest school is what kids get out of it</u>
<u n="810" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="811" who="S0255">I mean when they were really little in <anon type="place"/> and that was all a bit cos it was chaotic at the time but once you get into secondary school if the kids are going to put in the work they can get out what their potential is</u>
<u n="812" who="S0315">absolutely</u>
<u n="813" who="S0255">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="814" who="S0315">it's a good sports college up there isn't it?</u>
<u n="815" who="S0255">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="816" who="S0315">up at erm <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="817" who="S0255">is that where your two will go?</u>
<u n="818" who="S0315">I don't know because they are on about building another school over <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="819" who="S0255">oh are they?</u>
<u n="820" who="S0315">which is going to be called <anon type="place"/> so literally behind us</u>
<u n="821" who="S0255">okay oh right yeah</u>
<u n="822" who="S0315">so <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> will be in catchment for that as well</u>
<u n="823" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="824" who="S0315">but you know what will happen there've been far too many houses on <anon type="place"/> on the new bit across the way and they won't be able to fit us in I think</u>
<u n="825" who="S0255" trans="overlap">no no yeah no but you'll be in the catchment for <anon type="place"/> as well here wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="826" who="S0315">yes</u>
<u n="827" who="S0255">that's another thing cos</u>
<u n="828" who="S0315">yeah but that I mean hopefully by that point my mine go to <trunc>je</trunc><trunc>in</trunc> senior school that would've turned itself round cos that's obviously special measures at the moment</u>
<u n="829" who="S0255" trans="overlap">isn't that a very good one no? oh is it oh I don't know</u>
<u n="830" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="831" who="S0255">I once your kids leave school you sort of you're out the loop a bit</u>
<u n="832" who="S0315">you're out you are out the loop yeah I mean the er head he erm I think he was on his way out really but he was just biding a bit of time and erm you know things are just have just got into a bit of a state</u>
<u n="833" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="834" who="S0315">so they're just going in and having to sort it out</u>
<u n="835" who="S0255">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="836" who="S0315">so but usually after you know they pay so much more attention to it it turns round quite quickly</u>
<u n="837" who="S0255">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="838" who="S0315">so it's not always a bad thing really</u>
<u n="839" who="S0255">no no</u>
<u n="840" who="S0315">it's like well in <anon type="place"/> that's in special measures as well so</u>
<u n="841" who="S0255">is it?</u>
<u n="842" who="S0255">yeah but again it's turning itself round so</u>
<u n="843" who="S0255">yeah yeah I think erm years ago school had the same teachers and same head teachers for years and years and years and they were a set school you had your grammars your comprehensives your all girls all boys</u>
<u n="844" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="845" who="S0255">you know secondary modern schools or whatever and they <trunc>di</trunc> they were very steady and they just carried on being the same the same the same</u>
<u n="846" who="S0315">mm</u>
<u n="847" who="S0255">and now everything's all mixed up and chopping and changing</u>
<u n="848" who="S0315">yeah</u>
<u n="849" who="S0255">teachers come and go head head teachers come and go</u>
<u n="850" who="S0315">people can't cope with it</u>
<u n="851" who="S0255">it no no ad there's so much bureaucracy and paper work and and Ofsted and what's needed</u>
<u n="852" who="S0315">ah it's crazy</u>
<u n="853" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="854" who="S0315">I don't know how any of these teachers do it</u>
<u n="855" who="S0255">no</u>

<u n="994" who="S0255">yeah that's it cos it's it's either snow or the the bit you stand on it's like a matting bit so you don't you stop sliding and you stand and yeah it comes round and then it just <trunc>beh</trunc> you just sit down so you just look and you sit down on it it lifts you up and then you just pull the bar down carry your poles</u>
<u n="995" who="S0315" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> right</u>

<u n="1072" who="S0315">ah off-piste</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0255">but but <trunc>ge</trunc> but yeah but but eh <trunc>s</trunc> he said we're not going down it he said we started he said follow me exactly and he went across like that and he said now you turn and we went across and we just kept doing that like a few times and then he said stop he said now look he said see what you've come down and he said you haven't come down you've gone across he said if you're ever worried he said just go across you can't get faster going across and then you sort of do a little but but then you turn and that slows you and then you come across and it was like oh yeah so we did that and yeah I got I was still more nervous then I was okay skiing and I'd do blues but I wouldn't do red and after a couple of holidays I still wouldn't do reds and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> kept going why not? no no no</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0315">was he getting into reds then</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0255">he'd want to do them but I wouldn't go with him a so he'd sometimes go with if we met up with people he'd go with them but I was like no no I'm quite happy doing my blues and then one night somebody said in the bar well they're not they're not reds I said what? he said they're not red they're dark blues he said just think of that he said you get a <trunc>b</trunc> a lot of red is easier than the hardest bits on the blues he said cos they cross over he said you've got a blue which is fairly easy and then it's got some harder bits it's easy harder easy harder the harder bits one the blue are harder than the easy bits on the red and I was like oh he said they're dark blues and the next day I went out and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> goes alright let's do a dark blue then and I'm like alright then</u>

<u n="1080" who="S0315" trans="overlap">and never looked back isn't it funny? so erm so you don't actually just go in a straight you do go in a straight line don't you?</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0255">you you go</u>

<u n="1084" who="S0315">ah</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0255">or you can go more straight down and then you do this to slow yourself down or</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0315">so do you think after that it's just practice?</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0255">yeah it is and it's getting the technique right as well because we we sort of carried on from then and just did a lot of skiing and got better but actually we should have had more lessons earlier on</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0315">right</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0255">because we got a lot of bad habits and bad ways whereas <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he's got a lot better ski technique than me erm and we had some lessons and he now is getting more and more advanced in how he's skiing whereas I've I've still got certain bits that I'm not quite doing right and I can't understand cos they say do this I <trunc>ne</trunc> I need to get once I've done it and it clicks into place I'll be alright but we can go down anywhere we do we do blacks reds everything erm</u>
