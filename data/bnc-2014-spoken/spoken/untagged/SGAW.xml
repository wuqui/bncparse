<u n="1785" who="S0516">wind farms</u>
<u n="1786" who="S0515" trans="overlap">anyway anyway</u>
<u n="1787" who="S0511" trans="overlap">what about people liking them or not liking them?</u>

<u n="1790" who="S0511" trans="overlap">oh I think they're rather beautiful</u>
<u n="1791" who="S0515">the thing about this particular one</u>

<u n="1795" who="S0511" trans="overlap"><trunc>y</trunc>you saying it's always grey</u>

<u n="1799" who="S0515">you know some of these really big <unclear/></u>
<u n="1800" who="S0512" trans="overlap">there is probably</u>
<u n="1801" who="S0511" trans="overlap">probably there might be a reason so that birds don't like fly into them</u>
<u n="1802" who="S0516" trans="overlap">well there might be reason</u>
<u n="1803" who="S0511" trans="overlap">or something cos like one of the issues with wind turbines is about birds flying into them and bats there's an issue about bats</u>
<u n="1804" who="S0515">see this particular wind farm is quite interesting</u>
<u n="1805" who="S0512">there would be an issue about bats</u>
<u n="1806" who="S0515" trans="overlap">cos it's massive</u>
<u n="1807" who="S0511">mm</u>
<u n="1808" who="S0512">cos they're moving</u>
<u n="1809" who="S0511">yeah</u>
<u n="1810" who="S0512">so it'll <unclear>echo</unclear> <anon type="place"/> it'll miss it and they'll fly straight into it</u>
<u n="1811" who="S0511" trans="overlap">yes and er one I worked with years and years ago the bat thing was a really big deal yeah sorry mum</u>
<u n="1812" who="S0512" trans="overlap">did they fix that?</u>
<u n="1813" who="S0511">er they didn't they had to make the case and I think the case has now been won that yeah more bats do die but er you just have live with this sort of thing erm</u>
<u n="1814" who="S0512" trans="overlap">yeah you can make a cage</u>
<u n="1815" who="S0511">no no a case not a cage</u>
<u n="1816" who="S0512">could make</u>
<u n="1817" who="S0511" trans="overlap">you could make cage</u>
<u n="1818" who="S0512">yeah I'm thinking</u>
<u n="1819" who="S0511" trans="overlap">but I think you'd have to know that bats were erm</u>
<u n="1820" who="S0516">but bats are so small the cage the wires would have to be</u>
<u n="1821" who="S0511" trans="overlap">really fine</u>
<u n="1822" who="S0516">and then the wind would be</u>
<u n="1823" who="S0512" trans="overlap">and they would <unclear/></u>
<u n="1824" who="S0511" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1825" who="S0516" trans="overlap">diffused</u>
<u n="1826" who="S0511">yeah</u>
<u n="1827" who="S0512">mm</u>
<u n="1828" who="S0511">I <trunc>thi</trunc> I think the point is that not all well some of our bats I think are cos we've got lots of different species I think some of them a are short but not er like there are other things <trunc>wi</trunc> there's other problems about them like there's nowhere for them to roost and things so there aren't enough fallen down barns or something so there are other more significant issues for bats than wind turbines but yeah it is a bit sorry mum and this particular wind turbine</u>
<u n="1829" who="S0515" trans="overlap">oh no <trunc>d</trunc> this particular well I <trunc>mea</trunc> I I don't know because <pause dur="short"/> I know she was secretary to the group or whatever</u>
<u n="1830" who="S0511">mm</u>
<u n="1831" who="S0515" trans="overlap">so she's <unclear>deeply</unclear> and so I I've never heard the details of it all and <unclear/> but this particular wind farm I think is very big</u>
<u n="1832" who="S0511">mm</u>
<u n="1833" who="S0515">the proposal in in this flat bog area</u>
<u n="1834" who="S0511"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1835" who="S0515">and and the thing is that <pause dur="short"/> they can create quite a lot of noise near to habitation so buzz the buzz</u>
<u n="1836" who="S0511">yeah</u>
<u n="1837" who="S0515">yeah that's one of the things but then the other interesting thing is that Ireland doesn't benefit directly from the power the power is actually being piped back over there</u>
<u n="1838" who="S0511">yeah but that's also true of any any energy that we create here in the UK exactly the same happens so when they say that we'll have nuclear power and then it'll make energy cheaper it isn't true it goes into the European wide grid and er and</u>
<u n="1839" who="S0515" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1840" who="S0511" trans="overlap">and then it does comes out a different way so it's not like we control our power either and that is unfortunate</u>
<u n="1841" who="S0515" trans="overlap">so <unclear>that I think er</unclear></u>
<u n="1842" who="S0511">because I think local control of power would be a really good thing but</u>
<u n="1843" who="S0515" trans="overlap">well <unclear/></u>
<u n="1844" who="S0511" trans="overlap">it doesn't happen yeah</u>
<u n="1845" who="S0515">er for people in that part of the country er that they're not even going to have the power themselves</u>
<u n="1846" who="S0511">but I stood under a wind turbine a while ago and I don't remember it making any noise at all but I know they say <trunc>th</trunc> cos I wonder why they don't just build them out at sea cos then they won't <trunc>up</trunc>upset anybody and then</u>
<u n="1847" who="S0512">it's quite difficult to build out at sea</u>
<u n="1848" who="S0511">well it's more difficult to build out at sea and then one of the real problems with energy is the how much is lost in the transmission</u>
<u n="1849" who="S0512">mm</u>
<u n="1850" who="S0511" trans="overlap">right that's when the modes of transmission and stuff but also apparently if you've got this <trunc>wha</trunc> the sea ones are really big and so they the vibrations they they are <trunc>c</trunc>causing problems with fish or whatever</u>
<u n="1851" who="S0515" trans="overlap">oh right yes</u>
<u n="1852" who="S0511" trans="overlap">I mean you can sort of picture it it might vibrate and</u>
<u n="1853" who="S0515" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="1854" who="S0511">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="1855" who="S0515" trans="overlap">oh yeah you can imagine</u>
