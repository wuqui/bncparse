<u n="96" who="S0115">dunno <pause dur="short"/> but yeah um it's pretty weird if you think about <pause dur="short"/> well it's the sort of thing you see on Horrible Histories is is the  is the  fact that histories were horrible in in</u>
<u n="97" who="S0037" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0115">you know you'd get burned for like</u>
<u n="99" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> not agreeing</u>
<u n="100" who="S0115">mind you I suppose like a lot of the times they just made stuff up like if they didn't like someone</u>
<u n="101" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0115">they would make up you know trumped-up charges</u>
<u n="103" who="S0037" trans="overlap">telling them she's a witch yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0115">you know the classic uh</u>
<u n="105" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0115">trumped-up <pause dur="short"/> uh <pause dur="short"/> You know</u>
<u n="107" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you just don't know</u>
<u n="108" who="S0115" trans="overlap">think they were sort of burned people being burned probably uh</u>
<u n="109" who="S0037">but um</u>
<u n="110" who="S0115">but if you wanna make money in these hard times televise public execution</u>
<u n="111" who="S0037">ah that's a horrible idea</u>
<u n="112" who="S0115" trans="overlap">pay pay <trunc>subs</trunc> you know subscription subscription service</u>
<u n="113" who="S0037">people would though wouldn't they?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0115">yep <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="115" who="S0037">voyeurism?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well I I'm not in favour uh I'm not in favour of it but I think in as people get increasingly desperate for money perhaps that's something that'll happen</u>
<u n="117" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but I mean the television's going like that anyway like some of that stuff that</u>
<u n="118" who="S0115" trans="overlap">oh yeah well I think we think I don't know if this is just because I'm getting old or</u>
<u n="119" who="S0037">mm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0115">which I am</u>
<u n="121" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0115">or if it genuinely is getting worse but <pause dur="short"/> but I do sometimes think you know that things are getting more desperate for money and more sort of violent</u>
<u n="123" who="S0037" trans="overlap">Ohh <pause dur="short"/> but did you see that thing in Syria? Where so it was the the rebels had captured some guy who was from the government <pause dur="short"/> and strung him to a tree?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0115">no I haven't no what what what have you  what have you  been reading?</u>
<u n="125" who="S0037" trans="overlap">maybe it was when I was abroad <pause dur="short"/> ah it's because I think it was when I was abroad because obviously I was just watching you know</u>
<u n="126" who="S0115">yeah <trunc>c</trunc> <trunc>per</trunc> perhaps they wouldn't show that in England because in England we we're only given sort of very positive views of the rebels we're <trunc>n</trunc> we're not given</u>
<u n="127" who="S0037" trans="overlap">foreign news <pause dur="short"/> and anyway the <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> it was on <trunc>C</trunc> aye it was on CNN and they were like</u>
<u n="128" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I don't  I don't  know if we'd be given any anything that negative about the rebels in England <pause dur="short"/> although I may be wrong</u>
<u n="129" who="S0037" trans="overlap">so it was on CNN and they were like um Oh they were like Oh you know they've captured this guy who's supposed to have <pause dur="short"/> I mean there was things that this guy's supposed to have done this army guy <pause dur="short"/> You know like killed a child and whatever <pause dur="short"/> but basically there was this footage on the news and before they put they said Oh by the way this might be slightly upsetting <pause dur="short"/> And it was like this man strung up from a tree and you could see his face it well nothing was blurred out <pause dur="short"/> nothing <pause dur="short"/> so it was his dead body like <trunc>w</trunc> swaying swaying in the breeze</u>
<u n="130" who="S0115" trans="overlap">oh dead body <pause dur="short"/> so they'd already killed him extrajudicially like</u>
<u n="131" who="S0037">was he wasn't dying at that moment but he would <trunc>already</trunc> he had already died like but he was just</u>
<u n="132" who="S0115">they'd already killed him?</u>
<u n="133" who="S0037">and he was just hanging with his tree <pause dur="short"/> and they were all standing there with their weapons like posing next to him</u>
<u n="134" who="S0115">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0037">so</u>
<u n="136" who="S0115">very similar to medieval uh</u>
<u n="137" who="S0037">exactly</u>
<u n="138" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well not necessarily medieval</u>
<u n="139" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but what I'm saying is that was on the news <pause dur="short"/> like</u>
<u n="140" who="S0115">CNN but I dunno if it's <pause dur="short"/> well yeah I mean the Gadaffi thing was on uh</u>
<u n="141" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0115">the the shooting uh</u>
<u n="143" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0115">pretty pretty brutal really uh I don't know if um <pause dur="short"/> did they use to show that sort of stuff? I think things sort of got more censored <pause dur="short"/> I suppose like nowadays uh you know there's there's there is a tendency towards more um freedom of speech freedom of broadcasting and that that kind of does lead I think to to the or a lowering of the standards</u>
<u n="145" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah but that's a bit extreme <pause dur="short"/> I don't think you need to see people hanging from trees <pause dur="short"/> and like <pause dur="short"/> when they killed</u>
<u n="146" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well it could get far worse and we only have to look back in into the horrible history to see just how horrible it could get again in this country</u>
<u n="147" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah but I don't wanna see it <pause dur="short"/> I don't wanna see</u>
<u n="148" who="S0115" trans="overlap">remember Mussolini in <trunc>I</trunc> Italy I mean that was that may be they said he he deserved that but like that that that was like a</u>
<u n="149" who="S0037">no I know but</u>
<u n="150" who="S0115" trans="overlap">he was like strung up and his body was like passed around you know hung up <pause dur="short"/> decapitated and hung upside and stuff <pause dur="short"/> stuff like that</u>
<u n="151" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well I know <pause dur="short"/> oh they used to do all sorts of things didn't they like <pause dur="short"/> drawing them and stuff so when they were like they would hang them but not till they died and then take them down and pull pull the middle bits out and</u>
<u n="152" who="S0115" trans="overlap">oh well that's I mean that's that's supposedly illegal in the modern um <pause dur="short"/> supposedly uh uh illegal illegal to torture in the modern you know uh so called uh free Western world or whatever it is <pause dur="short"/> supposedly illegal to  supposedly illegal to  torture although they they do do it anyway but they just don't admit it <pause dur="short"/> so I guess it's like</u>
<u n="153" who="S0037">but I think</u>
<u n="154" who="S0115">there's there's always <pause dur="short"/> history's horrible <pause dur="short"/> I suppose the present will be horrible uh like if you</u>
<u n="155" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but you get horrible stuff anyway</u>
<u n="156" who="S0115">I think one of the big problems like violence <pause dur="short"/> look at that dive <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="157" who="S0037">I know it was proper dive wasn't it I was thinking that wasn't even a penalty no way</u>
<u n="158" who="S0115" trans="overlap">that's a real that uh <unclear/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="160" who="S0115">yeah fair enough</u>
<u n="161" who="S0037">doesn't matter</u>
<u n="162" who="S0115">oh yeah so</u>
<u n="163" who="S0037">it was the right decision</u>
<u n="164" who="S0115">no I mean I think like violence is is a  is a  huge problem and uh</u>
<u n="165" who="S0037" trans="overlap">ooh <pause dur="short"/> that was <unclear/></u>
<u n="166" who="S0115">and it comes from government it comes from individual it comes from you know mobs just just come up and uh</u>

<u n="243" who="S0115">can just have <pause dur="short"/> like it just happens like people don't seem to <pause dur="short"/> there doesn't seem to be a way a mechanism of of humans to stop violence like <pause dur="short"/> if they were as great a species as as they claim to be <pause dur="short"/> well we <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="244" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I suppose my point that I was trying to make was that I don't need to see it on TV if someone like that that American guy who like shot all those villages right <pause dur="short"/> it's fine to tell me that an American guy went to a village and shot them and then once they were dead he tried to burn them <pause dur="short"/> I don't need to see the scorch marks on the ground or the bodies in the back of a van or a pool of blood like I don't think</u>
<u n="245" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well I <trunc>th</trunc> are you complaining about the coverage or the violence itself you seem to be complaining about the coverage</u>
<u n="246" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well both both really</u>
<u n="247" who="S0115">so you're happy with the violence but no as long as it's <unclear/></u>
<u n="248" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no I've just said both haven't I <pause dur="short"/> I'm I'm complaining about both but what I'm saying is</u>
<u n="249" who="S0115" trans="overlap">is it cos I was talking about like the violence itself as</u>
<u n="250" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I don't see why you should perpetuate it on the TV I think it's like</u>
<u n="251" who="S0115">oh yeah well if you're taking the point that that that like that that can cause more violence yeah</u>
<u n="252" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well they say it don't they like they say if there's like a serial <pause dur="short"/> it glamorizes it doesn't it like?</u>
<u n="253" who="S0115" trans="overlap">it can  it can  yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah like like we saw on um Charlie Brooker's programme</u>
<u n="254" who="S0037" trans="overlap">if you're a serial killer <pause dur="short"/> and like they put the splash your face around everywhere and make him into some sort of demigod for like other crazy folk</u>
<u n="255" who="S0115">yeah indeed but then of course violence starts otherwise without TV <pause dur="short"/> um violence starts</u>
<u n="256" who="S0037">that's quite a good advert</u>
<u n="257" who="S0037">violence starts  everywhere I suppose</u>
<u n="258" who="S0037">I like those cars that have got them big sunroofs like that</u>

<u n="260" who="S0037" trans="overlap">me dad's got them</u>
<u n="261" who="S0115">and I looked and I found uh a lot of the violence is to do with um places where there's drugs produced or</u>
<u n="262" who="S0037" trans="overlap">Congo? Ah yeah</u>
<u n="263" who="S0115">also gangs and and in it involved in the transport of drugs um <pause dur="short"/> so so large amounts of money definitely <pause dur="short"/> particularly large amounts of black market money</u>
<u n="264" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="265" who="S0115"><trunc>Abs</trunc> absolutely attracts violence to it</u>
<u n="266" who="S0037" trans="overlap">like um like that programme we watched about that guy who was like he got done over <pause dur="short"/> and he <trunc>u</trunc> was that in Peru? Or Chile?</u>

<u n="271" who="S0115">well that's that's not a case of violence it's a case of stupidity and uh</u>
<u n="272" who="S0037">it's pretty stupid</u>
<u n="273" who="S0115">drugs <pause dur="short"/> it but it is something that goes on I mean uh what was he yeah he was from <pause dur="short"/> he he moved to Florida or something</u>

<u n="275" who="S0115">Florida seems to be a real hotbed of of just just craziness I think but uh um</u>
<u n="276" who="S0037">are you?</u>
<u n="277" who="S0115" trans="overlap">but <trunc>i</trunc> in the news obviously we we had the we've had the shooting in Florida just now and we've also have seen in the news you know like those two English guys that got drunk and ran into the wrong neighbourhood and got shot just for being just for simply being in the neighbourhood</u>

<u n="284" who="S0037">just cos you've heard about them like</u>
<u n="285" who="S0115">well I think it is because and uh this is what I'm on about is that the drugs route you see</u>

<u n="287" who="S0115">the drugs that</u>

<u n="291" who="S0115">is is particularly I mean Florida particularly because perhaps it's got such a big coastline <pause dur="short"/> lots of places where um potential sort of smuggling can go on I think um <pause dur="short"/> and and obviously it attracts people from um <pause dur="short"/> I mean <trunc>y</trunc> looking at that guy you were talking about who got done over <pause dur="short"/> basically he was in Florida and and this this beautiful</u>
