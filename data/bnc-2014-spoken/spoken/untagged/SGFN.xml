<u n="274" who="S0240" trans="overlap">well that's what he that's what he's gonna try and do</u>
<u n="275" who="S0478" trans="overlap">do you know we had some brilliant people to do some jobs around the house that needed doing <pause dur="short"/> erm like you know the the sealant on the shower and that sort of thing upstairs and electrical jobs and</u>
<u n="276" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="277" who="S0478">erm and he was saying about the government are just cutting back on all the apprenticeship opportunities</u>
<u n="278" who="S0240" trans="overlap">they're meant to being</u>
<u n="279" who="S0478">they said they'd love to have an <trunc>apprenticesh</trunc> but you know apprentice to work with them</u>
<u n="280" who="S0240">I thought they were doing the opposite I thought they were increasing</u>
<u n="281" who="S0478" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="293" who="S0478" trans="overlap">well exactly and I think I think also it it you know it if you say you've got to go to university to study to be an electrician or a plumber it kind of devalues it in a way</u>
<u n="294" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="295" who="S0478">because <vocal desc="cough"/> what they really need to do is be out on jobs with people</u>
