<u n="738" who="S0230">oh</u>
<u n="739" who="S0198">so he <trunc>didn</trunc> he ended up getting less <pause dur="short"/> I mean he got most all the basic stuff but I don't think he got like I his loan's slightly more than mine by about a thousand pounds and I think that's the grants that I got that I never had to pay back <pause dur="short"/> but I mean he still got the full loan for everything else basically anyone can get that</u>

<u n="759" who="S0230" trans="overlap">the first year you was at uni we had I can't remember how much it was but because our combined wages wasn't a huge amount it was a reduced amount we had to pay</u>
<u n="760" who="S0198" trans="overlap">okay yeah <pause dur="short"/> see maybe he had to pay all his tuition then initially</u>
<u n="761" who="S0230">yeah</u>
<u n="762" who="S0198">I know as it went on my tuition got a little less maybe cos once you stopped working once dad stopped working</u>
<u n="763" who="S0230">well yeah and I obviously I'm</u>
<u n="764" who="S0198" trans="overlap">you stopped at some point altogether as well</u>

<u n="766" who="S0198" trans="overlap">no yeah exactly</u>
<u n="767" who="S0230">it's all like sixty pound a week I think it was in the</u>
<u n="768" who="S0198">so I didn't think I I don't think I had to pay too much in tuition at all my loan was mainly for <trunc>liv</trunc> it was for living</u>
<u n="769" who="S0229">down</u>
<u n="770" who="S0198">it was to pay for the rent</u>
<u n="771" who="S0229">down</u>

<u n="774" who="S0198">towards living expenses</u>
<u n="775" who="S0229">don't</u>
<u n="776" who="S0230" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="777" who="S0198">it's not really that's the thing in America they have these huge loans and it's because their tuition is so high <pause dur="short"/> and like our loans are kind substantial but only because we've just paid that on rent and stuff I don't know what they do about accommodation I mean I guess they still have to make money to pay for that as well</u>
<u n="778" who="S0230">but our tuition fees are a lot higher now than when you was there</u>
<u n="779" who="S0198">a lot higher that's a joke that's an understatement they're disgusting now</u>
<u n="780" who="S0230">what are they now?</u>
<u n="781" who="S0198">about nine thousand a year <pause dur="short"/> nine thousand pounds a year when I did when I went to university it was twelve hundred <pause dur="short"/> we</u>
<u n="782" who="S0230" trans="overlap">and then they went up to three thousand</u>
<u n="783" who="S0198" trans="overlap">we</u>
<u n="784" who="S0230">didn't they?</u>
<u n="785" who="S0198">yeah they</u>
<u n="786" who="S0230" trans="overlap">you just missed that didn't you?</u>

<u n="788" who="S0230">yeah</u>
<u n="789" who="S0198">but nine er between eight er universities now can charge between nine and up to twelve thousand I think <pause dur="short"/> but I think they're all about nine thousand a year which is what <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is going to be paying for hers</u>
<u n="790" who="S0230">mm</u>
<u n="791" who="S0198">that's an expensive degree <pause dur="short"/> it's a joke considering so much Europe is still completely free <pause dur="short"/> we've completely in one year like within a couple of years basically since David Cameron's come in just flipped and like education we've completely copied the American system</u>
<u n="792" who="S0230" trans="overlap">the Americans</u>
<u n="793" who="S0198">and realised how much more money some of the loans the student loans that were <trunc>t</trunc> taken out ten years ago or so they've sold those <trunc>li</trunc> loans off to private companies so now they <trunc>lo</trunc> those people don't deal with the government loan student loan company any more they're private companies dealing with them and they can introduce new rules about how you should pay back I don't want my loan if my loan goes off to a private company I'm screwed like I'm having to pay that back instantly <pause dur="short"/> they shouldn't be allowed to do stuff like that but of course when you're eighteen and you sign it you don't know what you're signing and even if you did you don't have a choice</u>
<u n="794" who="S0230">no</u>
<u n="795" who="S0198">they just grab you by the balls basically <pause dur="short"/> which is what has <trunc>hap</trunc> well you know so I just I wouldn't want to be in <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s position particularly</u>
<u n="796" who="S0230">I I mean how when you think how it's changed when when <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> went to uni she got paid for going</u>
<u n="797" who="S0198">I know</u>
<u n="798" who="S0230" trans="overlap">to university she had grants thrown at her</u>

<u n="808" who="S0230">no</u>
<u n="809" who="S0198">just cos of your level of education and the attitude of the family</u>
<u n="810" who="S0230">yeah</u>
<u n="811" who="S0198">but yeah it's a shame I guess too many people started to go to <trunc>un</trunc> they they just turned it more into a business I suppose</u>
<u n="812" who="S0230">like everything</u>
<u n="813" who="S0198">yeah wanted everyone to go to university</u>
<u n="814" who="S0230">it's like I know it's completely opposite but it's like the care home it it's not a caring profession now it's a business it's there to make money for the</u>
