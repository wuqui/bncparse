<u n="1" who="S0261"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> talking great ideas <pause dur="short"/> and at the moment <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was gonna spill the beans about her great idea and something to do with the <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and a chiropractor</u>
<u n="2" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah so you could like you could the first ever video you can video somebody <pause dur="short"/> and then you go right how do we know each other? we know each other because this is our connection point <pause dur="short"/> then you explore common interests and then somebody says oh and then my friend or my lecturer or my mum or my dad or something like this right? <pause dur="short"/> and then you go okay <pause dur="short"/> would you ask your friend person whoever if we can erm if they wanna be videoed and you go yeah alright okay so straight on yes or no <pause dur="short"/> then the person agrees or not and they come along and they're videoed and then they're talking about their connection points and then you've got this kind of little cluster which is about how people are actually forming networks either over the internet or in physical world or in a virtual world or whatever so when it comes to it the person who you originally started talking to was the person you were genuinely interested in their story but the backdrop story is how people actually help each other and what they're trying to achieve and how you've got this common interests with people so it's kind of like you've got the main character in a film <pause dur="short"/> but you've got these secondary characters and they are actually driving the story forward <pause dur="short"/> so it's kinda like you can have a little bubble thing where you've got this world of this is about <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s social networks are these people and the way that these people are operating within this <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s world <pause dur="short"/> is what's important to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and that's how things get done okay? so what's the outcome of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> talking to his lecturer is his lecturer said <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you've got a fantastic idea I think this should be an undergraduate research project and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> then says oh if I hadn't had that lecturer and been able to talk to him physically I wouldn't have been able to get to the point that I needed to be at</u>
<u n="3" who="S0261">okay so that's great in the context of what we saw as an er that example on the foundation erm for the job for a developer which was erm that they were displaying that people were happy to help and so what you're doing is you are providing people through this film's video this chat with somebody a storyline that demonstrates to somebody well how I could go about it so they might not be aware of but they can see through somebody else's example erm if I went and had a chat to my lecturer about the idea I have and I get over a particular barrier that I've got then I might be able to er er well I'll I will be able to find out and know whether it's something that's feasible that I can go forward with</u>
<u n="4" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="5" who="S0261">or I can have a chat to that guy</u>
<u n="6" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="7" who="S0261">and get to know him et cetera et cetera</u>
<u n="8" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="9" who="S0261">and the other thing that you were talking about is is kind <trunc>o</trunc> er I suppose related to network theory in a way isn't it? erm er I don't know a lot about it but <pause dur="short"/> it's interesting because you could allow your your interview process maybe over the period of a week you could do one each day and could allow that just to erm organically go on a certain direction</u>
<u n="10" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0261">and then you could sum it up at the end of the week with either a Google Hangout type thing where they all get together <pause dur="short"/> and you might find that none of them know each other as a group but each one knows each other on a respective connection down the path</u>
<u n="12" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0261">and yet they have some common thing in and that you can draw together which is what their network actually means</u>
<u n="14" who="S0262">yeah it's like a Chinese whispers like you could do say you know Monday to Friday or or whatever <pause dur="short"/> so you start out with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> on Monday and you end up with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> by Friday and then you interview <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> on Friday and you go okay so you're coming here through a connections of other people who's your connection? well my connection is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> okay right well we met <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> on Wednesday so we know a little bit about him so tell me okay what's going on there? oh right well we're trying to solve a problem okay this is the problem right good so let's talk about it and then it's like okay <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> er not <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> have you erm met <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> from Monday? no but I can do now because I know how this works I know that we're connected through the social media or we are connected because we were introduced physically at a caf√© whatever so what you're doing is this you're reflecting back on the initial person who started off the here's a problem and then you've actually shown how people are coming on board sharing their common interests and sharing their common concerns <pause dur="short"/> and that they're showing that they can go back to that person and have the connection that they didn't originally have had the videos not been made <pause dur="short"/> cos the videos in a way this is the narrative it's pushing the story forward</u>
<u n="15" who="S0261"><trunc>ye</trunc> yeah and er well you could put it in the context of the six degrees of freedom thing where you go I'll run a video from Monday to Saturday <pause dur="short"/> yeah? so you interview</u>
<u n="16" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0261">a person each day</u>
<u n="18" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="19" who="S0261">six six times so that means the person at the end of the process has six degrees separated from the first person</u>
<u n="20" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0261">and then you can explore all of that connection</u>
<u n="22" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0261">but what does that actually mean? what does that provide people?</u>
<u n="24" who="S0262">well it provides them with erm <pause dur="short"/> I suppose insights into how people</u>
<u n="25" who="S0261">communicate</u>
<u n="26" who="S0262">communicate and make connections and what they do with the connections cos it's easy to just connect with someone on Facebook <pause dur="short"/> but if you're unless you're actually making some value attached to that connection and really trying to understand where these other people are coming from like what are they what are their common interests what are they call common concerns is there something that you can work together on <pause dur="short"/> that you've actually found out now that you'd like to work together on and do something together?</u>
<u n="27" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="28" who="S0262">and that is a community that's building something at least at least that's showing a growth in the area that technology does have connectedness but what you do with that connectedness that counts</u>
<u n="29" who="S0261">and and there's a big thing that you feed off that thread which is erm all of those elements of the student-ish type things which are about your your learning your motivation your erm getting on and doing it your experience your sharing your community your networking and all of those <pause dur="short"/> you know there's a must be a core of elements which are all encompassed in that erm <pause dur="short"/> which allow you to explore having something and getting from er taking a journey from here to here <pause dur="short"/> and you can use it in the example of the guy who's been recommended to do something by a lecturer because he's had an idea which is connected to this thread</u>
<u n="30" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0261">of people</u>
<u n="32" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0261">or whatever</u>
<u n="34" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it it I think it works on the level</u>
<u n="35" who="S0261" trans="overlap">you could take it in that circle</u>
<u n="36" who="S0262">that the story the narrative is driving is driving the growth so it's it's actually other people who are just er who stories every time they contribute something that story is being you have to have a good sense of narrative but in a way people are driving their own narrative it's not me or you who is sitting there going okay in the next video we want this to happen it's actually going to be quite impromptu</u>
<u n="37" who="S0261">well and that kind of goes back to what we were talking about erm kinda <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s mechanism of of marketing and advertising and storytelling journalism</u>
<u n="38" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0261">and <pause dur="short"/> you know imagine if you had a community and a of X amount of people in them however many let's say several thousand and that you posted this as a as an experiment and you said that within this community we're gonna explore this idea but you're not gonna tell them what the idea is</u>
<u n="40" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0261">and that on this particular week we would like everybody to <trunc>m</trunc> in their minds make themself available in case on an impromptu basis we're gonna interview</u>
<u n="42" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0261">and then you start at one point and you don't know where this going to go</u>
<u n="44" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0261">but it's gonna thread through the community and come up with something</u>
<u n="46" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0261">and so you draw the whole community into this whole this this observation of it all</u>
<u n="48" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0261">and that <pause dur="short"/> that creates the ball within which all of this network conversation must go go on</u>
<u n="50" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but what's what's different about it is that you get a sense of <trunc>con</trunc> continuity cos we've got lots and lots of videos up on the internet but they're one stop shop videos they've got the beginning they've got a middle and the end but that's just one video it's trying to tell a story in two minutes something like this</u>
<u n="51" who="S0261">well I was going to <trunc>sa</trunc> well let's <trunc>ye</trunc> sorry I'll let you carry on yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0262">so what I'm saying is that you know <trunc>th</trunc><trunc>th</trunc>the the the well the reason why we're using videos is not because we just wanna make a video that's two minutes long we're actually using a video just to simply capture forms of communication the way that we communicate erm and that's the only reason why we're videoing it is because normally you sit down and have a conversation and you can see the person unless you're on the telephone</u>
<u n="53" who="S0261">yeah erm I think it's also got the potential to demonstrate a different way of going about doing something and it erm if you take that idea of a short video which tells you a lot in a short period of time yeah and then you scale that to the size of a whole community of several thousand people</u>
<u n="54" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0261">right and you so you're stretching that story from from being this short to taking a longer period of time but scaling it in such a way that that the learning you get out of this bigger thing is massive compared to this tiny little piece of time</u>
<u n="56" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's true</u>
<u n="57" who="S0261">even if it is just the the difference between two minutes to a week <pause dur="short"/> that <trunc>s</trunc> that scales by <trunc>m</trunc>many tens of thousands</u>
<u n="58" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0261">right?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0261">so you could you could say you've got this mechanism by which erm you could even call it a business thread er way to er brainstorm ideas such that by the end of a week you've come up with some kind of proactive brand new idea that you could use as a thread to follow on down a path to start a new business or something</u>
<u n="62" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0261">er whatever I <trunc>m</trunc> who knows I'm just <trunc>free</trunc> freefalling with this erm <pause dur="short"/> and er I I can kind of see er er I can see that it's an interesting experiment</u>
<u n="64" who="S0262">it's the difference between it just made me think of quite a few things that <pause dur="short"/> we were doing filmmaking wise back in the nineties that actually I think it was Ridley Scott did pull off erm he's done two I think in <trunc>th</trunc> there's you know both of them on the internet I think it's just the day in the life <pause dur="short"/> and he first started it in the UK where he wanted everyone at just at certain a day to film their day their individual day and they had to send their footage in and they pored through all of this footage and in the end they they made a story out of it they made a narrative <pause dur="short"/> and the other one that he did was a world one so people from all around the could send in a day in the life of and they <trunc>h</trunc> somehow incredibly put a narrative together which was fucking powerful</u>
<u n="65" who="S0261">I I remember this yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0262">now the</u>
<u n="67" who="S0261" trans="overlap">I've seen that</u>
<u n="68" who="S0262"><trunc>rever</trunc> what we're doing is the reverse we're not we're not getting quantity to start with and then condensing into quality we're starting off with quality <pause dur="short"/> to start with and it's going to scale into quantity we'll hopefully without losing the quality <pause dur="short"/> so rather than editing it we're gonna be growing it <pause dur="long"/> so it starts with the day in the life of but in the life of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> knows these people and these people come in and go yeah I've got a day in the life of myself let's just say and then I've brought these other people in because these people are in my life and these are the sort of things we're talking about at the moment and this is the sort of things that we wanna try and achieve together <pause dur="short"/> and these are the sort of resources that we need and then ah that's the key because if you start to get people talking about the things that they need you can start to see what resources they need</u>
<u n="69" who="S0261">and that's what you pin is your your products</u>
<u n="70" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="71" who="S0261">you know you you go you get them to chat first</u>
<u n="72" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0261">you could you could just do this as an experiment tomorrow</u>
<u n="74" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0261">and you could see what comes out of it and you could erm synthesise it all and you could go okay I can see five products there that we could do tomorrow</u>
<u n="76" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0261">and that and and then you can so those five ideas you're going to carry out some kind of analysis on to decide which one you're gonna go with</u>
<u n="78" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I think that's a great idea because erm like <pause dur="short"/> if you if you even found that you needed two things or three things by the end of the week to solve a thematic problem that people have come in to solve erm or even just to talk about what they <trunc>s</trunc> this what they see as the problem communicate what the problem is is the first thing <pause dur="short"/> they uncover that they need some things then you can have the on the Sunday you could have like a the video which summarises what the resources need to be in terms of er of all you know solving the problem so you don't have to go and watch all six videos you can just go straight to Sunday and Sunday is going well now we know what the problem is we now know what we need to do to solve the problem but we need these things and those people who come in at a later stage can watch that video and they're like <pause dur="short"/> oh okay <vocal desc="laugh"/> I can do that I can offer this I can co-create these things with these people I'm gonna jump into their world and I'm going to attach myself to these people who are working on this particular thing and then I can grow you know I can offer my services I can grow business I can do whatever I want with these people <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="79" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0262">and we what we can do is we can cherry-pick the ones that we wanna offer ourselves so you can say straight up hey guys like thing is is that this is our areas of expertise like English language stuff that's what I can help out with erm I can help out with <pause dur="short"/> study skill stuff because I'm a learning skills advisor but there are other things on the website that I won't necessarily be able to help out with because I don't have that area of expertise so people should jump in where they feel that they have the areas of expertise and want to get some experience</u>
<u n="81" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and that goes back to what you saw there are people displaying what their skill base is and saying happy to help and that immediately provides a mechanism for people to connect</u>
<u n="82" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0261">and <trunc>y</trunc> you are obviously building a profile and stuff like that blah-blah-blah-blah-blah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0261">erm that provides an ongoing network of of which is kind of <pause dur="short"/> it it's a more streamlined version of of a Facebook of a <trunc>s</trunc> LinkedIn of a you know</u>
<u n="86" who="S0262">well the other thing is is that you can help <trunc>peo</trunc></u>
<u n="87" who="S0261" trans="overlap">it's a more it's a more day-to-day live mechanism</u>
<u n="88" who="S0262">it it's an evidence base so that when you go to get a job <pause dur="short"/> erm and you haven't yet had any experience because one ways or another you haven't really got experience yet erm you can show people that yeah you have to use your CV to sell yourself but one way of doing that is by evidencing the types of ways that you've been working collaboratively which is one thing that's hard to evidence and I would even go so far to push through another product which is <pause dur="short"/> in the in the in the media world we use and <trunc>pho</trunc> <trunc>photo</trunc> I know photography if you wanna be a photographer you have to have your photographs as a portfolio</u>
<u n="89" who="S0261" trans="overlap">your portfolio mm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0262">erm if you wanna be a filmmaker you have to have er what they call a show reel</u>
<u n="91" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0262">there's nothing wrong with the idea of pushing through a product for young people which is how do I sell myself without using the stereotypical CV which is very hard to really make yourself look appealing</u>
<u n="93" who="S0261">okay so that's where the attraction is for our idea all of this is contained within our our framework okay?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0261" trans="overlap">people can only access it through our framework</u>
<u n="96" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0261">so they can only reference our framework to their employer to demonstrate this is what I've done as a part of this product</u>
<u n="98" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0261">we own the product</u>
<u n="100" who="S0262">oh okay</u>
<u n="101" who="S0261">yeah? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0262">yeah it's an exploratory product and it's not it's not obviously <trunc>ye</trunc> either if it will work but in some areas it will work in the in the less traditional areas it will work cos you could you could actually evidence it by taking parts of the video parts of the actual text that people have written <trunc>arou</trunc> around what you've been doing your work any evidence that's collated you can then find a way to put that into er erm what I would call a digital <trunc>op</trunc> CV I don't really know what that means</u>
<u n="103" who="S0261">yeah well we have to <unclear/> CV</u>
<u n="104" who="S0262" trans="overlap">something CV yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0261">yeah <pause dur="short"/> because I mean the reality of of the the traditional CV is is that it's antiquated</u>
<u n="106" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0261">and so I'm sure erm</u>
<u n="108" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and it's hard for young people to write anything on it</u>
<u n="109" who="S0261">I'm sure in creative the creative world I mean I I was listening to how some people actively engage in interview their people they want to work for them right? and these are you know and they're obviously trying to bring very bright people on board but I have never ever come across anybody who was interviewed in such a way and</u>
<u n="110" who="S0262" trans="overlap">ah see that's actually really clever too because if we start off with the interview thing that you know there's the person who's interviewing like me <pause dur="short"/> you can see how the person answers the questions right? and that's kind of like a skill is answering questions that are really impromptu questions you don't know where you're going with them it's what happens in an interview</u>
<u n="111" who="S0261">and that's the great thing about Mixergy is and</u>
<u n="112" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0261">and and it er provides that it's <trunc>h</trunc> those er this kind of hunting questions so <trunc>e</trunc> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who I was listening to in this interview he wanted what he described he he puts it out there as I wanna get connected with the top people in the one percent and of that one percent I want to hire the one percent of the one percent</u>
<u n="114" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="115" who="S0261">so he's saying the cream of the crop okay?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0261">and so he <trunc>w</trunc> they developed a a a process by which they would interview people quite in depth and they would explore things like erm er what motivated you to apply for your last job? erm what was your interview like? what were your bosses like? erm what kind of interaction did you have with them? and explore things to all sorts of levels that apparently have no real connection with the job</u>
<u n="118" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0261" trans="overlap">it's all about the psychology of</u>
<u n="120" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0261" trans="overlap">how you think how you do things</u>
<u n="122" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="123" who="S0261" trans="overlap">how you relate to people the relationships and what you think okay? and maybe your ability to challenge ideas <pause dur="short"/> and you might <trunc>s</trunc> proudly stand there and go well I resigned from my job because I fundamentally didn't agree with their business approach and this is why</u>
<u n="124" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0261">erm but that provides somebody that mechanism to to to to discuss that scope</u>
<u n="126" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0261">so going back to what you were saying is that erm through these interviews online you can demonstrate those examples by which people can learn from</u>
<u n="128" who="S0262">yeah I think it's better because in a way you have <trunc>con</trunc> you have <trunc>eviden</trunc></u>
<u n="129" who="S0261" trans="overlap">I don't like framing in the context of a CV but it provides people an awareness of communication at that level</u>
<u n="130" who="S0262">er yeah erm <pause dur="short"/> I think what I'm trying to say <pause dur="short"/> is <pause dur="short"/> that <pause dur="long"/> these days if you were being creative about trying to get a job <pause dur="short"/> you could send a company not your CV but or a CV a traditional CV but actually a a creative <pause dur="short"/> content that actually personably you introduce yourself you've got some cuts to the type of things that</u>
<u n="131" who="S0261" trans="overlap">it would just be a website of yourself with a video on it and</u>
<u n="132" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0261">other resources</u>
<u n="134" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0261">and so we're <trunc>p</trunc> <unclear>two point O</unclear> you know</u>
<u n="136" who="S0262"><trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>wh</trunc> whatever</u>
<u n="137" who="S0261" trans="overlap">website</u>
<u n="138" who="S0262">yeah or we could even fashion a product which says look this is actually what you need to do as a kind of format to get yourself across in the best light rather when we saw the <unclear/> if we'd  given them some direction that would have come off better <pause dur="short"/> I know that if I had talked to a couple of those students I would have got a lot better out of them they would have got a lot better out of themselves</u>
<u n="139" who="S0261" trans="overlap">absolutely of course and that would have demonstrated things</u>
<u n="140" who="S0262" trans="overlap">so what I would say is that it is we can encourage that product to come through</u>
<u n="141" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="142" who="S0262">as an exploratory product</u>
<u n="143" who="S0261">that's right</u>
<u n="144" who="S0262">that allows people to be creative co-create because they can then evidence the way that they've worked with their peers the way that they've worked with people who are older than them and most importantly I think the things that they can safely say are their strengths you can almost look someone in the eye and go <pause dur="short"/> I've I <trunc>re</trunc> I believe these are my key strengths <pause dur="short"/> and I've been <trunc>wri</trunc> reading about <pause dur="short"/> videos and why they're so powerful that's why viral videos are so powerful is because seeing is believing</u>
<u n="145" who="S0261">who's saying that?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0262">there's a lot of psychology behind that now that's why everyone wants to make videos and put them on the internet</u>
<u n="147" who="S0261" trans="overlap">there are examples in there though of where seeing wasn't believing in my point of view and</u>
<u n="148" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="149" who="S0261">and and that was because they you know there was like the lady who got <trunc>wh</trunc> who lecturers and her friends <trunc>t</trunc> and you know she interviewed them right? but we don't know who those people are</u>
<u n="150" who="S0262">no</u>
<u n="151" who="S0261">there there's no there's no actual quality behind that <pause dur="short"/> they could just be anybody</u>
<u n="152" who="S0262">but it's a good idea</u>
<u n="153" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0262">and that's actually a really</u>
<u n="155" who="S0261" trans="overlap">but but with that roundedness to it</u>
<u n="156" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0261">it would be a strong idea</u>
<u n="158" who="S0262">well that's a good way of actually showing <pause dur="short"/> investors if there are if we're gonna go to that point we go this is where it's a starting point this is how you would make it look a lot better and the idea is that if you have Creative Commons access on the website people can actually download <pause dur="short"/> only parts of the video where they have been where they've been involved okay? obviously they wouldn't download other parts of the videos where they hadn't been involved cos it wouldn't work but say if there is a video where I am interviewing somebody and they've been particularly articulate about working with people or doing something whatever it is they could edit that take that bit and put it into their their digital CV and then they can reference back that information and say this was an interview that was conducted online about this particular topic and you can see how I answered the questions and this is me and what I really think <pause dur="short"/> so the strength of the interviews will come from firstly from my line of questioning <pause dur="short"/> and secondly from their ability to answer coherently concise-ivly with a you know articulate the main points these are all things that we value still in the world <pause dur="short"/> and a lot of academics tell me or teachers tell me that students are losing this ability to articulate themselves</u>
<u n="159" who="S0261">and that goes back to that lady's <unclear>tip</unclear> talk</u>
<u n="160" who="S0262">but I don't know if that's true</u>
<u n="161" who="S0261" trans="overlap">she <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="162" who="S0262">I mean you know I <trunc>th</trunc> I I don't know if it's true because I generally talk to younger people and I find them very articulate <pause dur="short"/> I mean on a face-to-face I talk to young people all the time on a helpdesk</u>
<u n="163" who="S0261"><trunc>ye</trunc> yeah I think we've got to remember that we're talking about dealing with er people that are at this part and she's probably talking about the wider society</u>
<u n="164" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0261">she's trying to say the eighty percent that are actually otherwise there</u>
<u n="166" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="167" who="S0261">that aren't er you know they aren't at university or dealing in an academic sense are operating in such a way that is like that and you see that in the real world you see that in business you see that on the street you see that on the train you see it on the day-to-day thing simply walking down the street looking at their phone</u>
<u n="168" who="S0262">mm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="169" who="S0261">so you're you're right about the students erm <pause dur="short"/> the they might be articulate but maybe that's because they are at university</u>
<u n="170" who="S0262">okay so like say if we say a dogma is we <trunc>t</trunc> we never edit out</u>
<u n="171" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="172" who="S0262">that means that the <trunc>s</trunc> the person who agrees to take part in the interview erm agrees that it will be unedited and that</u>
<u n="173" who="S0261">well that shapes the the rules for the interview which is quite simple if you asked them a question that they're unhappy answering they will just say I'm not gonna answer that</u>
<u n="174" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="175" who="S0261">and and that's fine and you do find examples with Mixergy sometimes where he has to go back and say I'm sorry I've had to edit this out because I was pushing a point that didn't <trunc>ac</trunc> wasn't actually going to be factual</u>
<u n="176" who="S0262">yeah okay</u>
<u n="177" who="S0261">okay</u>
<u n="178" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="179" who="S0261">it explored something on the basis of of some erroneous research or whatever</u>
<u n="180" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="181" who="S0261">yeah so he has to make er that's errors and omissions</u>
<u n="182" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="183" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="185" who="S0261">but that's the way it works so it's fine</u>
<u n="186" who="S0262">but what's good about this is that where we can add more credibility particularly cos they're younger people and younger people might not be as believable as older people even though it's unfair to say is that if we use this idea of of connecting Monday to Tuesday and Tuesday to Wednesday Wednesday to Thursday the credibility is lent by the relationships so when we meet <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> on Monday we get to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> on Tuesday and then we get to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> on Wednesday the credibility is through the fact that they know each other and they can talk of each other about what they do</u>
<u n="187" who="S0261">and you get that with nearly every interview that you hear online that the people who are being interviewed and the people who are interviewing them have either met them in the past or they've met people that they know in common and that's hence how they are interviewing them</u>
<u n="188" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0261">it's not by chance</u>
<u n="190" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="191" who="S0261">so erm that demonstrates exactly your point</u>
<u n="192" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="193" who="S0261">most of the time</u>
<u n="194" who="S0262">right okay</u>
<u n="195" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0262">you hear them you know my friend or I know this guy or ah and have you heard of this yes I do buy that guy's product you know I do like this stuff you know so they find common points of interest</u>
<u n="197" who="S0262">okay <trunc>c</trunc> because our target group is younger what we're doing is we're breaking down the social relationships into manageable chunks so we are explicitly demonstrating how Monday connects to Tuesday Tuesday connects to Wednesday <pause dur="short"/> that's where they can learn <pause dur="short"/> is how Monday connects to Tuesday Tuesday connects to Wednesday so that</u>
<u n="198" who="S0261">how relationships connect</u>
<u n="199" who="S0262">yes</u>
<u n="200" who="S0261">and networks are built</u>
<u n="201" who="S0262">yes and how communication is the vehicle for that to happen <pause dur="short"/> how we communicate with each other <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and if</u>
<u n="202" who="S0261" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="203" who="S0262">it does involve a lot to do with courtesy politeness there's lots of things in there</u>
<u n="204" who="S0261"><trunc>ye</trunc> yes erm</u>
<u n="205" who="S0262">like sort of growing an awareness of business etiquette you know if you're nineteen you might be feeling like you're on top of the world but you need to be able to show a respect to your elders et cetera et <trunc>cet</trunc> you know rather than telling people that let them see it for themselves</u>
<u n="206" who="S0261">okay <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> so we we're thinking about something that's a bigger picture than just interviewing students you're talking about an <trunc>inter</trunc> an an interviewing people who who can provide a benefit for the students as a whole as a community</u>
<u n="207" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="208" who="S0261">erm and that can be people that are either internal to universities or external and work in business and can be good er</u>
<u n="209" who="S0262" trans="overlap">sorry</u>
<u n="210" who="S0261">role models et cetera et cetera</u>
<u n="211" who="S0262">yes absolutely</u>
<u n="212" who="S0261">yeah?</u>
<u n="213" who="S0262">mentors</u>
<u n="214" who="S0261">all of that stuff</u>
<u n="215" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="216" who="S0261">yeah so that <trunc>a</trunc> absolutely widens your scope of your er business focus</u>
<u n="217" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="218" who="S0261">erm and connects a lot better from our point of view as a business model to er other things</u>
<u n="219" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="long"/> so we're gonna have to roll we're gonna have to test this out <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="220" who="S0261">yeah just hold on a sec dude <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="221" who="S0262">okay so this is gonna be quite interesting because</u>
<u n="222" who="S0261"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> can you <trunc>g</trunc> just wait until you come through here and chat?</u>
<u n="223" who="S0262">because if we were to do a trial run of it and it did just happen by chance that students wanted to <pause dur="short"/> have me introduce erm interview say for example a member of staff in a university <pause dur="short"/> the student go yeah you know the reason I want you to really interview my mentor at or at the uni or my lecturer at the uni is because we <pause dur="short"/> share these common interests and er we you know think along along the same lines and I would say you know that's great so you know would you ask your lecturer to see if they'd be available for an interview and you'd go okay fine we'll see if it happens</u>
<u n="224" who="S0261">and that's great</u>
<u n="225" who="S0262">and you leave it just like that like a cliffhanger</u>
<u n="226" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="227" who="S0262">you've gotta leave it like that</u>
<u n="228" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="229" who="S0262">so the audience are looking at going I wonder if the lecturer will say yes I really hope the lecturer will say yes cos I wanna know what the lecturer's gonna say about the student</u>
<u n="230" who="S0261">and if you wanted to you could like wait a whole week or two weeks and you can thread of that story through each of your subsequent interviews <pause dur="short"/> whether it's er a little bit at the ends where erm I like the way the they're quite often structured there's er an introduction a storyline and then there are kind of things to learn at the end</u>
<u n="231" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="232" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="233" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="234" who="S0261">or references at the end</u>
<u n="235" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="236" who="S0261">and that's a time where you can provide that ongoing connection <pause dur="short"/> and say well you remember like last week when we were talking about this? well this is what's going on</u>
<u n="237" who="S0262">yeah recap recap</u>
<u n="238" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and this is where it's heading to</u>
<u n="239" who="S0262">recap</u>
<u n="240" who="S0261" trans="overlap">you can recap that</u>
<u n="241" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="242" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and you can provide a little <trunc>bi</trunc> little bits of information to maintain</u>
<u n="243" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="244" who="S0261">that thread of interest</u>
<u n="245" who="S0262">or something like</u>
<u n="246" who="S0261">you know</u>
<u n="247" who="S0262">well what would you do now if this was you? what would you be thinking of your next step? how would you be going about setting something up? and just always getting those kind of like out there kind of questions to people erm</u>
<u n="248" who="S0261">and it could be somebody is interested in how the heck did you become a <trunc>u</trunc> a lecturer and what's your background? I've read that on your profile and you've done this this and this erm and so how would I do this?</u>
<u n="249" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="250" who="S0261">how could I connect with people who are doing it?</u>
<u n="251" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="252" who="S0261">and <pause dur="short"/> I think a lot of the problem is this stuff is in the back of people's minds but they're too busy to actually take it along their journey from start to finish through university it becomes something that they focus their minds on at the end</u>
<u n="253" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="254" who="S0261">when <pause dur="short"/> mm it's sort of probably like my case you've stopped and you've gotta start something new rather than running a thread by the time you're building it</u>
<u n="255" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="256" who="S0261">so when you get to this point it's more than just grades it's gotta be more than just</u>
<u n="257" who="S0262">oh yeah</u>
<u n="258" who="S0261">getting getting top As</u>
<u n="259" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="260" who="S0261">and being accepted into something</u>
<u n="261" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="262" who="S0261">or being headhunted by a corporation it's providing yourself the best possible foundation on which you can jump out of education into the real world</u>
<u n="263" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="264" who="S0261">erm and there are many many examples of you know people who are gonna want to er get a good job work for a corporation work for a big place work for a small place work in community work on volunteer basis travel all sorts of different things</u>
<u n="265" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="266" who="S0261">threads er and this er they're gonna wanna start their own companies the the young guy there who was talking about you know I want to develop interstellar you know travel or whatever it is</u>
<u n="267" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="268" who="S0261">you know it's big picture thinking but it's a lot of psychology behind all of that</u>
<u n="269" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="270" who="S0261">and er that you're trying to run this thread which can take people from the start of university age they're learning from their peers that are above them</u>
<u n="271" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="272" who="S0261">and this is something I was taught when we were at school we used to have we <trunc>y</trunc>you would have peer supporters who could be people in the final year who were responsible for people who were starting</u>
<u n="273" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="274" who="S0261">school</u>
<u n="275" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="276" who="S0261">and to be their mentors</u>
<u n="277" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="278" who="S0261">and so you're creating this learn from each other experience which I think gets lost it does get lost because because universities are intrinsically erm segregated societies they are built of faculties er there's not much cross faculty interaction that even within the faculties quite often it wasn't uncommon for people who were doing masters or PhDs didn't even talk to any of the undergrads</u>
<u n="279" who="S0262">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="280" who="S0261">only when they had a job as tutor or a lecturer</u>
<u n="281" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="282" who="S0261">did they do so</u>
<u n="283" who="S0262">yeah not much has changed</u>
<u n="284" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and otherwise everybody was hiding in their corner</u>
<u n="285" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="286" who="S0261">and they were not sharing anything with anybody else</u>
<u n="287" who="S0262">no because in some disciplines you are not encouraged to</u>
<u n="288" who="S0261">well this becomes a it's a matter of managing competitive advantage</u>
<u n="289" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="290" who="S0261">and things like that</u>
<u n="291" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="292" who="S0261">however <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>th</trunc> you're talking about the brightest people in the world being hidden and locked in a corner or a cupboard for the benefit of something <pause dur="short"/> and they're not sharing any of their bright intelligent knowledge with anybody else</u>
<u n="293" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="294" who="S0261">and that has got to be</u>
<u n="295" who="S0262">a waste</u>
<u n="296" who="S0261">that's er such a waste</u>
<u n="297" who="S0262">yeah there's a lot of wastage</u>
<u n="298" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="299" who="S0262">in intellectual thought</u>
<u n="300" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and if if if you consider er a lot of the the kind of discussions that go on at universities and a in a public forum sense and predominantly around erm er <pause dur="short"/> orientation time or or er no erm intake time</u>
<u n="301" who="S0262" trans="overlap">can</u>
<u n="302" who="S0261">when you're trying to get students</u>
<u n="303" who="S0262">can you write that down?</u>
<u n="304" who="S0261">what I was saying?</u>
<u n="305" who="S0262" trans="overlap">cos I think that's a quite a a thought-provoking there's a lot of wastage in intellectual thought</u>
<u n="306" who="S0261">there is a lot of wastage</u>
<u n="307" who="S0262" trans="overlap">waste er waste</u>
<u n="308" who="S0261"><trunc>w</trunc> waste in</u>
<u n="309" who="S0262" trans="overlap">in intellectual thought</u>
<u n="310" who="S0261">intellectual thought</u>
<u n="311" who="S0262">that will get someone thinking what does that mean? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="312" who="S0261"><anon type="place"/> erm people <pause dur="short"/> are locked away not sharing <pause dur="short"/> with the er community <pause dur="short"/> within the university erm <pause dur="short"/> or otherwise now that's a perception whether that's true but that's just my experience from when I was at university that's what it felt like I might have been the type of student who chose not to engage with these people maybe they did engage with others but erm <pause dur="short"/> but I don't think so I don't think it was like that it was definitely an us and them type society</u>
<u n="313" who="S0262">oh yeah yeah yeah there is there is</u>
<u n="314" who="S0261" trans="overlap">er and that's the same kind of thing that you're brought up on through you start school and it's an us and them they are the old ones you're the you're the newcomers</u>
<u n="315" who="S0262">mm but</u>
<u n="316" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and then you go to university and it's the same thing and then you start in business and it's the same thing</u>
<u n="317" who="S0262">but everyone knows</u>
<u n="318" who="S0261">and</u>
<u n="319" who="S0262">the the this won't change if you get on with your form tutor as a pupil you'll do well</u>
<u n="320" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="321" who="S0262">if you get on with your lecturer at university or a lecturer you'll do well</u>
<u n="322" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="323" who="S0262">if you get on with your boss at work you'll do well</u>
<u n="324" who="S0261">and the reason why</u>
<u n="325" who="S0262" trans="overlap">but that doesn't change any time</u>
<u n="326" who="S0261" trans="overlap">er but <trunc>th</trunc> the that that is about building relationships and the reason why you'll do well is because you learn more because you're connected to these people</u>
<u n="327" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="328" who="S0261">and and I think quite often they're it's probably because by default they are a kind of mentor whether it's formally or informally</u>
<u n="329" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="330" who="S0261">erm and of course with a mentor you will learn things because there's somebody who's showing you the way</u>
<u n="331" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="332" who="S0261">so if you can create something that exists on a bit by bit basis which is erm using that ladder within the university to share knowledge from top to bottom I didn't last year and this is what it was like these are the things you could learn you know without it being a a a a mechanism to plagiarise stuff or whatever</u>
<u n="333" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="334" who="S0261">but it is about that of community people learning life skills which is learning and being a continuous learner and sharing their knowledge with others sharing is the important thing</u>
<u n="335" who="S0262">yeah yeah and I actually you know what there's so many mentor programmes at universities around the world</u>
<u n="336" who="S0261">they become diluted</u>
<u n="337" who="S0262">they're very diluted and they're not actually visible</u>
<u n="338" who="S0261">exactly</u>
<u n="339" who="S0262">they only have like award nights at the end of the semester where only a handful of bigwigs come down and it's all a bit tongue-in-cheek and it's a just a bit staged</u>
<u n="340" who="S0261">my example is er when I started the job here erm somebody er at the time was a proactive HR person who said everybody who wants a mentor put your hand up and I'll try and connect you with a mentor <pause dur="short"/> now she simply joined two people together by name who she knew but they didn't know each other</u>
<u n="341" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0261">erm and but not related in a context of a departmental</u>
<u n="343" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="344" who="S0261">context or anything like that now that could be a good thing or a bad thing</u>
<u n="345" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="346" who="S0261">however there was never any forum for you to actually meet together unless it was both of you doing it so all she was was a go-between</u>
<u n="347" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="348" who="S0261">she wasn't facilitating anything really</u>
<u n="349" who="S0262">mm I had that at <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="350" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="351" who="S0262">and I had a mentor I never met with them the whole time I was there</u>
<u n="352" who="S0261">and this is so you didn't have a mentor</u>
<u n="353" who="S0262">no I didn't</u>
<u n="354" who="S0261">so but and that's where the failure is in the whole thing</u>
<u n="355" who="S0262">but the reason why is cos it felt fake cos I'd been assigned someone</u>
<u n="356" who="S0261">and I have felt exactly the same thing</u>
<u n="357" who="S0262">I felt it better to find my own mentor</u>
<u n="358" who="S0261">mm and you may do that and some people may do that but some people don't have the confidence to do that so by providing a mechanism which is related to you are just a year ahead of me then that's a an easier relationship than you've already gone so far</u>
<u n="359" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="360" who="S0261">or you are the expert</u>
<u n="361" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="362" who="S0261">and I've got this massive gulf to cross over</u>
<u n="363" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="364" who="S0261">to meet you in the middle and you're still way ahead of me when I meet you in the middle</u>
<u n="365" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well actually you're right because</u>
<u n="366" who="S0261" trans="overlap">you know</u>
<u n="367" who="S0262">when you're probably</u>
<u n="368" who="S0261" trans="overlap">that's like breaking down er into a smaller problem</u>
<u n="369" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it it is it's breaking down the relationships into more explicit erm <pause dur="short"/> demonstrations of how it actually gets put together cos I think you <trunc>kn</trunc> when you're seventeen or eighteen you're ambitious no matter what and you probably want to know Richard Branson let's say yeah? you're eighteen and nineteen you love business you you just wanna meet him once in your life so you can have a conversation with him about business and then you've gotta figure out how to get to Richard Branson to have your conversation with him <pause dur="short"/> and the thing is is that wow if you only knew that a mentor who is a year above you has already made a connection with Virgin and that person and Virgin also has a connection to Richard Branson you can see that quite quickly if you wanted to you could try and make that kind of thing happen</u>
<u n="370" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and it fits in within the block of six</u>
<u n="371" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so you do need to see that people above you by one year or two years</u>
<u n="372" who="S0261">have the potential to</u>
<u n="373" who="S0262" trans="overlap">are also relevant mentors</u>
<u n="374" who="S0261">be very relevant yeah yeah</u>
<u n="375" who="S0262">it's not always looking for the person who is the director <pause dur="short"/> of a company who's gonna be or a manager you know I go oh I know somebody who works for KPMG <pause dur="short"/> well yeah so what? what how's that gonna help <pause dur="short"/> say other people for example? well it doesn't it only helps me <pause dur="short"/> but that's what we wanna sort of erm demystify is you think that your connections only help you but that's not true your connections actually <pause dur="short"/> can be put to good use</u>
<u n="376" who="S0261">well it can help a whole community</u>
<u n="377" who="S0262">yeah and that's another thing that we can explore is by unpacking those relationships people learn how relationships get put together they can start to form their own ideas of how to put their own relationships together and most importantly of all this is what we have to learn is how to maintain relationships <pause dur="short"/> cos that's the hardest part</u>
<u n="378" who="S0261">mm <pause dur="short"/> okay so erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>f</trunc> <trunc>fro</trunc> we've discussed quite a lot from <pause dur="short"/> and and I think we're we're exploring some interesting things there's no doubt about that <pause dur="short"/> we <pause dur="short"/> we we need to do some testing erm so and on Tuesday we've got the short filming thing with these students</u>
<u n="379" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="380" who="S0261">and that's just something for your work-related stuff but is it something that can have some kind of benefit to what we're doing or is it just something on the side something else?</u>
<u n="381" who="S0262">like what?</u>
<u n="382" who="S0261">I dunno I just just the topic of what is being filmed for you know does that actually interrelate with anything that we're thinking of?</u>
<u n="383" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> definitely because you know you could say to somebody <pause dur="short"/> erm okay you I'm asking you about academic integrity who are the people who have helped you to understand what academic integrity is? and then they might fire off a few people and then you'd say okay tell me a little bit more about that tell me a little bit more about these people tell me a little bit more about the relationship tell me a little bit more about that <pause dur="short"/> and then by the end of it you'd say okay <pause dur="short"/> this person we've been discussing erm would you ask them if they'd be available for an interview?</u>
<u n="384" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="385" who="S0262">yes or no</u>
<u n="386" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="387" who="S0262">and that's always the end</u>
<u n="388" who="S0261">mm mm</u>
<u n="389" who="S0262">and that's the story the story either goes somewhere or it doesn't it's just the way the story is being driven people will drive it forward</u>
<u n="390" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="391" who="S0262">and that's true because if <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> contacts his lecturer and says oh I've been talking to this person and they're interested in about academic integrity I explained to them how you've helped me which is always nice to hear and the lecturer goes yeah okay yes I guess I have helped you that's good okay well erm we'd like to learn a little bit more about academic integrity from your perspective would you be interested to be part of a video er part of an interview? and the lecturer goes yes or no <pause dur="short"/> and then the lecturer says yeah and then I get in contact and interview them and I ask them questions so the reason why we're here today is because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has recommended that we interview you because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> put forward these ideas and that's the recap <pause dur="short"/> and then you can say well you know how how have you learnt for example about how to either act with integrity or teach with integrity or whatever the case may be and then the the lecturer would talk a little bit and then you'd find out well who are the people who you've been connected to <pause dur="short"/>  who have helped you in this area? <pause dur="short"/> and you know the whole thing could go really really random <pause dur="short"/> it could be so random and that's the whole that's great about the story is that you just don't know where it's gonna go <pause dur="long"/> I mean one thing that we you know we've gotta say is that obviously we can't be interviewing children because</u>
<u n="392" who="S0261">what are you talking about <trunc>childr</trunc></u>
<u n="393" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="394" who="S0261">we're not we're not dealing with children</u>
<u n="395" who="S0262">no I know but it's gotta be it you know it's gotta be clear that you don't we don't interview children <pause dur="short"/> so nobody gets some any funny ideas</u>
<u n="396" who="S0261">okay erm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="397" who="S0262">but I think to get the story going it's a it's a much broader topic not just about academic integrity but you have to phrase the topic in a way that encourages people to ask others to be interviewed so I would probably refine that by saying something like erm <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="long"/> yeah something like you know integrity is something that's core to <pause dur="short"/> to the everything that we do everything that we say erm but but how do we actually really realise that? how do we demonstrate that how do we think about it how do we reflect upon it what what's going on when we're thinking about academic integrity and acting with integrity? oh sorry even academic integrity it could just be personal integrity or you don't even have to put an adjective in front of it you can just talk about integrity <pause dur="short"/> and then you'd have to link it to a problem so you could say for example these days lots of students are asking ghost writers to write their assignments for them <pause dur="short"/> and this is not only an issue for er integrity but it's also an issue for other stakeholders and what can we do to solve this problem? what sort of things are there that's <trunc>amena</trunc> available to us to solve these problems? and maybe one way of getting to solve the problem is having people talk more explicitly about what the problem is and then we can get some solutions going so that I would that's how I would start to frame out the theme</u>
<u n="398" who="S0261">yeah so that I mean that that is the the kind of the service that you're trying to provide for the community and solving some people some some particular problems that the community are telling you about</u>
<u n="399" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="400" who="S0261">erm so so that's that's it's interesting that erm <pause dur="short"/> can provide a I think a good forum for to helping to build a community in a proactive way <pause dur="short"/> erm and trying understand some problems and what <pause dur="short"/> what we need we'll need to explore is how to relate that community to some kind of business model that starts attracting some some money whether it's that to be in the community you have to subscribe to be a part of it or whether there are certain products that you're selling to the community or erm <pause dur="short"/> or resources <pause dur="short"/> it could be a totally a a an a whole side business that is connected to the community</u>
<u n="401" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="402" who="S0261" trans="overlap">through a thin line that you're just steering the community to that side of the business</u>
<u n="403" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="404" who="S0261">but that's really giving the attraction</u>
<u n="405" who="S0262">mm mm</u>
<u n="406" who="S0261">erm</u>
<u n="407" who="S0262" trans="overlap">I think what you do is once you've started to get a feeling for what</u>
<u n="408" who="S0261">the problems are</u>
<u n="409" who="S0262" trans="overlap">the problem are and the solutions you start to go and the background to the interviewees do you wanna co-create? <pause dur="short"/> do you wanna co-create something together and put it as a product and sell it</u>
<u n="410" who="S0261" trans="overlap">as a resource</u>
<u n="411" who="S0262" trans="overlap">through this website?</u>
<u n="412" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="413" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="414" who="S0261">yes that's quite possible erm and like with the <anon type="miscPersonalInfo"/> with the interview well it wasn't an it was a chat I did with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I said let's record it let's put it up on <trunc>f</trunc> to share with everybody else okay? so I asked <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> about it and he said yeah that's cool and then you guys could like if you do it like this then you could put it up as bonus content on the site</u>
<u n="415" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="416" who="S0261">and all we were thinking about was sharing a conversation we weren't trying to present any particular learnings from it</u>
<u n="417" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="418" who="S0261">but there is something valuable in there to learn about <pause dur="short"/> but immediately he was trying to attract our information which we would provide him for free into to provide more value to the community and to his product</u>
<u n="419" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="420" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="421" who="S0262">yeah of course</u>
<u n="422" who="S0261">so he he's he's cleverly allowing his community to build his own product for him</u>
<u n="423" who="S0262">yeah well my initial reaction is what I was asking you to do before you went off and did the other thing but it was to make</u>
<u n="424" who="S0261">what other thing?</u>
<u n="425" who="S0262">erm <unclear>Ula</unclear> is to do the case studies so <trunc>wh</trunc> the reason why a case study is useful is because case files studies normally involve erm characters they use usually involve a situation that needs some managing or if there's some kind of problem that's arisen the characters need to organise themselves that they can start to align or something or group themselves so that they can <pause dur="short"/> resource something or <pause dur="short"/> they've been given a task where they have to solve a problem so the case study is always pitching up with something that needs to be done and then you take this <pause dur="short"/>  characters in the story from Monday to Friday and then you say okay actually this has got enough meat on it to become a case story a case study do you wanna co-create a case study which has also got moving images in the case study? so the case study is not just a boring old text with some answers to some questions at the end the case study is a a real life case study where they have agreed to co-create and act and be in this in this case study so it's not imaginary it's real <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="426" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="427" who="S0262">and the reason why you would do that is because <pause dur="short"/> you <trunc>s</trunc> you believe in the case study enough because it's real <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's not made up and secondly you would do it because you could sell it and earn money from selling it <pause dur="short"/> to <pause dur="short"/> higher education institutions that can't keep up and can't keep adapting to the new themes that are coming through all the time and higher education institutions don't know how to make moving image case studies <pause dur="short"/> they wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> fucking know how to do one if it bloody well bit them on the arse so this is an innovative way of saying you know your textbooks and how boring they are? well you could show this case study in your tutorial which has already got some teaching materials connected to it and some learning materials connected to it and therefore you can even put this online you don't even need to show it in a <unclear>tute</unclear> you can put it in an actual unit of study and this is a way to engage your your learners so if you're learning about collaboration but you can't collaborate because you're physically not able to you're an online student and you you need to learn about it <pause dur="short"/> this is a moving images case study which is a real life example of collaboration and you pepper it around teaching materials and learning materials so that basically the instructor knows how to use it and the learner knows how to get the most out of it</u>
<u n="428" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="429" who="S0262">and you sell this at a premium</u>
<u n="430" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="431" who="S0262">because it's real</u>
<u n="432" who="S0261">who are you selling it to?</u>
<u n="433" who="S0262">higher education institutions</u>
<u n="434" who="S0261">right okay</u>
<u n="435" who="S0262">because their online content <pause dur="short"/> won't move as fast as this the narrative in the storytelling of the case study will never match anything that they're capable of doing themselves and I can tell you that for sure unless <anon type="miscPersonalInfo"/> the one with the <anon type="place"/> has got that entertainment content concept going <pause dur="short"/> the learning <trunc>o</trunc> the learning that comes from an entertaining <pause dur="short"/> and entertainment's hard cos it's so subjective <pause dur="short"/> so that's why a real lives case study is almost as good as watching a film <pause dur="short"/> but it's better because it's real and it's not a documentary <pause dur="long"/> cos the documentary comes from a different <pause dur="short"/> documentary filmmaking comes from a different perspective it will have <pause dur="short"/> most times it's got preconceived ideas of what the story's gonna be <pause dur="short"/> so like when you watch Louis Theroux for example the narrative has already been written before they've even <pause dur="short"/> gone to America to interview the people <pause dur="short"/> so that's not really fair <vocal desc="laugh"/> we're projecting it as real life but it's been written by</u>
<u n="436" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and it's not essentially scripted</u>
<u n="437" who="S0262" trans="overlap">a producer yeah</u>
<u n="438" who="S0261">yeah mm uh-mm cos</u>
<u n="439" who="S0262" trans="overlap">but this is different this is not me writing the script it's not you writing the script it's the people who have agreed to co-create a a moving images <pause dur="short"/> for want of a better word a moving <trunc>i</trunc> images case study that's based on a real life problem</u>
<u n="440" who="S0261">who who who's the creator sorry?</u>
<u n="441" who="S0262">the creators are the people who have been in Monday to <trunc>Th</trunc> to Thursday or Friday so say there's Monday is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> Tuesday is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> Wednesday's erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="442" who="S0261" trans="overlap">this is through the centre of your thread?</u>
<u n="443" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="444" who="S0261">and then they're and then you're creating a case study related to that interview process</u>
<u n="445" who="S0262">yeah but you edit it</u>
<u n="446" who="S0261" trans="overlap">that you've explored</u>
<u n="447" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you you edit it into a narrative at that point it's become <pause dur="short"/> here are the characters <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> thingy and thingy what do they do for a living? well they are chiropractors okay what's the problem? well the problem is that their profession is under fire okay what can they do about it? well what they can do about it is X Y and Z and normally the thing that they're doing is something connected to their relationships with people <pause dur="short"/> so for example <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> might know the head of this group he was talking about yesterday called Friends of Science or something Friends of Science director is not only the Friends of Science director but he is also one of the leading academics and chiropractors in whatever country</u>
<u n="448" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="449" who="S0262">you see how it can go wherever it goes?</u>
<u n="450" who="S0261">yes of course</u>
<u n="451" who="S0262">we just don't know but the point is is that once you start <pause dur="short"/> uncovering some connections and people like the way you uncover the connections then and they trust you and they're co-creators so when they choose to create the case study by co-authoring it and co-being in it then they get a cut from the sell <pause dur="short"/> they are getting some royalties from it <pause dur="long"/> so sort of like if you <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="452" who="S0261" trans="overlap">er if it works in a business model then fine</u>
<u n="453" who="S0262">well if it's using a music a music model you know you're gonna have people who are getting a lot of money from selling an album <pause dur="short"/> they're more than likely gonna be the producers <pause dur="short"/> and the the band will get a cut</u>
<u n="454" who="S0261">yeah well that that's a very old and stagnant and dying business model</u>
<u n="455" who="S0262">alright so how are bands afloat nowadays <pause dur="short"/> financially?</u>
<u n="456" who="S0261">erm <pause dur="short"/> er I <trunc>w</trunc> I think that bands are because they get a <trunc>l</trunc> a larger cut of the deal now it used to be they got no money they're just paid a a rate by a producer or a manager the manager got the pot yeah?</u>
<u n="457" who="S0262">alright</u>
<u n="458" who="S0261" trans="overlap">the difference is that it's being shared more but also there are less true musicians around and there's more tat which is being created by production companies or recording companies yeah?</u>
<u n="459" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="460" who="S0261">which is you know they do a short-term business-related Hollywood-style we invest this much we get this much out of it it lives and dies a short life</u>
<u n="461" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="462" who="S0261">you know?</u>
<u n="463" who="S0262" trans="overlap">okay well somewhere in there</u>
<u n="464" who="S0261">an example of getting around this is like Spotify or Netflix using subscription models okay? so they're providing people access to get around a music problem which was that they were making the content not getting money for it because it was getting pirated and the argument goes that because somebody is getting some money out of it that's better than getting no money out of it so it still gets pirated but more people pay a small amount to use it through a subscription model</u>
<u n="465" who="S0262">yeah alright well</u>
<u n="466" who="S0261" trans="overlap">it means that it's some <trunc>mo</trunc> some money okay</u>
<u n="467" who="S0262" trans="overlap">there's there's some somewhere between there and there and publishing there is a model for us to sell to higher education institutions</u>
<u n="468" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="469" who="S0262">there is a model because what you're providing is a high quality content which will engage with a student target group <pause dur="short"/> cos the the universities are going to have to get a lot cleverer at producing content to engage with certain age groups <pause dur="short"/>  they're really gonna have to get clever at that so if we are pitching in at the here is our our roundabout our age group of who we are able to attract on our websites and make these case studies with kids in them and adults</u>
<u n="470" who="S0261">professionals</u>
<u n="471" who="S0262">and professionals</u>
<u n="472" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="473" who="S0262">erm no not only are you going to be able to provide some learning to fill some stuff that's gonna be difficult for you to fill otherwise but certainly it's also giving you that warm touchy friendly feeling because everybody wants to say oh we are a lovely university and we are so friendly with our students and they love us <pause dur="short"/> so you're trying to warm warm up the bed so to speak by giving people this expectation that okay this case study may not come <anon type="place"/> university but the fact that you've putting it in your online course at <anon type="place"/> university by association means that students might expect that they can do something similar themselves they <trunc>cou</trunc> they too could go to a lecturer and say well you know what I've had this great idea how about we go for a coffee and have a chat about it? and the lecturer was like oh my god somebody's come and asked me to go and have a coffee with them and they're an undergrad student I don't even talk to undergrads the you know what I mean? so there's this kind of like you're selling on a a feeling you're not selling just a product you're selling a feeling of the product too like a warmth to it bringing in this idea of <pause dur="short"/> like Oxford and Cambridge where you used to go round for a cup of tea with your you know your personal tutor and your personal tutor would ask you all sorts of questions about your life and what you want to do with your life and give you biscuits that idea you know? friendly <pause dur="short"/> warm <pause dur="short"/> helpful <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> the good thing about it is is that what you're what you're proving to others is that it's sustainable cos what they're saying is <pause dur="short"/> you can come if you want to you can come to our website you can have a look and preview at some of our case studies <pause dur="short"/> if you want to make a case study with us about something we are happy to do that but it needs to be done in a formatted way meaning we need you to come and do Monday and then get a person to come and do Tuesday and then Wednesday and Thursday it's not just come and ring on our door on our door and say hey <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> have got this fantastic idea for a case study you're like great <pause dur="short"/> but it's a format that we have to put that into</u>
<u n="474" who="S0261">mm mm</u>
<u n="475" who="S0262">cos the one thing that you can you know and you should <trunc>obvious</trunc> obviously be aware of is that formats er are very powerful</u>
<u n="476" who="S0261">mm of course</u>
<u n="477" who="S0262">and they're also very rip er offable as well</u>
<u n="478" who="S0261">yes <pause dur="short"/> <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
