<u n="417" who="S0070"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> I don't kind of figure <pause dur="short"/> because I'm just the I know a guy who's who's married to a a Japanese woman <pause dur="short"/> and he says that he gets it a bit</u>

<u n="541" who="S0070">well <pause dur="short"/> perhaps so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> cos I was thinking about Italian this morning <pause dur="short"/> cos I was er Easter Monday we visited this Italian chap that we know <pause dur="short"/> and and I was listening to to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> gave his wife a er er a jacket <pause dur="short"/> and she said to her husband oh <unclear/> And I thought oh that's really you know we like this <unclear/> And I thought that's really odd isn't it <pause dur="short"/> because that such a kind of formulaic expression</u>
<u n="542" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="543" who="S0070">that you know you see it all the time in <trunc>se</trunc> and and I thought we</u>

<u n="546" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="547" who="S0070">and I wondered if er Italian's a bit like so when they answer the phone it's always er</u>

<u n="549" who="S0070"><unclear/></u>
<u n="550" who="S0180">yeah yeah cos in <trunc>J</trunc> in Japan you have certain what was it? Formal way of speaking</u>

<u n="557" who="S0070">no I'd say not <pause dur="short"/> we we tend to sort of I I don't know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> I mean er it it would be quite interesting wouldn't it to sort of have a look a bit more closer <pause dur="short"/> er I don't know enough about Korean or Italian to say so but you know <pause dur="short"/> there are kind of I would say they're a lot more fixed <unclear/></u>
<u n="558" who="S0180">there are <trunc>for</trunc> there it's formulaic in every language <pause dur="short"/> but it's more</u>

<u n="563" who="S0070">like when they're on</u>
<u n="564" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="565" who="S0070">italians on the telephone <pause dur="short"/> they'll often say sort of like when they want to <trunc>intro</trunc> like listen to like so it's <unclear/> listen to me <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>

<u n="595" who="S0070">or hi <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> listen you know and they seem to have that sort of introduction bit <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> so not just the greeting bit but the <trunc>whol</trunc> the whole next stage you know</u>
<u n="596" who="S0180">there still are things that are inappropriate though aren't there <pause dur="short"/> we wouldn't start saying like um you there</u>

<u n="598" who="S0180">to your boss <pause dur="short"/> you know you'd say oh  you'd say oh  excuse me</u>

<u n="600" who="S0180">or er <unclear/></u>
<u n="601" who="S0070">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm just surely because ner ner ner ner ner ner <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> sort of like wonder</u>
<u n="602" who="S0180">doesn't exist in English but it's different it's it's er</u>
<u n="603" who="S0070">yes</u>
<u n="604" who="S0180">you have to learn the convention don't you</u>
<u n="605" who="S0070">I think so</u>
<u n="606" who="S0180">for the language</u>
<u n="607" who="S0070">and I  and I  would say there's a lot I dunno  I dunno</u>
<u n="608" who="S0180">er the those people are probably</u>
<u n="609" who="S0070">I just just have a feeling</u>
<u n="610" who="S0180">probably translating their formal convention into English <pause dur="short"/> and it doesn't work</u>
<u n="611" who="S0070">right <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="612" who="S0180">so the Korean learner was trying to maybe in Korean you can learn some formulaic phrases <pause dur="short"/> and she was trying to replicate that</u>
<u n="613" who="S0070">perhaps so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="614" who="S0180">in English</u>
<u n="615" who="S0070">and that's what I mean</u>
<u n="616" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="617" who="S0070">perhaps in service transaction okay there are  there are  formed</u>
<u n="618" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="619" who="S0070">there is a <trunc>f</trunc> a er <trunc>f</trunc> a generic structure to a <trunc>for</trunc></u>
<u n="620" who="S0180">like can I help you? Yeah</u>
<u n="621" who="S0070">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but but maybe it is more formulaic in some languages than others <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="622" who="S0180">but also the student is not aware of how language works</u>
<u n="623" who="S0070">right</u>
<u n="624" who="S0180">no matter what background they're from <pause dur="short"/> cos you might have learners English speakers trying to do that in another language as well</u>
<u n="625" who="S0070">mm</u>
<u n="626" who="S0180">can you write down some sentences for me? And then they</u>
<u n="627" who="S0070">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="628" who="S0180">they get the same problem</u>
<u n="629" who="S0070">yeah</u>
<u n="630" who="S0180">so it might not be a problem with the language background of the person <pause dur="short"/> but it's the er the student's lack of awareness about how language works</u>
<u n="631" who="S0070">mm</u>
<u n="632" who="S0180">and that could be from any cultural background</u>
<u n="633" who="S0070">true</u>
<u n="634" who="S0180">you know</u>
<u n="635" who="S0070">and indeed it's also a a a mistake that coursebook writers make themselves</u>
<u n="636" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="637" who="S0070">and I was thinking today about about this you know how we we we give students a list of words or phrases and we say okay now I want you to put those into a dialogue</u>
<u n="638" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="639" who="S0070">forgetting that the dialogue is actually interactive <pause dur="short"/> and and what you say</u>
<u n="640" who="S0180">negotiated <pause dur="short"/> yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="641" who="S0070">what depends on what I say and depends and so we we might have these phrases but we're never gonna get them into the dialogue <pause dur="short"/> because our dialogue is is doing its own thing <pause dur="short"/> kind of thing</u>
<u n="642" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's right <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> informs doesn't it <pause dur="short"/> each part er informs the next part don't they</u>
<u n="643" who="S0070">Informs the next part</u>
<u n="644" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="645" who="S0070">yeah <pause dur="short"/> rather than okay hang on a minute we've gotta go back cos I've gotta use this expression here</u>
<u n="646" who="S0180"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> there are a lot of activities like that aren't there</u>

<u n="648" who="S0180"><unclear/></u>
<u n="649" who="S0070">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so you make you try and build a dialogue around these kind of words and phrases <pause dur="short"/> sort of like with the deduction thing <pause dur="short"/> it might be a</u>
<u n="650" who="S0180">but it's like the lesson sequencing isn't it <pause dur="short"/> it's like <trunc>we</trunc> well here's the language presentation now use it</u>
<u n="651" who="S0070">now use it <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="652" who="S0180">free practice <pause dur="short"/> controlled practice</u>
<u n="653" who="S0070">yeah</u>
<u n="654" who="S0180">and it is artificial in that way</u>
<u n="655" who="S0070">it is because the free practice isn't really that free <pause dur="short"/> cos you have the teacher standing over you and every time they say you know ah yesterday I go cinema <pause dur="short"/> brilliant <pause dur="short"/> yesterday I went cinema <pause dur="short"/> yeah I go cinema <pause dur="short"/> brilliant <pause dur="short"/> and you're like</u>

<u n="669" who="S0070">I don't think so <pause dur="short"/> and I no and I suppose there's been er probably a lot of research done on that <pause dur="short"/> but but that's the falling down of of that PPP sort of approach <pause dur="short"/> and its many</u>
<u n="670" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="671" who="S0070">manifestations is that you know okay er you can try it now to do practice and hope that they integrate those</u>

<u n="673" who="S0070">but to <trunc>m</trunc> to pass or fail someone on their teaching practice as to whether or not they use those forms is a bit unfair really <pause dur="short"/> unless you're gonna stand over them <pause dur="short"/> beat the beat them with a stick if they don't use them <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
