<u n="543" who="S0115">um</u>
<u n="544" who="S0037">they're horrible aren't they <pause dur="short"/> they smell really bad</u>
<u n="545" who="S0115">er they're they can be a bit sort of er like I think the um</u>
<u n="546" who="S0037">and I think when you go and see old people who are in hospital</u>
<u n="547" who="S0115"><trunc>d</trunc> it's a bit grim isn't it having to stay overnight I think</u>
<u n="548" who="S0037">it's just er a bit like when they're in  when they're in  like a ward with floods of like crazy other old people and that</u>
<u n="549" who="S0115"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="550" who="S0037">it's a bit much</u>
<u n="551" who="S0115">yeah I think er er I it it'd be hard to have to stay overnight and stuff <pause dur="short"/> I mean</u>
<u n="552" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="553" who="S0115">I suppose it's better if you  if you  have your own</u>
<u n="554" who="S0037">little room</u>
<u n="555" who="S0115">room or or something or er get</u>
<u n="556" who="S0037">private healthcare</u>
<u n="557" who="S0115">like you get your your</u>
<u n="558" who="S0037">but that thing about the TV that's just</u>
<u n="559" who="S0115">your family to live in <trunc>wi</trunc> you know get your your family to live <trunc>wi</trunc> to stay with you so that you're not on your own</u>
<u n="560" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="561" who="S0115">it's better</u>
<u n="562" who="S0037">I dunno if you can though</u>
<u n="563" who="S0115">I dunno <pause dur="short"/> it depends what you've got</u>
<u n="564" who="S0037">but that thing about like the TV <pause dur="short"/> you know like if you're in hospital  if you're in hospital  now you have to pay to watch the TV <pause dur="short"/> like how is that right?</u>
<u n="565" who="S0115">oh yeah the TV thing <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="566" who="S0037">that's so bad</u>
<u n="567" who="S0115">I hope that</u>
<u n="568" who="S0037">I still can't get over that like <pause dur="short"/> I think that's shocking</u>
<u n="569" who="S0115">well I think it's the price of it actually rather than the the act of paying that's</u>
<u n="570" who="S0037">it's the what sorry?</u>
<u n="571" who="S0115">the price <pause dur="short"/> it's it's <trunc>hi</trunc> it's er they they have a</u>
<u n="572" who="S0037">yeah but even if it was a pound a day I would still be like I think that would still be wrong</u>
<u n="573" who="S0115">I mean well yeah er er it would be better to have um</u>
<u n="574" who="S0037">Cos if you've paid for your TV licence like</u>
<u n="575" who="S0115">yeah like a  like a free yeah you should get maybe a <trunc>f</trunc> a couple of free channels like Freeview or something</u>
<u n="576" who="S0037">Cos if you</u>
<u n="577" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="578" who="S0037">if you're like a little old lady and you've paid</u>
<u n="579" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="580" who="S0037">you've paid for your TV licence</u>
<u n="581" who="S0115">all your life yeah</u>
<u n="582" who="S0037">but you can't watch it in your house because you're in hospital like <pause dur="short"/> it's not like you're doing anything <trunc>wr</trunc> naughty <pause dur="short"/> it's just that you're not in your own house to watch your own TV like <pause dur="short"/> I think it's really bad</u>
<u n="583" who="S0115">I mean er I I think that they should definitely give you some free channels for the  for the  yeah the  in the  in hospital</u>
<u n="584" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="585" who="S0115">er thing <pause dur="short"/> so they have they those those screens don't they so you can have internet and phone and um <pause dur="short"/> the way it just</u>
<u n="586" who="S0037">well maybe</u>
<u n="587" who="S0115">the way it works is obviously it's er outsourced to some companies <pause dur="short"/> um they</u>
<u n="588" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="589" who="S0115">I mean there's just</u>
<u n="590" who="S0037">but I think it just it's prejudice against the old people though</u>
<u n="591" who="S0115">it's it's you're putting it's not a  it's not a  competitive market at the moment at all cos you're just outsourcing the the beds</u>
<u n="592" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="593" who="S0115">er to one you know one hospital will outsource to one company therefore that's no competition there at all <pause dur="short"/> and then um</u>
<u n="594" who="S0037">but I think like it's just penalizing old people <pause dur="short"/> because like if we were in hospital</u>
<u n="595" who="S0115">yeah younger people as well wouldn't be so yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="596" who="S0037">you'd take your smartphone <pause dur="short"/> you'd have a laptop <pause dur="short"/> like some DVDs</u>
<u n="597" who="S0115">well I mean well they they did they were trying to stop that as well because you see the company has an incentive that it wants its own</u>
<u n="598" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="599" who="S0115">phone service and its own internet</u>
<u n="600" who="S0037">but surely it can't</u>
<u n="601" who="S0115">service to be used <pause dur="short"/> so it the company is gonna wanna try and er stop people from um</u>
<u n="602" who="S0037">I don't think you can though can you?</u>
<u n="603" who="S0115">I I think the way it's worked is that that people do want</u>
<u n="604" who="S0037"><unclear/> machines</u>
<u n="605" who="S0115">to have a screen <pause dur="short"/> people do want to have a screen but how it's ended up in that situation where you've got</u>
<u n="606" who="S0037">yeah it's stupid</u>
<u n="607" who="S0115">a company requiring a certain amount of profit for every hospital for those screens <pause dur="short"/> I I it it doesn't seem to have worked out like in in in the right way <pause dur="short"/> I I just think it er it should um there should be a way to get the free to get some free</u>
<u n="608" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="609" who="S0115">channels to er the mainly older people in the beds</u>
<u n="610" who="S0037">poorer people</u>
<u n="611" who="S0115">and er I I think um</u>
<u n="612" who="S0037">no it's pretty shocking</u>
<u n="613" who="S0115">you know you'd obviously if you've got to pay for the service if you've got to pay for the the</u>
<u n="614" who="S0037">yep</u>
<u n="615" who="S0115">screens but um</u>
<u n="616" who="S0037">I wonder what we'll be like when we're old people <pause dur="short"/> like there probably won't even like TV'll probably be beamed straight into your brain or something</u>
<u n="617" who="S0115">oh yeah well I mean <pause dur="short"/> well they used to have you just had  you just had  like one one TV didn't you in some place</u>
<u n="618" who="S0037">Cos I remember <trunc>s</trunc> I still remember having a TV</u>
<u n="619" who="S0115">that you share</u>
<u n="620" who="S0037">that was in like a big wooden box <pause dur="short"/> and you had to get up and like there was like four buttons and then like you could <trunc>p</trunc> change the channel by pressing those big square buttons <pause dur="short"/> and then if you pushed on it like a thing came out and it had like a little slidery dial thing</u>
<u n="621" who="S0115">yeah well</u>
<u n="622" who="S0037">do you remember those?</u>
<u n="623" who="S0115">well I've seen <trunc>su</trunc> I didn't have such a  such a  big one as</u>
<u n="624" who="S0037">well I was cutting edge me</u>
<u n="625" who="S0115">a big one as  that <pause dur="short"/> I mean I had like we had a black and white one that just had a single dial that that you turn</u>
<u n="626" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="627" who="S0115">I think</u>
<u n="628" who="S0037">like djoo like</u>
<u n="629" who="S0115">yeah so you actually had to find its position on the dial <pause dur="short"/> then yeah then I had like a colour one that and they had the buttons and you had to tune each button</u>
<u n="630" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's what I mean</u>
<u n="631" who="S0115">er</u>
<u n="632" who="S0037">but there was never a remote or anything</u>
<u n="633" who="S0115">oh yeah yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> er tuning so that's that's an advantage and then then you get to a remote which is er better still <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="634" who="S0037">but now they have all them</u>
<u n="635" who="S0115">now we've got digital so er you it sort of does itself <pause dur="short"/> which is better still <pause dur="short"/> so it's it's it's quite an improvement</u>
<u n="636" who="S0037">but I don't understand like so like that TV like it's still a big like square box TV but why would you just throw it out just to get a flat one? It just seems stupid</u>
<u n="637" who="S0115">er</u>
<u n="638" who="S0037">if that exploded I wouldn't buy necessarily another big square TV like that <pause dur="short"/> I would probably buy a flat one</u>
<u n="639" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="640" who="S0037">but I'm not gonna throw that out to buy a flat one</u>
<u n="641" who="S0115">no well I mean I think some people just like to have the latest technology don't they <pause dur="short"/> and er</u>
<u n="642" who="S0037">but there's nothing wrong with that TV</u>
<u n="643" who="S0115">I know <pause dur="short"/> well I think</u>
<u n="644" who="S0037">well actually <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="645" who="S0115">I think the majority of people would er it's alright actually er</u>
<u n="646" who="S0037">it does make like a brr sound if the volume's up too high</u>
<u n="647" who="S0115">I'm not sure that's it or one of the other machines actually</u>
<u n="648" who="S0037">do you think it's the digibox?</u>
<u n="649" who="S0115">I don't think it's the <trunc>f</trunc> the TV's fault but um you can always plug in another amplifier <pause dur="short"/> as we did um</u>
<u n="650" who="S0037">yeah till I snapped it</u>
<u n="651" who="S0115">till you broke the wire</u>
<u n="652" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="653" who="S0115">of that er</u>
<u n="654" who="S0037">oh well</u>
<u n="655" who="S0115">but we um</u>
<u n="656" who="S0037">I bet that's only like 1p that wire though</u>
<u n="657" who="S0115">yeah but I think most people would not throw something away unless it it was broken <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="658" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="659" who="S0115">well you normally  you normally  get a new flash TV you know a a a</u>
<u n="660" who="S0037">do you remember that pub?</u>
<u n="661" who="S0115">spectacular sort of massive flatscreen TV with a you know like a</u>
<u n="662" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="663" who="S0115">as big as a sofa size TV</u>
<u n="664" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="665" who="S0115">and then <trunc>s</trunc> install it like um</u>
<u n="666" who="S0037">I think</u>
<u n="667" who="S0115">and then you'd but you'd keep the other one the the fat old one as well <pause dur="short"/> you'd keep that</u>
<u n="668" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="669" who="S0115">put that in like the baby's room or something</u>
<u n="670" who="S0037">the bedroom <pause dur="short"/> but</u>

<u n="673" who="S0115">remote control and stuff</u>
<u n="674" who="S0037"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I think I'd quite like that like um surround sound <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if I'm that bothered about a new TV but I like the idea of like the you know when you have all the speakers in all different places in the room</u>

<u n="693" who="S0115">he brought  he brought  something</u>
<u n="694" who="S0037">special</u>
<u n="695" who="S0115">quite</u>
<u n="696" who="S0037">speakery thing</u>
<u n="697" who="S0115">yeah and he had it in his er bedroom or something but he er</u>
<u n="698" who="S0037">that's right</u>
<u n="699" who="S0115">he also had well he has a <trunc>i</trunc> he had a iPod <pause dur="short"/> no um</u>
<u n="700" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="701" who="S0115">the other one  the other one</u>
<u n="702" who="S0037">iPhone</u>
<u n="703" who="S0115">yeah <pause dur="short"/> he had a iPhone <pause dur="short"/> um and he'd got well he's</u>
<u n="704" who="S0037">I dunno</u>
<u n="705" who="S0115">he's their big  their big  present that he'd got was er their big tech present was the er it was um</u>
<u n="706" who="S0037">iPad</u>
<u n="707" who="S0115">it was a <trunc>pho</trunc> it was that camera <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="708" who="S0037">oh yeah</u>
<u n="709" who="S0115">it was that that</u>
<u n="710" who="S0037">fancy camera</u>
<u n="711" who="S0115">camera that takes loads of photos <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> in  in one  one of your clicks and then it</u>
<u n="712" who="S0037">oh yeah</u>
<u n="713" who="S0115">gives you the best <pause dur="short"/> so it will take for example five before you've clicked</u>
<u n="714" who="S0037">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="715" who="S0115">five after you've clicked <pause dur="short"/> and running at say er in one second it might take ten in ten per second or something like that</u>
<u n="716" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="717" who="S0115">and then find the best er</u>
<u n="718" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="719" who="S0115">you know the best</u>
<u n="720" who="S0037">Cos I saw that on</u>
<u n="721" who="S0115">best one and it'll give you  give you  a choice of the the best ones yeah</u>
<u n="722" who="S0037">Cos they do that on like wildlife photography don't they because like you know I saw it on</u>
<u n="723" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="724" who="S0037">was it Frozen Planet?</u>
<u n="725" who="S0115">yeah <pause dur="short"/> to <trunc>m</trunc></u>
<u n="726" who="S0037">what was the other one called?</u>
<u n="727" who="S0115">to make sure that you've captured like cos yeah</u>
<u n="728" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos</u>
<u n="729" who="S0115">yeah to <trunc>m</trunc> to make it like as if it's filming it er twenty-five frames a second or something you can then have twenty-five photos</u>
<u n="730" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="731" who="S0115">per second</u>
<u n="732" who="S0037">but I think that on on</u>
<u n="733" who="S0115">to choose from</u>
<u n="734" who="S0037">on Frozen Planet it was because like say if they were waiting for like a um tut a whale to like burst through the surface</u>
<u n="735" who="S0115">yeah you</u>
<u n="736" who="S0037">like you</u>
<u n="737" who="S0115">you can't guarantee that it clicks on time <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="738" who="S0037">by the time you've pressed it it like it it's already happened hasn't it <pause dur="short"/> so I think it records even before you've pressed the button <pause dur="short"/> which is pretty cool <pause dur="short"/> it's like quite space age</u>
<u n="739" who="S0115">er yeah yeah well it's <trunc>e</trunc> it's essentially filming it isn't it</u>
<u n="740" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="741" who="S0115">at twenty-five frames per second</u>
<u n="742" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="743" who="S0115">but then it it simply takes a <trunc>s</trunc> a section like</u>
<u n="744" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="745" who="S0115">one second or two seconds out of that film</u>
<u n="746" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="747" who="S0115">and uses that</u>
<u n="748" who="S0037">for the picture</u>
<u n="749" who="S0115">then restarts and and begins filming again <pause dur="short"/> and then er repeats itself like that <pause dur="short"/> so instead of taking one photo you're actually taking maybe twenty-five or fifty photos</u>
<u n="750" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="751" who="S0115">and then you can choose the best out of that <pause dur="short"/> and that's apparently quite a big breakthrough I think</u>
<u n="752" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="753" who="S0115">or something <pause dur="short"/> or quite a big step <pause dur="short"/> er I myself</u>
<u n="754" who="S0037">I wonder how it judges which one's the best like</u>
<u n="755" who="S0115">mm</u>
<u n="756" who="S0037">Cos I don't think it shows you every one does it <pause dur="short"/> cos how would you be able to judge? Cos there's just be like</u>
<u n="757" who="S0115">er</u>
<u n="758" who="S0037">especially if you were taking something that wasn't moving</u>
<u n="759" who="S0115">well it it has some automatic  it has some automatic  features <pause dur="short"/> I mean er you could imagine that for face recognition it would sort of</u>
<u n="760" who="S0037">yeah if your eyes were closed</u>
<u n="761" who="S0115">it'd be able to sort of</u>
<u n="762" who="S0037">oh I hate the pictures when like</u>
<u n="763" who="S0115">exclude them yeah</u>
<u n="764" who="S0037">you look really drunk cos your eyes are like half closed</u>
<u n="765" who="S0115"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="766" who="S0037">I'm glad if something can get rid of those</u>
<u n="767" who="S0115">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="768" who="S0037">I hate that kind of thing</u>
<u n="769" who="S0115">er you do <trunc>ge</trunc> that's probably one of the main reasons actually I think <pause dur="short"/> closed eyes and looking away I think you could get with like a face er recognition</u>
<u n="770" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="771" who="S0115">er software would be able to do that <pause dur="short"/> but er also I suppose moving <pause dur="short"/> er if you move like if you're taking twenty twenty-five frames a second</u>
<u n="772" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="773" who="S0115">you don't get the <trunc>s</trunc> you probably wouldn't get a smudge would you</u>
<u n="774" who="S0037">I don't think so</u>
<u n="775" who="S0115"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Not not that you'd have to be moving quite fast to get  to get  a smudge on er</u>
<u n="776" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="777" who="S0115">twenty-five frames a second <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="778" who="S0037">that face recognition stuff <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember who was telling me <pause dur="short"/> er no I can't remember <pause dur="short"/> about how the <trunc>fa</trunc> you know in airports</u>
<u n="779" who="S0115">yeah I've been I know airports yeah</u>
<u n="780" who="S0037"><vocal desc="laugh"/> well in airports like apparently they've tracked like people's movements and behaviour <pause dur="short"/> normal people like most people what they do</u>
<u n="781" who="S0115">you're back back onto er privacy here yeah</u>
<u n="782" who="S0037">um <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I dunno I just thought that</u>
<u n="783" who="S0115">when when you say that what do you mean track people's behaviour or?</u>
<u n="784" who="S0037">so if we go airport we might</u>
<u n="785" who="S0115">Cos that could mean  that could mean  like they know whether you've tied your shoelaces or</u>
<u n="786" who="S0037">but tying your shoelaces</u>
<u n="787" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="788" who="S0037">probably like so so say normally when you go through security you you would go and check see where your flight is <pause dur="short"/> what what gate maybe <pause dur="short"/> what do <trunc>y</trunc> it hasn't been</u>
<u n="789" who="S0115">yeah there's sort of a like</u>
<u n="790" who="S0037">called yet</u>
<u n="791" who="S0115">there's a bit of a</u>
<u n="792" who="S0037">then you might go to Boots</u>
<u n="793" who="S0115">procedure that you follow isn't there</u>
<u n="794" who="S0037">and get some a glass of water just to drink and</u>
<u n="795" who="S0115">yeah so do do they mean that they're they're not perhaps necessarily targeting individuals <pause dur="short"/> they're targeting like the crowd and it</u>
<u n="796" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="797" who="S0115">to see what people do</u>
<u n="798" who="S0037">but then  but then by  by modelling what people do so go to Boots then go and look in</u>
<u n="799" who="S0115">yeah sit in a cafe</u>
<u n="800" who="S0037">try some sunglasses on</u>
<u n="801" who="S0115">for five hours <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="802" who="S0037">go and have three pints of beer even though it's one in the morning <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> Or three in the morning or whatever</u>
<u n="803" who="S0115">that's one of the good things about er</u>
<u n="804" who="S0037">I know that's one of the good things like about airports</u>
<u n="805" who="S0115">about airports is that  is that  you can sort of break rules that normally you <trunc>f</trunc> you follow</u>
<u n="806" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="807" who="S0115">so</u>
<u n="808" who="S0037">rules don't apply <pause dur="short"/> but um anyway so they mapped like people's behaviour and then based on that they can see people who are acting strangely</u>
<u n="809" who="S0115">er <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> when you say er acting strangely did you just mean not doing what the</u>
<u n="810" who="S0037">what do</u>
<u n="811" who="S0115">the crowd is doing? Because</u>
<u n="812" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="813" who="S0115">but then I suppose obviously there's always like statistically a a sort of a long tail so to speak the the</u>
<u n="814" who="S0037">well yeah</u>
<u n="815" who="S0115">er the weird  the weird  um</u>
<u n="816" who="S0037">yeah but I don't think it's</u>
<u n="817" who="S0115">people who yeah</u>
<u n="818" who="S0037">I don't think it's decisive <pause dur="short"/> I I'm not saying like anybody who's not doing what everyone else is doing is gonna be rugby tackled to the ground by like security forces</u>
<u n="819" who="S0115">I I think there's certain things <pause dur="short"/> yeah like</u>
<u n="820" who="S0037">but I think it would flag them</u>
<u n="821" who="S0115">well they'll then start they'd start spying on on the weirdly</u>
<u n="822" who="S0037">mm</u>
<u n="823" who="S0115">behaviour people wouldn't they <pause dur="short"/> er I think there's obvious things like if I mean we've seen some of these custom programmes</u>
<u n="824" who="S0037">oh I love those <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="825" who="S0115">don't you like UK Border Force or something that get on</u>
<u n="826" who="S0037">in fact let's put some on <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="827" who="S0115">pick Pick TV <pause dur="short"/> tune into Pick TV or</u>
<u n="828" who="S0037">oh can't put um er Really <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="829" who="S0115">like er on um yeah Really <pause dur="short"/> and er UK Border Force for example um</u>
<u n="830" who="S0037">and er what's the er Australian one?</u>
<u n="831" who="S0115">there's something you see if you see footage of people who are doing something dodgy like generally I mean say they're smuggling I think there's a tendency to be er</u>
<u n="832" who="S0037">A bit tense</u>
<u n="833" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="834" who="S0115">er</u>
<u n="835" who="S0037"><unclear/> kind of</u>
<u n="836" who="S0115">I think there's also like if you are if I was smuggling something I think I would wanna act normal</u>
<u n="837" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="838" who="S0115">you know what I mean? But</u>
<u n="839" who="S0037">but</u>
<u n="840" who="S0115">you can't</u>
<u n="841" who="S0037">no</u>
<u n="842" who="S0115">always really act normal <pause dur="short"/> but you might try to act normal <pause dur="short"/> um so I don't know how like what what example like would you give of of someone giving away the fact that they're they've got like</u>
<u n="843" who="S0037">I don't know</u>
<u n="844" who="S0115">two kilograms of coke in their <trunc>p</trunc> stomach or something</u>
<u n="845" who="S0037">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> like I suppose you would  you would  be agitated wouldn't you <pause dur="short"/> you would be sweaty <pause dur="short"/> you would like be more like <trunc>frant</trunc> I would be er well I mean er I imagine I would be <vocal desc="laugh"/> like</u>
<u n="846" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="847" who="S0037">really tense <pause dur="short"/> but I'm sure being calm and being</u>
<u n="848" who="S0115">yeah I think you would <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="849" who="S0037">tense pretending to be calm er looks different</u>
<u n="850" who="S0115">yeah I mean but this is you'd probably be going on like</u>
<u n="851" who="S0037">like you know when you're <trunc>f</trunc></u>
<u n="852" who="S0115">really spying and like really like body language sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> I er</u>
<u n="853" who="S0037">yeah but I think that's what  that's what  it was</u>
<u n="854" who="S0115">is that what you meant?</u>
<u n="855" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="856" who="S0115">not actual</u>

<u n="863" who="S0037">um <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what that would come under <pause dur="short"/> some sort of computer science thing or</u>
<u n="864" who="S0115">the the sort of body language recognition or something?</u>
<u n="865" who="S0037">yeah like <trunc>fa</trunc> it's kinda like face recognition <pause dur="short"/> so I suppose like computer science</u>
<u n="866" who="S0115">yeah</u>
