<u n="629" who="S0192">it's like <pause dur="short"/> semitic one word it's like erm <pause dur="short"/> in the alphabet we have different erm graphemes which are the letters</u>

<u n="635" who="S0192">it can be a combination of letters but you make letters to represent <pause dur="short"/> how you say things in Chinese they don't do that</u>
<u n="636" who="S0228" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="637" who="S0192">it's logographic they have a <trunc>s</trunc> one image that represents a word so instead of having lots of symbols that represent a sound</u>
<u n="638" who="S0228">mm</u>
<u n="639" who="S0192">they have an image that represents a word and sometimes they can have extra lines that indicate pronunciation</u>

<u n="641" who="S0192">but in general it's er and that's logographic you then also got hieroglyphic which is more pictorial it's got like images that connect so <trunc>th</trunc>the image is actually somehow a drawing of</u>

<u n="654" who="S0228">yeah yeah yeah it's just cuneiform came up here somewhere cuneiform</u>
<u n="655" who="S0192">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> do you know what a diacritic is?</u>
<u n="656" who="S0228">no</u>
<u n="657" who="S0192">diacritic is any kind of <trunc>m</trunc>marker that indicates some phonological difference so for example when I told you if it's voiced or unvoiced you can have a symbol that will show you that</u>

<u n="685" who="S0192" trans="overlap">that's called aspiration it can either be aspirated or not aspirated so a diacritic would put a little H above it</u>

<u n="870" who="S0228" trans="overlap">yeah well</u>
<u n="871" who="S0192">you could write any language in this alphabet <pause dur="short"/> I don't know them all but I've studied all</u>

<u n="885" who="S0192">in <trunc>Kor</trunc> in English those two sounds are different they make two different words</u>
<u n="886" who="S0228" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="887" who="S0192">er pam and blam or whatever you know what I mean? but in Korean they're not they can use them interchangeably so instead of saying run they say lun or lice instead of rice because L and R</u>
<u n="888" who="S0228">yeah</u>
<u n="889" who="S0192">is not distinguished in their language</u>
<u n="890" who="S0228" trans="overlap">no I know</u>

<u n="892" who="S0228">it's probably why they <unclear/></u>
<u n="893" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it's <pause dur="short"/> it makes them terrible at speaking English because they don't see the difference my friends can't say Zachary Z in general they go Chachady Chacady like no Zachary Zachary Chacady</u>
<u n="894" who="S0228">why can't they say it though? just copy the sound?</u>
<u n="895" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I don't know we play screen golf and I erm <vocal desc="laugh"/> I typed his name in on the computer mine was <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is like people kind of like <unclear/> in like Japanese</u>

<u n="900" who="S0228">yeah</u>
<u n="901" who="S0192">it's terrible <pause dur="short"/> so I have to teach them these symbols so</u>
<u n="902" who="S0228" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="903" who="S0192">my <trunc>s</trunc> my students can read this alphabet</u>
<u n="904" who="S0228" trans="overlap">in Arabic they go <vocal desc="misc"/> a lot</u>
<u n="905" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="906" who="S0228">why is that?</u>
<u n="907" who="S0192">it's just the er sound in their language</u>
<u n="908" who="S0228">yeah but</u>
<u n="909" who="S0192" trans="overlap">there's no reason behind it</u>
<u n="910" who="S0228">yeah but</u>
<u n="911" who="S0192">they just use it to distinguish a word</u>
<u n="912" who="S0228">and that their language what spread over a lot of countries so</u>
<u n="913" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="914" who="S0228">so you'd think it will change <pause dur="short"/> drastically?</u>
<u n="915" who="S0192">it does change there's loads of different types of Arabic</u>
<u n="916" who="S0228">is there though?</u>
<u n="917" who="S0192">there are there's like every single <trunc>c</trunc> Egypt's got its own form of Arabic</u>
<u n="918" who="S0228" trans="overlap">but I read in a</u>
<u n="919" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it's a little bit different to to Arabic <unclear/></u>
<u n="920" who="S0228" trans="overlap">er yeah I suppose so I suppose it's regional isn't it?</u>
<u n="921" who="S0192">yeah it's like dialects</u>
<u n="922" who="S0228">but there is like a mother</u>
<u n="923" who="S0192">but that's the thing</u>
<u n="924" who="S0228" trans="overlap">a mother language I think <unclear/></u>
<u n="925" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I think <unclear/> arguing what is a different language there are no different languages <unclear/></u>
<u n="926" who="S0228" trans="overlap">cos I'm sure people speak different English</u>
<u n="927" who="S0192">there's just different dialects</u>
<u n="928" who="S0228">in different places</u>
<u n="929" who="S0192">would you agree with that? what I've just said?</u>
<u n="930" who="S0228" trans="overlap">you know what I mean? <pause dur="short"/> what's that?</u>
<u n="931" who="S0192">there are <trunc>n</trunc>not really there aren't really languages in the world there are just dialects</u>
<u n="932" who="S0228">mm yeah I'd say there are languages because I'd say <pause dur="short"/> some people can't produce some of the sounds that others can</u>
<u n="933" who="S0192">there're some quite interesting maps in here that show like</u>
<u n="934" who="S0228" trans="overlap">different <unclear>it is a</unclear> different language you trying to</u>
<u n="935" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but a dialect the whole</u>
<u n="936" who="S0228" trans="overlap">and different sounds</u>
<u n="937" who="S0192">what is the definition of a language?</u>
<u n="938" who="S0228">and and no need to <unclear/></u>
<u n="939" who="S0192" trans="overlap">how do you define if we're speaking the same language? can you give me a definition?</u>
<u n="940" who="S0228">cos I can say a word and you would understand it</u>
<u n="941" who="S0192">exactly that's perfect yeah it's called mutual intelligibility if you say something that I can understand then we're speaking the same language that is the only definition of language</u>
<u n="942" who="S0228" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="943" who="S0192">but there can be quite some pretty difficult dialects of a language where you don't really understand what's being said you know what I mean? you you understand most of it but like a lot of colloquialisms or thick Irish accents or thick Scottish accents</u>
<u n="944" who="S0228" trans="overlap">oh yeah mate the Scottish accent</u>
<u n="945" who="S0192" trans="overlap">they can be pretty difficult</u>
<u n="946" who="S0228" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="947" who="S0192">yeah but they're speaking the same language apparently but it's a different dialect now there's a map in here which shows a map of Europe and it's amazing I didn't realise that it quite went to this extent but you know you hear like <pause dur="short"/> oh you know Austrians can understand Germans but Germans can't understand Austrians and like the <unclear>Swiss</unclear> people they can understand like it's all like kinda bit like this and like</u>
<u n="948" who="S0228" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="949" who="S0192"><trunc>th</trunc>the Dutch kind of understand them but they don't understand them and you know I think</u>
<u n="950" who="S0228" trans="overlap">the <unclear/></u>
<u n="951" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it's the closest to the English language so if you what you can do on a map</u>
<u n="952" who="S0228" trans="overlap"><unclear/> like that</u>
<u n="953" who="S0192">it's pretty interesting <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you can trace a line across Europe</u>
<u n="954" who="S0228">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="955" who="S0192">you can trace a line across Europe</u>
<u n="956" who="S0228" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="957" who="S0192">and from this point to this point there'll never be a gap where this culture doesn't understand this there's mutual intelligibility moving along the line where the <trunc>ch</trunc> the dialect is simply changing</u>
<u n="958" who="S0228" trans="overlap">so I can understand a Frenchman so I you're saying if I don't speak another language but I met a Frenchman <pause dur="short"/> like I could sort of get on with <unclear/></u>
<u n="959" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no you'll follow a line where it's one way reciprocal like we can understand a bit of Frisian if we listen to it it's a bit weird</u>
<u n="960" who="S0228" trans="overlap">oh right so you're saying</u>
<u n="961" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but like but we can't understand French so it follows a line</u>
<u n="962" who="S0228" trans="overlap">a Frenchman might understand me</u>
<u n="963" who="S0192">but a Frenchman might understand a bit of Belgian Dutch or something like that</u>
<u n="964" who="S0228" trans="overlap">yeah well no apparently there's a place in Belgium cos you know you've got Frisia and all that and then there's Alsatia and they're all part of like France Belgium or whatever</u>
<u n="965" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="966" who="S0228">but they're actually like regional places</u>
<u n="967" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="968" who="S0228">quite important places <pause dur="short"/> they're erm <pause dur="short"/> where you can have the er <pause dur="short"/> three people from three different countries <pause dur="short"/> like sitting at a table one speaking Belgian one speaking French and another one cos you know you got local languages and they can all understand understand one another</u>
<u n="969" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah that's what I'm talking about</u>
<u n="970" who="S0228" trans="overlap">they speak a different language in northern <unclear>Siria</unclear></u>
<u n="971" who="S0192" trans="overlap">so effectively there aren't really any different languages <trunc>th</trunc>there is kind of the Indo European and the <unclear/></u>
<u n="972" who="S0228" trans="overlap">ah I think it depends how you grow up do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="973" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but effectively it's just dialects there's a famous quote <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="974" who="S0228" trans="overlap">oh yeah but if you grow up in a place where all these dialects were going on it would just seem like one language</u>
<u n="975" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="976" who="S0228">but you just got a lot of fucking different ways of pronouncing the same word</u>
<u n="977" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> actually there's a famous quote by someone about what a language is and it says a language is a dialect with an army and erm <unclear>funding</unclear> basically <vocal desc="laugh"/> like <trunc>dialec</trunc> languages are just simply really just borders now today there are countries that speak the same language like Hindi and Urdu is basically the same but they're from like Pakistan and sorry not Hindi and Urdu Urdu and <vocal desc="misc"/> ah what's that other one? Urdu and <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> ah you'd know it <pause dur="short"/> maybe it's Hindi and Urdu? <pause dur="short"/> I don't remember effectively it's the same language but because one country is Pakistan and one country is India they don't call it the same language one's Urdu and one is something else <pause dur="short"/> if we Google Urdu do you know what I'm talking about?</u>
<u n="978" who="S0228">do you know what I think?</u>
