<u n="599" who="S0483">what's this?</u>

<u n="606" who="S0482">you might be able to <pause dur="short"/> you probably can actually it probably reacts with the air and</u>
<u n="607" who="S0483" trans="overlap">well you can't you can't well <pause dur="short"/> whatever <pause dur="short"/> it's very small it's very small</u>
<u n="608" who="S0482" trans="overlap">you can with <pause dur="short"/> you <pause dur="short"/> okay fair enough but on a yacht that's the size of fire extinguisher you get</u>

<u n="615" who="S0483" trans="overlap">what <pause dur="short"/> no I think it's gonna be very helpful because you can just literally dip a little bucket over the side and put your fire out</u>
