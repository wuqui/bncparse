<u n="1" who="S0370">you were part of the Roman Catholic Church up until Henry the eighth</u>
<u n="2" who="S0012" trans="overlap"><unclear/> Henry the eighth yeah</u>
<u n="3" who="S0370">erm you know and some of the <trunc>c</trunc>crusades they did are not just against Muslims but against other Christians where they killed thousands</u>
<u n="4" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="5" who="S0370">it was horrendous absolutely horrendous</u>
<u n="6" who="S0012" trans="overlap">but all through all through life ever since Christianity began there has been wars and killings in the name of god</u>
<u n="7" who="S0370">but but there always have been</u>
<u n="8" who="S0012">and there always will be</u>
<u n="9" who="S0370">but not just Christian</u>
<u n="10" who="S0012">I mean you know it in Northern Ireland</u>
<u n="11" who="S0370">well no you have to be er <trunc>s</trunc> you have to be slightly careful about Ireland because</u>
<u n="12" who="S0278" trans="overlap"><unclear/> sectarian <unclear/></u>
<u n="13" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0370">it is sectarian but the easy way to define them is by religion because the Irish are Catholics and er those that were <trunc>s</trunc>settlemented within the pale were all Protestants</u>
<u n="15" who="S0012" trans="overlap">Protestants yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0370">hence the the labelling it's the easiest way to to to label people</u>
<u n="17" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0370">yeah er so <trunc>i</trunc><trunc>i</trunc>it is sectarian it's not religious</u>
<u n="19" who="S0012">but how many er why why do we label people?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0370">well because it's an easy way to categorise people you can tell which church they go to</u>
<u n="21" who="S0012">and then you you you have a conflict</u>
<u n="22" who="S0370">yeah yeah but there there have always been conflicts I mean I <trunc>d</trunc>I <trunc>d</trunc>I don't think you can you can say that yes things have been done in the name of Christianity in the <trunc>n</trunc>name of Allah</u>
<u n="23" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="24" who="S0370">erm but statistics show that roughly twenty percent of the world has always been at war it's never changed</u>
<u n="25" who="S0012">always</u>
<u n="26" who="S0370">never got it's varied slightly but you know</u>
<u n="27" who="S0012">somewhere in in the Bible it says there'll be a war every twenty-five years but there's been a war non-stop somewhere in the world</u>
<u n="28" who="S0370">well we're one of the worst countries</u>
<u n="29" who="S0012">we are we always have been</u>
<u n="30" who="S0370" trans="overlap">we're almost permanently at war</u>
<u n="31" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0370">we like to have our finger in the pie somewhere</u>
<u n="33" who="S0012" trans="overlap">and we're still at war <unclear/></u>
<u n="34" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">we are</u>
<u n="35" who="S0370">in we are in we're in Afghanistan aren't we?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0012">yeah and not only Afghanistan Rwanda we're we're in we're in</u>
<u n="37" who="S0370" trans="overlap">not in <trunc>Rwan</trunc> now</u>
<u n="38" who="S0012">well we come out</u>
<u n="39" who="S0370">I mean at the moment we're in Afghanistan</u>
<u n="40" who="S0012" trans="overlap">in Afghanistan yeah but we've been all over Africa like the Dutch <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0370">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="43" who="S0370">and the French and the Germans</u>
<u n="44" who="S0012">and the French and the Germans and <vocal desc="laugh"/> and everybody else</u>
<u n="45" who="S0370">we're just the Europeans who were the settlers weren't they?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0370">you know they they they were the ones taking over <unclear/></u>
<u n="48" who="S0012">now is it true that there are er only two families? one from Africa and one from Europe this is this is a a</u>
<u n="49" who="S0370">well</u>
<u n="50" who="S0013" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="51" who="S0370">but er I <trunc>th</trunc>I think probably the the strongest theory is that er if you take Adam and Eve</u>
<u n="52" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0370">not the Christian story just</u>
<u n="54" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="55" who="S0370">you know the first man and woman</u>
<u n="56" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0370">they were African</u>
<u n="58" who="S0012">they had to be <unclear>from</unclear></u>
<u n="59" who="S0370">right and er <trunc>wh</trunc>whiteness erm er was a a throw-off genetic throw-off or genetic variation and the people when the ice age came and people had to move further out</u>
<u n="60" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0370">if you were white you could survive in colder climates because if you're black you radiate heat more</u>
<u n="62" who="S0012" trans="overlap">it's true yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0370">if you're white you don't radiate as much heat you're able to survive in colder climates that's why the black people are near the equator right? and er er it seems to indicate the genetic er theories that they've got that black was the original</u>
<u n="64" who="S0012">the original colour</u>
<u n="65" who="S0370">colour yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">not white</u>
<u n="68" who="S0278">how do you say <trunc>radiate</trunc> black radiates more heat when actually black absorbs more heat</u>
<u n="69" who="S0012">it does yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0370">it does both</u>
<u n="71" who="S0278">so so it's more uncomfortable to be that colour in the heat <unclear/></u>
<u n="72" who="S0370" trans="overlap">it <unclear>transmats</unclear> <trunc>i</trunc>if <trunc>n</trunc>no no no er if you're in a hot country</u>
<u n="73" who="S0278">mm</u>
<u n="74" who="S0370">if you're black and you're sat in the shade</u>
<u n="75" who="S0278">mm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0370">you cool better than a white person</u>
<u n="77" who="S0278">oh okay yes I see</u>
<u n="78" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0370">cos you radiate heat more</u>
<u n="80" who="S0278">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0370">right? but if you're in a cold environment</u>
<u n="82" who="S0278">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0370">you're radiating more body heat than a white person is</u>
<u n="84" who="S0278">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0370">so white people are <trunc>c</trunc>capable of surviving in colder climates</u>
<u n="86" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0370">hence as as people got pushed out from the more populated areas or this is my area for my tribe you mate get out this is my space</u>
<u n="89" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0370">territorial erm the ones that got pushed into the cold areas the ones that survived the were the ones with the paler skin</u>
<u n="91" who="S0012" trans="overlap">this er</u>
<u n="92" who="S0370">so you get the genetic modification</u>
<u n="93" who="S0012">I I I I think Chinese totally different race and the er</u>
<u n="94" who="S0370" trans="overlap">well they say not you see they say</u>
<u n="95" who="S0012" trans="overlap">then the Inuit's went up into</u>
<u n="96" who="S0370" trans="overlap">well the Inuit's look very Chinese</u>
<u n="97" who="S0012">they are Chinese aren't they? yes and and this is the Inuit's came from China</u>
<u n="98" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low"><unclear/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0278">that's before the Straits were broken <trunc>th</trunc>they would've walked across from <unclear/></u>
<u n="100" who="S0370" trans="overlap">look</u>
<u n="101" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0370">look at the variations of dogs we've got from north</u>
<u n="103" who="S0012" trans="overlap">we'll that's true yeah but that's only because we interbreed em ain't it that's that's er</u>
<u n="104" who="S0370" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0012">human intervention</u>
<u n="106" who="S0370">yes but this this is as people move the the group that went over towards China</u>
<u n="107" who="S0012" trans="overlap">that's true yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0370">had the genetic makeup</u>
<u n="109" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0370">that meant that they they developed in one way so <trunc>a</trunc>and and er <trunc>g</trunc> <trunc>g</trunc> they don't call it Gondwanaland any more but originally they called it Gondwanaland when all the continents were one lump</u>
<u n="111" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0370">and they believed that this is because the other lump of the crust was torn off and formed the moon when the earth was in early development you see it got ripped off</u>
<u n="113" who="S0012" trans="overlap">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0370">so you had a big chunk of crust and the rest was water and over time it's tried to balance itself up</u>
<u n="115" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0370">so it's moved apart and so bits that moved there when it separated they then began to genetically develop independently</u>
<u n="117" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="118" who="S0370">and so you know traits that they have so that's why I mean we <trunc>d</trunc>we don't have inbreeding do we? you're not allowed to to marry anybody closer than a cousin</u>
<u n="119" who="S0012">well that's true yeah or you weren't</u>
<u n="120" who="S0370" trans="overlap">because the genetic material</u>
<u n="121" who="S0012">unless you lived in Norfolk</u>
<u n="122" who="S0370">unless you live in Norfolk of course yeah</u>
<u n="123" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="124" who="S0370">erm but you get that's why <unclear/></u>
<u n="125" who="S0013" trans="overlap">there was no no real no law at the best time <unclear/> you just <unclear/></u>
<u n="126" who="S0012" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="127" who="S0370" trans="overlap">well they argue this is why they have certain genetic problems down in Cornwall because</u>
<u n="128" who="S0013">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="129" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low"><unclear/></u>
<u n="130" who="S0370">they've a small isolated populations and there was inbreeding</u>
<u n="131" who="S0012">if there is no transport as we know it today</u>
<u n="132" who="S0370">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0012">what are you going to do in a village?</u>
<u n="134" who="S0013" trans="overlap"><unclear>there is only</unclear> yourselves isn't it?</u>
<u n="135" who="S0012">I mean a village becomes a village when there's so many people but there's so many people interbreeding with their other with cousins</u>
<u n="136" who="S0370">yeah mm mm mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0012">aunts and uncles they didn't know <unclear/></u>
<u n="139" who="S0370" trans="overlap">and if you get too much of it then you get certain traits you might get good traits you might get bad traits</u>
<u n="140" who="S0012" trans="overlap">your bad traits yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0370">you tend to notice the bad ones more don't you?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0012">you do yeah yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0370">yeah yeah but er erm the Chinese er the black hair for instance and it's not just Chinese it's Japanese as well</u>
<u n="144" who="S0012" trans="overlap">it's Japanese as well yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0370">dominant gene</u>
<u n="146" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0370">so er if you marry a Chinese person or a Japanese person your children will have black hair</u>
<u n="148" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0370">predominant</u>
<u n="150" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0370">the likelihood of <trunc>r</trunc><trunc>r</trunc>red hair or fair hair coming through is practically zilch</u>
<u n="152" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0370"><unclear/> just gets <unclear/></u>
<u n="154" who="S0012" trans="overlap">so where did red hair come from?</u>
<u n="155" who="S0013"><unclear/></u>
<u n="156" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">mm?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0013">where where did any of the families come from?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0012">yeah well</u>
<u n="159" who="S0370" trans="overlap">where does what?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0012">red hair come from</u>
<u n="161" who="S0370">it a <trunc>g</trunc> it's a genetic throw-off isn't it?</u>
<u n="162" who="S0012">it's a genetic</u>
<u n="163" who="S0370" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0012">but they call them Irish don't they?</u>
<u n="165" who="S0370">well the probably the group of people that moved into the British <trunc>Isle</trunc> <trunc>Bri</trunc> the first group of people tribe that went into the British Isles had red hair</u>
<u n="166" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0370">because the er north west Scotland and north west Ireland the furthest extremes of the British Isles</u>
<u n="168" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low"><unclear>so then when</unclear></u>
<u n="169" who="S0370">are where you've got the redheads</u>
<u n="170" who="S0012">yeah but</u>
<u n="171" who="S0370" trans="overlap">that's where the vast majority of redhead people are</u>
<u n="172" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0012">but I thought</u>
<u n="174" who="S0370" trans="overlap">and then the you've got the druids haven't you?</u>
<u n="175" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">you have yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0370">with black hair then you've got the Saxons</u>
<u n="177" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0370">right? and then you've got the Romans which are very <trunc>mu</trunc> Romans were the first sort of real multicultural group weren't they?</u>
<u n="179" who="S0012">they were yeah but Scotland weren't anything to do with England or the British Isles at one time Scotland was out here Britain was here and Scotland just joined it you have you have the actual</u>
<u n="180" who="S0278">it's where Loch Ness is <unclear/></u>
<u n="181" who="S0370" trans="overlap">I thought that split is where it's moving away not</u>
<u n="182" who="S0370" trans="overlap">no that's where it joined</u>
<u n="183" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah I thought it was I thought it was moving</u>
<u n="184" who="S0012">that's where we joined I'm sure it sure it's where we joined</u>
<u n="185" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0370">not that I was aware of I thought it was</u>
<u n="187" who="S0278" trans="overlap">I thought it was moving away cos it's too precise</u>
<u n="188" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low"><unclear/></u>
<u n="189" who="S0370">it's a rift valley</u>
<u n="190" who="S0012">yeah it's a rift valley</u>
<u n="191" who="S0278" trans="overlap">that's <trunc>th</trunc>that is so precise</u>
<u n="192" who="S0370" trans="overlap">but a rift valley is pulling rifting pulling apart</u>
<u n="193" who="S0278"><unclear/> <vocal desc="cough"/> mm</u>
<u n="194" who="S0012">but it's not moving away now</u>
<u n="195" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0370">it probably is</u>
<u n="197" who="S0278" trans="overlap"><unclear>I don't see</unclear> you could've got two land masses to join together with such precision</u>
<u n="198" who="S0370" trans="overlap">it probably is moving away</u>
<u n="199" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="200" who="S0278">as it is it's just gently moving away so it's it's precisely it's almost the same equidistant apart all the way through isn't it?</u>
<u n="201" who="S0370">I mean certainly</u>
<u n="202" who="S0278" trans="overlap">not a lot of difference there</u>
<u n="203" who="S0370">yeah the Irish Sea was erm was marshland</u>
<u n="204" who="S0012">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="205" who="S0370">and you could move between the two</u>

<u n="1636" who="S0370">oh for doing table lamps? yeah</u>
<u n="1637" who="S0012">table lamps yeah</u>
<u n="1638" who="S0370">mm</u>
<u n="1639" who="S0012">mm so</u>
<u n="1640" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1641" who="S0012">yeah it's <unclear/></u>
<u n="1642" who="S0370" trans="overlap">I was looking at erm er jigs that people have made up for erm copy router lathes</u>
<u n="1643" who="S0012">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="1644" who="S0370">it's where you mount the router on er a ninety degree arm</u>
<u n="1645" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1646" who="S0370">because a ninety degree arm you you you're going back on the template there</u>
<u n="1647" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1648" who="S0370">and it's the same distance away are you with me? so</u>
<u n="1649" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1650" who="S0370">cos if you have it on the same arm you get the differential in the amount it moves so you had to have a smaller template</u>
<u n="1651" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="1652" who="S0370"><unclear/> for it to work</u>
<u n="1653" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="1654" who="S0370">whereas the ninety-one works quite <unclear>likely</unclear> it tucks itself underneath the lathe</u>
<u n="1655" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1656" who="S0370"><unclear>you know</unclear> and you mount a a router in it so rather than using er a turning chisel turning tool you use the router <trunc>s</trunc> cos the router's whizzing round right? and you can you can reproduce things the same</u>
<u n="1657" who="S0012">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1658" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="1659" who="S0370">size every time</u>
<u n="1660" who="S0012">oh that's brilliant ain't it?</u>
<u n="1661" who="S0370">right? and then if you <trunc>i</trunc><trunc>i</trunc><trunc>i</trunc><trunc>i</trunc>if the finish isn't good enough though I've seen them on Youtube being used and it doesn't seem that bad</u>
<u n="1662" who="S0013">no</u>
<u n="1663" who="S0370">but you can always make it slightly bigger the template can't you?</u>
<u n="1664" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1665" who="S0370">and then just</u>
<u n="1666" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1667" who="S0370">just turn the last bit down yourself</u>
<u n="1668" who="S0012">I didn't know whether to buy router router table as well he's he's he's made a table with his router on that you can just go <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
