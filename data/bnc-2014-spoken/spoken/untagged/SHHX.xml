<u n="1" who="S0679"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I had a look at your two orchid plants in the erm in I suppose what you'd call your pantry isn't it?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0680">my under stairs in the kitchen</u>
<u n="3" who="S0679">yeah yeah erm neither look in the best of health <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>ha</trunc> did one of them get a bit cold in the winter?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0680">well they were over at <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s house <pause dur="short"/> erm so they were in a <pause dur="short"/> a really a mainly sort of unheated kitchen and they were quite near the window</u>
<u n="5" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="6" who="S0680">but I did pull them back and put them down on the draining board so they weren't fully next to the window and erm I think they did get a bit cold cos as you can see one of the leaves has gone a bit funny in the middle <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="7" who="S0679">yeah I've got a problem like that with one of my leaves and I know exactly how it happened it was in the bathroom and it put its leaf well its leaf went against the window and it was a bit condensated I think it didn't exactly freeze on the window but I think it got very cold in the end of the leaf</u>
<u n="8" who="S0680">mm</u>
<u n="9" who="S0679">and then I turned it round to try and help it and I think it may have inadvertently stuck its other leaf don't know quite what happened to the other leaf but something happened to it I reckon because it's got a similar mark on it like it's in the <trunc>m</trunc> in the middle of the leaf like on yours</u>
<u n="10" who="S0680">yes <pause dur="short"/> well mine my leaves wouldn't have been touching anything cold</u>
<u n="11" who="S0679">no but it would been jolly chilly in there wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0680">yes but I mean it didn't touch against anything</u>
<u n="13" who="S0679">no no</u>
<u n="14" who="S0680" trans="overlap">so it's not the end so</u>
<u n="15" who="S0679" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="16" who="S0680">it must be mine must be the cold atmosphere because</u>
<u n="17" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0680">er it's in you couldn't possibly have it touching anything</u>
<u n="19" who="S0679">the roots look</u>
<u n="20" who="S0680" trans="overlap">for that</u>
<u n="21" who="S0679">okay on that one though</u>
<u n="22" who="S0680">yes</u>
<u n="23" who="S0679">so if it probably could do with upping the watering a bit and give it a nice biggish drink and then see by tomorrow how much it actually wants then you may have to</u>
<u n="24" who="S0680" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0679">if er then you <trunc>cou</trunc> you know could discard the water out</u>
<u n="26" who="S0680">well I have been giving it half a cup er well half of that little container while it's been resting <pause dur="short"/> erm because it was still in well it was sort of resting I I ended up cutting off the long flower stalk but the flowers were on it for ages and ages</u>
<u n="27" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="28" who="S0680">in fact its flowers were still on when it shouldn't have had flowers <pause dur="short"/> erm so it may just be confused</u>
<u n="29" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0680">I don't know but I put it in that under cupboard because there's a window in there and it's er although it's south-facing it gets shaded by that er a bit shaded by that shrub outside and I don't really have any erm being a terraced house I either have north or south I don't have any <pause dur="short"/> east or west was it east the chap we saw?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0679">I don't know but at at erm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0680">it was a side wasn't it that I don't have?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0679" trans="overlap">in the bathroom where I keep mine that's</u>
<u n="34" who="S0680" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0679">west actually</u>
<u n="36" who="S0680">oh it might be west but that man we erm had a er went to the talk from</u>
<u n="37" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm mm mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0680">he was saying <pause dur="short"/> he thought preferably the type of windowsills I don't have available</u>
<u n="39" who="S0679">mm mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0680">well at least you're not in a back-to-back that'd give</u>
<u n="41" who="S0679" trans="overlap">no that would give you fewer options</u>
<u n="42" who="S0680">even fewer options but erm I wouldn't necessarily have bought one of those myself but as they were bought for me</u>
<u n="43" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0680">erm you know can't really say I oh I can't have one of those I don't have the right window for it</u>
<u n="45" who="S0679">especially the one that erm er lived in your neighbour's house for a while before he remembered to give it to you</u>
<u n="46" who="S0680">oh yes that's may not have helped helped its early progress</u>
<u n="47" who="S0679">erm I think there's a problem with the two that erm well it was three and it's now two that er we were given at the botanic gardens last year</u>
<u n="48" who="S0680">yes</u>
<u n="49" who="S0679">they look awfully sickly and they've got some really dodgy brown marks on the leaves which I don't think are intended</u>
<u n="50" who="S0680">no</u>
<u n="51" who="S0679"><vocal desc="cough"/> excuse me</u>
<u n="52" who="S0680">yes well well those er my two one of them seems to have a little leaf starting to grow</u>
<u n="53" who="S0679">that's a good sign</u>
<u n="54" who="S0680">in the middle but it looks a bit well it doesn't look like it's dried but it is a much darker colour but that that's maybe how they are but the other one is er only got a dried bit in the middle really it hasn't sort of brought up a new shoot</u>
<u n="55" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0680">so er it's got some new roots cos I thought the knobbly things might turn into something else but they they're roots</u>
<u n="57" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0680">so I'm not quite sure <pause dur="short"/> about those we'll have to er see how they get on really</u>
<u n="59" who="S0679">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0680">mm I have got some little cuttings in the bathroom of a well there's an aluminium plant <pause dur="short"/> erm in some water er</u>
<u n="61" who="S0679" trans="overlap">they seem far less common than they used to be</u>
<u n="62" who="S0680">no you can't get that so I was trying to keep that one on because it is <pause dur="short"/> I I ought to cut the tops off and do them again because they're getting very tall and thin but I'm worried about losing them completely cos I haven't really seen any about</u>
<u n="63" who="S0679">no</u>
<u n="64" who="S0680">er so and they do seem to like being in water so that's why I've left them like that erm and next to it in another little pot there's some Philodendron I believe it is sweetheart <pause dur="short"/> vine plant which erm has heart-shaped leaves for its name and that likes being in water so I've left those cuttings in water for quite a time and I noticed the other day <pause dur="short"/> that it's very cheeky one of them erm has put out a a shoot which they do and they <trunc>ca</trunc> you can root from those shoots and it's stretched across and stuck its new roots in the other one's water</u>
<u n="65" who="S0679">ah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0680">so they're like in a chain which reminded me of your orchid</u>
<u n="67" who="S0679">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0680" trans="overlap">that was in the next pot to another orchid in your bathroom and it and it put its roots in its neighbour's pot</u>
<u n="69" who="S0679">and that might be the same one that er put its root on your flannel</u>
<u n="70" who="S0680" trans="overlap">oh yes and that's right cos I'd forgotten that yes cos when I was there and the flannel was hanging on the hook a little further down it it seemed to be progressing its root and its root was resting on my flannel</u>
<u n="71" who="S0679">yes</u>
<u n="72" who="S0680">so er</u>
<u n="73" who="S0679" trans="overlap">very <unclear/></u>
<u n="74" who="S0680">it's a different way of getting your flannel dry having an orchid drink the water off it but er</u>
<u n="75" who="S0679">you know the spiky plants at your house that no sorry not at your house at <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s house</u>
<u n="76" who="S0680">yes</u>
<u n="77" who="S0679">that came from <anon type="address"/> probably originally?</u>
<u n="78" who="S0680" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="79" who="S0679">there's about half a dozen of them just sitting in water</u>
<u n="80" who="S0680">oh well <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>s</trunc> er some are in water and some are in little tiny pots</u>
<u n="81" who="S0679">oh well I think most of them are in water</u>
<u n="82" who="S0680">but they may have got too cold as well</u>
<u n="83" who="S0679" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="84" who="S0680">although they normally live in my north face they seem to like it in my north-facing sticky out window</u>
<u n="85" who="S0679">I think they look quite poorly sitting in water I'm thinking about taking them into productive protective custody</u>
<u n="86" who="S0680">you think I should have them taken from me?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0679">well I don't know until you can you know and and I can</u>
<u n="88" who="S0680" trans="overlap">until I'm</u>

<u n="628" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="629" who="S0680">erm because you couldn't use it <trunc>wha</trunc> you weren't supposed to use that as a through route because it was a classroom</u>

<u n="640" who="S0679">fifteen to sixteen</u>
<u n="641" who="S0680">no I think I can remember that <unclear/> and I think perhaps you could go in the library both ends but you couldn't go in the commerce room maybe that was it</u>
<u n="642" who="S0679">it would be quite handy for the staffroom to be able to get into both ends wouldn't it? it would save somebody having to all the way down and all the way up</u>

<u n="648" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="649" who="S0680">so it's quite a long way whereas you can just nip out the back door of the staffroom cos the teachers used to sunbathe up there on that <trunc>pat</trunc> thing</u>
