<u n="21" who="S0417">right don't do this I'm gonna show you how to cook rice</u>
<u n="22" who="S0416">okay</u>
<u n="23" who="S0417">just so that you'll know at one point but not now maybe using the cooker</u>
<u n="24" who="S0416">okay</u>
<u n="25" who="S0417" trans="overlap">cooker is a bit funny sometimes the gas goes on and off and I just I'd rather not especially with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> being <unclear>around</unclear> sometimes he's tall enough to reach <unclear>but anyway</unclear> so for rice</u>
<u n="26" who="S0416">mm</u>
<u n="27" who="S0417">erm actually what? best way is to get a cup <unclear/> <unclear>remember</unclear> how much for each person <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> I think it's about like maybe about a third or a half half might be too much actually</u>
<u n="28" who="S0416">that doesn't look like a lot of rice</u>
<u n="29" who="S0417">I know it's hard to judge cos it does get double the size when it's cooked or maybe even more</u>
<u n="30" who="S0416" trans="overlap">does it? ah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0417"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <trunc>y</trunc>you need to get changed you've had a shower today?</u>

<u n="38" who="S0416">can you not hear me? cos I'm pretty sure I'm always up at the same time as you</u>
<u n="39" who="S0417" trans="overlap">right now with</u>
<u n="40" who="S0416">yep</u>
<u n="41" who="S0417">pour that in pour that in the saucepan</u>
<u n="42" who="S0416">okay so pour about a third of rice and</u>
<u n="43" who="S0417">yeah that's probably too much to be honest and then go and fill up</u>
<u n="44" who="S0416">it might be</u>
<u n="45" who="S0417">fill up the water</u>
<u n="46" who="S0416">with the kettle?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0417">no fill up fill up that with cold water</u>
<u n="48" who="S0416">like to the brim?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0417" trans="overlap">to be to be the same amount of the as the rice</u>
<u n="50" who="S0416">do you mean like a third?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0417">yeah whatever the rice went up to put that up to</u>
<u n="52" who="S0416"><unclear/> think that's <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0417"><unclear/> <unclear>bit more I think</unclear></u>
<u n="54" who="S0416">oh</u>
<u n="55" who="S0417">okay er that's as much water you need <unclear/> like as much water as there is rice</u>
<u n="56" who="S0416"><unclear/></u>
<u n="57" who="S0417">put it on the thing this <unclear>ignites</unclear> it and then you put the lid on and you've gotta wait until it it's fifteen minutes from now</u>
<u n="58" who="S0416">so I will go <unclear>online</unclear> and I'll time it</u>
<u n="59" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0416">so so how do you how do you turn on <unclear>this</unclear>?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0417" trans="overlap">so it's three thirty-five but you have to watch it because it boils over really quickly</u>
<u n="62" who="S0416">how do you turn on the thing? cos all you just did is click the <unclear/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0417">you put put it in and turn it that puts the gas on</u>
<u n="64" who="S0416">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0417">and you ignite it</u>
<u n="66" who="S0416">and then that's that?</u>
<u n="67" who="S0417">yeah so you've gotta like not just leave it without putting the ignition on otherwise the gas is erm gas is dangerous without being ignited</u>
<u n="68" who="S0416" trans="overlap">so you've gotta gotta be like this and then you go like this this and then click that</u>
<u n="69" who="S0417">it er it's the other way I think</u>
<u n="70" who="S0416" trans="overlap">or whatever <trunc>posi</trunc> whatever position it's in</u>
<u n="71" who="S0417">mm it's this</u>
<u n="72" who="S0416"><unclear/></u>
<u n="73" who="S0417">with this rice you have to move it cos it's very difficult <unclear>kind of</unclear> to once it boils you've got to move it onto a lower temperature</u>
<u n="74" who="S0416">oh okay</u>
<u n="75" who="S0417">er</u>
<u n="76" who="S0416">so how do I do that? do I just go like <unclear>and then</unclear> move it back?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0417">well it doesn't really work very well on this oven that's why I <unclear>really</unclear> don't want you using it yet just to understand how it works first so I put on this one we can have a go put the simmer on <pause dur="short"/> do that hold it in and do that</u>
<u n="78" who="S0416">oh</u>
<u n="79" who="S0417">right</u>
<u n="80" who="S0416">do you want me to lower it? do I just do this again?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0417">don't do no that's off now put it on again <pause dur="short"/> to lower it you go that way</u>
<u n="82" who="S0416">this this way?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0417">yeah it's got a small <unclear/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0416">oh yeah so that's really low?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0417">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0416">and that's high?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0417">yeah turn it on again turn it off and turn it on again <unclear>just to</unclear></u>
<u n="88" who="S0416">oh okay</u>
<u n="89" who="S0417">turn it off again so what I have to do is when that boils cos er otherwise it makes a great big mess as well</u>
<u n="90" who="S0416">mm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0417">and rice can burn <unclear/> quite easily so there's not much rice in there it might actually take less than fifteen minutes then I've put it on to that on a low simmer not a high one</u>
<u n="92" who="S0416">so can you only tell by doing a clock from like fifteen to zero? or can you tell by like certain like noises? so if I didn't have a timer could I tell when it was ready?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0417"><unclear>well</unclear> that's the thing you have to move it half like part way you have to just keep an eye on it while it's boiling and it's starting to boil now <pause dur="short"/> it's starting to boil so now put that on</u>
<u n="94" who="S0416"><unclear>simmer</unclear>?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0417">yeah <pause dur="short"/> move that across put it on low</u>
<u n="96" who="S0416">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0417">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0416">how low?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0417">that's fine</u>
<u n="100" who="S0416">okay</u>
<u n="101" who="S0417">right right to right to then move that to that one <pause dur="short"/> must always keep the handle that way if you put it that way <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> can come and tip it on his head <unclear/> and that's on so we turn that off</u>
<u n="102" who="S0416">oh which way? this way?</u>
<u n="103" who="S0417" trans="overlap">that way <unclear>I think</unclear> yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="104" who="S0416">okay</u>
<u n="105" who="S0417">you didn't turn that all the way</u>
<u n="106" who="S0416">what do you mean?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0417">you didn't turn it all the way that way</u>
<u n="108" who="S0416">oh</u>
<u n="109" who="S0417">you didn't turn it all the way down</u>
<u n="110" who="S0416">oh is that <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0417">it's very very <trunc>l</trunc> it's very little</u>
<u n="112" who="S0416">is that piece broken?</u>
<u n="113" who="S0417">yeah that's why that's why it's very hard to use</u>
<u n="114" who="S0416" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="115" who="S0417">it's er quite easy to <unclear/> I never use the grill</u>
<u n="116" who="S0416" trans="overlap">I thought that was I thought that way the <unclear/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0417">yeah erm <unclear>should probably put that down</unclear> but you time it from the whole time so</u>
<u n="118" who="S0416">is that fifteen minutes?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0417"><unclear/> no <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you time the whole thing it's still <unclear>clicking</unclear></u>
<u n="120" who="S0416">oh</u>
<u n="121" who="S0417">it's not fifteen minutes until it boils</u>
<u n="122" who="S0416">okay</u>
<u n="123" who="S0417">and this is called simmering</u>
<u n="124" who="S0416">simmering</u>
<u n="125" who="S0417">simmering is when it's bubbling like this <pause dur="short"/> and the water's boiling</u>
<u n="126" who="S0416">shall I use two hands when putting it to a different one?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0417">it's always best to use like a more like to keep steady depends how confident you are if you're maybe at first use two hands and always keep the <trunc>ha</trunc> but it's important to always keep the handle that way <pause dur="short"/> because this way is really dangerous</u>
<u n="128" who="S0416">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0417"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> could just he'd be in hospital</u>
<u n="130" who="S0416">mm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0417">you know like that kid at school that had burns or something? do you or was that from a firework?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0416">that's from a firework that was from a firework his name was <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
