<u n="1" who="S0405">yeah it should sound fine</u>
<u n="2" who="S0402">what was I saying? oh <pause dur="short"/> yeah so the older you get</u>
<u n="3" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="4" who="S0402">the more useful it is to say that age and experience means that you're like better placed and more intelligent than someone because you're gonna be older and more <trunc>jus</trunc> well older than the majority of young people so</u>
<u n="5" who="S0405"><vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> do you think like youth are naturally inclined to be obnoxious?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0402">yeah to be I mean we don't know any better but sometimes we know better than the people that are older than us but <pause dur="short"/> because we're younger people generally dismiss us as quite unexperienced and foolish when we we do genuinely know it's like</u>
<u n="7" who="S0405" trans="overlap">so you</u>
<u n="8" who="S0402"><trunc>teach</trunc></u>
<u n="9" who="S0405" trans="overlap"><trunc>teach</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0402">it's like teachers in school right who is best placed to judge how well a teacher teaches?</u>
<u n="11" who="S0405">students</u>
<u n="12" who="S0402" trans="overlap">the students</u>
<u n="13" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0402">but there can never be a situation where students can judge teachers because the everyone</u>
<u n="15" who="S0405" trans="overlap">they're not yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0402"><trunc>ju</trunc> er thinks that we're too inexperienced we're too stupid we're too immature to make the decision when in in actual fact most of us aren't</u>
<u n="17" who="S0405">so do you think that so you do or don't think that intelligence brings that that that experience brings <trunc>in</trunc>intelligence?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0402">it does but they say that like for <unclear>draconically</unclear> everyone that's older than you is definitely more intelligent than you is wrong</u>
<u n="19" who="S0405">right</u>
<u n="20" who="S0402" trans="overlap">because there are some people that are older than us who are stupider than us</u>
<u n="21" who="S0405" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0402">but because they're older we have to show them like more respect for their intelligence and experience when it's less than ours and and just to just to say because we're younger than them that you know it means that</u>
<u n="23" who="S0405">does that annoy you?</u>
<u n="24" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0405"><vocal desc="laugh"/> sounds like</u>
<u n="26" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0405">it sounds like it annoys you</u>
<u n="28" who="S0402">sometimes you do knew know better than people that are older than you but you have no no power or influence because you're younger than them</u>
<u n="29" who="S0405">do you think we should have a right to tell them?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0402">we do and we exercise that but people will still dismiss it because we're younger than them it's not like we don't tell them <pause dur="short"/> like we try to get rid of</u>
<u n="31" who="S0405" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="32" who="S0402">Dr like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> tried to get rid of Dr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> like years ago</u>
<u n="33" who="S0405" trans="overlap">oh yeah oh my god</u>
<u n="34" who="S0402">well everyone just dismissed it as oh it's a kid that's just angry that just doesn't like the teacher rather than the teacher is genuinely poor</u>
<u n="35" who="S0405">no but that's because it was <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> as well</u>
<u n="36" who="S0402">it was signed by like forty people</u>
<u n="37" who="S0405">yeah I know</u>
<u n="38" who="S0402">it's just</u>
<u n="39" who="S0405">so <pause dur="short"/> to go back to the To Kill a Mockingbird story of er <pause dur="short"/> the lady that hates hates coloured people</u>
<u n="40" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0405">and er Atticus told him not to say anything cos she was old and she didn't know better</u>
<u n="42" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0405">do you think do you think that was the right thing or do you think they should have told her that she was wrong?</u>
<u n="44" who="S0402">well one if if Jem just tells her that you're wrong she isn't gonna she isn't gonna listen because she's older than Jem and therefore she must know better or something right? but</u>
<u n="45" who="S0405" trans="overlap">so cos it's pointless is that right?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0402" trans="overlap">it's pointless but that's not how why Atticus was saying er Atticus was saying you know you should be better and respect <trunc>res</trunc>respect older people when in fact the surely the er the the most respect you can give a person is to try and teach them and make them better so I think Jem should have given his opinion it might not have changed anything but he should have given his opinion</u>
<u n="47" who="S0405">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but do you think that the truth is always the best thing?</u>
<u n="48" who="S0402">the truth is the ultimate pure er a completely undoctored truth is like it's like you know perfect but people don't wanna hear the truth people can't accept the truth people look at the truth in different ways so</u>
<u n="49" who="S0405"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="50" who="S0402">it's much easier to put a slant on the truth and then to give it you know full flush that this is the truth</u>
<u n="51" who="S0405">so what if a lady <pause dur="short"/> in her dying days on her deathbed you had unconclusive proof inconclusive? I dunno proof that god didn't exist or that something that she believed in didn't exist or that there was an explanation for it would you tell her so that she could live knowing the truth? or would you but that say and say that wouldn't make her happier that would make her sadder</u>
<u n="52" who="S0402">yeah <trunc>tha</trunc> I get where you're coming from but</u>
<u n="53" who="S0405">I think that's one of the few places religion plays are a really positive role</u>
<u n="54" who="S0402">yeah I mean</u>
<u n="55" who="S0405" trans="overlap">not not few places er</u>
<u n="56" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah people deserve the truth but people don't want the truth people people know the truth it's like if you ask someone would you much rather I told you the truth about something or lied to you about it they'll say the truth all the time right?</u>
<u n="57" who="S0405">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0402">but they don't wanna hear the truth because</u>
<u n="59" who="S0405" trans="overlap">I know no</u>
<u n="60" who="S0402">the truth isn't what the truth they wanna hear the truth they wanna believe they'd much rather listen to something else and I would say and that one that that woman if you asked her do you want the truth about stuff? yeah it's in your dying days you you want the truth right? she'd say yeah er I definitely want the truth the truth is erm yes go on then but <trunc>sh</trunc> the second you tell her that <trunc>y</trunc>you shatter the truth that she's the the truth she's lived with in her in her world and you shatter that and <trunc>y</trunc>you take away what she's built up before erm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0402">yeah that that would be a completely hard one because</u>
<u n="63" who="S0405"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="64" who="S0402">er</u>
<u n="65" who="S0405">what's the er Karl Marx quote you know? religion is the opiate of the people or the opium something like that cos the people</u>
<u n="66" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0405">people get <pause dur="short"/> quite addicted to their religion and they don't want they don't wanna refuse it</u>
<u n="68" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0405" trans="overlap">you know they're addicted to it <pause dur="short"/> but then Michael Caine said <vocal desc="laugh"/> in the The Dark Knight Rises</u>
<u n="70" who="S0402"><unclear/></u>
<u n="71" who="S0405">sometimes we should let the truth what did he say? I dunno after you know he told that man that erm that the letter</u>
<u n="72" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0405">that that that that girl wrote him he burned it or whatever and it's like sometimes you've just got we should start trying to outsmart the truth I dunno something like that <pause dur="short"/> it's bad to take advice like that from films</u>
<u n="74" who="S0402">well no cos the the end of The Dark Knight the er <pause dur="short"/> it is the like the most <pause dur="short"/> the the the best <pause dur="short"/> er that's not I think that's the thing that people should draw through about what the truth is and and how it should be the er where where he says that you know he killed Harvey and all those cops and that it was his fault and that he he should be hunted down because he said something like people deserve sometimes people deserve more than the truth erm people deserve better er better than they can be given and er so he'll he'll he'll take the hit for it because he wants to give people hope and and make them feel better erm if you ask people would you want the truth er er of of Gotham they would have said yes but it would have shattered their world <pause dur="short"/> now <trunc>i</trunc>it <trunc>i</trunc>it's a different question if you you ask them if you want a truth er it's a it's a er a real truth but it's gonna shatter your world it's gonna destroy the foundations that it's built on then they then <trunc>th</trunc> then it gives them a problem of whether they accept something they said was pure and brilliant and that that they'd won just like five seconds ago or or did they do they wanna save what they've built for themselves already? and er</u>
<u n="75" who="S0405">I think everyone has their own like role in Gotham City though <pause dur="short"/> cos then <pause dur="short"/> there is <pause dur="short"/> there is a system of you know there's workers there's there's er Italian <pause dur="short"/> er boss mafia</u>
<u n="76" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0405" trans="overlap">bosses there's there's the rich and the aristocrats like Bruce Wayne's family</u>
<u n="78" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0405">and everyone lives but it's only when it starts getting unfair and worse for people obviously the people at the bottom like you know they always talk about Gotham's underbelly it's when it gets worse for them that's when Batman chooses to do something other times <pause dur="short"/> you know he doesn't or er at least that's probably what Thomas Wayne felt you know that's how they got that's how the city runs</u>
<u n="80" who="S0402">well didn't he</u>
<u n="81" who="S0405" trans="overlap">or in or or like in Gotham er you know erm Jim Gordon's meant to be you know the symbol of absolute er</u>
<u n="82" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0405" trans="overlap">good good morality but yet in the end he chooses to allow Falcone to live on because the city needs him</u>
<u n="84" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0405">so that's being pragmatic that's being smart about it that's erm <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="86" who="S0402" trans="overlap">but the world the world needs two types of heroes one</u>
<u n="87" who="S0405"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="88" who="S0402">it does it well one</u>
<u n="89" who="S0405" trans="overlap">the ones it deserves and the ones</u>
<u n="90" who="S0402" trans="overlap">no no the the ones that that will give the world the people of the world hope right? the figures right?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0402" trans="overlap">so your Mandelas your er your Martin Luther Kings your your er</u>
<u n="93" who="S0405" trans="overlap">Gandhis</u>
<u n="94" who="S0402">your Gandhis yeah? people you you need that right? people that are absolute right? they might not have the greatest change sometimes their actions may be negative but at the end of the day they're the they're the the be-all and end-all the absolute figure of of good right?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0402">and then other times you need people that are gonna do the dirty work that the people that at the end of the day aren't gonna be looked on as heroes because their actions aren't inherently heroic when you look at it erm cos you need those kind of people because at the end of the day those are the ones that are gonna get stuff done</u>
<u n="97" who="S0405" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="98" who="S0402">I mean it's all good well and good giving speeches and stuff but unless you you you have a <trunc>y</trunc>you act upon it it's meaningless right?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0405">and which of those do you think is Batman?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0402"><trunc>B</trunc> well Batman is not the absolute hero</u>
<u n="101" who="S0405">no but I think he I think he makes a transition from er Dark Knight he chose to do</u>
<u n="102" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0405">the dark that people didn't want him to do</u>
<u n="104" who="S0402">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0405">you know he was the Dark Knight whereas er two <trunc>f</trunc> well Harvey Dent was the white knight</u>
<u n="106" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0405">and then in Dark Knight Rises he ends up becoming a symbol because</u>
<u n="108" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0405" trans="overlap">he hasn't been there for so long a symbol of what's right</u>
<u n="110" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0405">erm <pause dur="short"/> but people know that you know but he became the point was he became the symbol of evil to people cos people had thought that he killed Harvey Dent</u>
<u n="112" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0405">but people like orphans and er and er and some of the good cops they knew that Batman was really</u>
<u n="114" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0405">the good person and you know he stood for a symbol as much</u>
<u n="116" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0405">and er yeah and then you go back to Batman Begins and I think the reason why er er Bruce Wayne was first said he was gonna take on the Batman was cos he had become a symbol</u>
<u n="118" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0405" trans="overlap">for more than more than just going out and fighting crime</u>
<u n="120" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0405">and obviously Alfred preferred that cos he'd get less hurt and stuff erm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0402">yeah I know but but erm <pause dur="short"/> did <trunc>th</trunc> the way Batman the wanted to become a symbol was that er not a symbol of hope he never never tried to be a symbol of hope more erm a symbol of of fear to to inspire fear within the criminals so that they wouldn't</u>
<u n="123" who="S0405" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="124" who="S0402">they would never again erm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0405">yeah I suppose</u>
<u n="126" who="S0402" trans="overlap">do do do wrong but yeah obviously in the end he becomes a a symbol of of hope but originally er <trunc>y</trunc><trunc>y</trunc>yeah that's why you know</u>
<u n="127" who="S0405">maybe at the end of the third movie when he's finally sacrificed himself</u>
<u n="128" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0405" trans="overlap">and they do that statue of him</u>
<u n="130" who="S0402">mm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0405">maybe that's the the final only time when he</u>
<u n="132" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0405">becomes hope</u>
<u n="134" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0405">I think Superman's meant to be the symbol of hope</u>
<u n="136" who="S0402">yeah <trunc>S</trunc>Superman</u>
<u n="137" who="S0405">but he's so much more boring and placid and dull</u>
<u n="138" who="S0402" trans="overlap">it is yeah <trunc>th</trunc>that's it he's he</u>
<u n="139" who="S0405" trans="overlap">cos that is it</u>
<u n="140" who="S0402">he is the ultimate be all of end of all of good you know he he does</u>
<u n="141" who="S0405" trans="overlap">at least Batman admits he has faults</u>
<u n="142" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0405">Superman messes up all the time too <pause dur="short"/> doesn't he?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0402">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and and yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="145" who="S0405">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so why do more people root for Batman? cos he's a more awesome hero? or because they actually stand for what he he stands for more?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0402">er <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I mean</u>
<u n="147" who="S0405">it's just cos he's more popular</u>
<u n="148" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah he's got so much more depth</u>
<u n="149" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0402"><unclear/></u>
<u n="151" who="S0405">his villains are better <pause dur="short"/> his city is better <pause dur="short"/> his alias is better</u>
<u n="152" who="S0402">he gets better writers</u>
<u n="153" who="S0405">yep <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="154" who="S0402">better movies</u>
<u n="155" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0402"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I mean the way he's been I mean like any character which has multiple writers he's been portrayed differently like every time</u>
<u n="157" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="158" who="S0402">which is which is nice but like The Dark Knight Returns is a really good one</u>
<u n="159" who="S0405">oh yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="S0402" trans="overlap">if you if you read or watch that</u>
<u n="161" who="S0405">I actually need <trunc>re</trunc> or watch it properly</u>
<u n="162" who="S0402" trans="overlap"><trunc>wha</trunc><trunc>wha</trunc>watch it watch it it's really good</u>
<u n="163" who="S0405" trans="overlap">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0402" trans="overlap">because he goes from being like <pause dur="short"/> a symbol of like nothing because he he's been gone for ten years to becoming not like a <trunc>s</trunc> well it's you know a symbol for hope rather than <pause dur="short"/> a symbol for fear</u>
<u n="165" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0402">and er</u>
<u n="167" who="S0405">cos he's old</u>
<u n="168" who="S0402"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="169" who="S0405">do you think it's gonna it's not gonna spoil any of the Superman versus but I know that they said that the Superman versus Batman film is its own independent story that the writers created and it shouldn't be looked at like with comic book history at all or something they're basically <trunc>th</trunc> trying to cover themselves</u>
<u n="170" who="S0402">well basically selling the exact same fight scene that they're they're gonna lift from</u>
<u n="171" who="S0405">right</u>
<u n="172" who="S0402">from er dynamic and</u>
<u n="173" who="S0405">I think they should like separate themselves from</u>
<event desc="sound of intercom"/>
<u n="174" who="S0405">they're just trying to move er the idea of cos they I dunno they're trying to pretend that they're better than Marvel movies</u>
<u n="175" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0405" trans="overlap">cos Marvel movies have become I really like them but they've become really mainstream</u>
<u n="177" who="S0402">yeah cashed out but</u>
<u n="178" who="S0405">yeah and like like comical and erm like one of main DC people were just like yeah <trunc>w</trunc>we're gonna make a film that stands for yeah it was on the Suicide Squad panel</u>
<u n="179" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="180" who="S0405">you know like we're gonna make a film that stands for the values that DC films stands for erm faithfulness to their comics erm like good plotlines and good characters or something like that</u>
<u n="181" who="S0402">oh I never read</u>
<u n="182" who="S0405" trans="overlap">I can't</u>
<u n="183" who="S0402">read Marvel comics but I can't see why they wouldn't achieve that</u>
<u n="184" who="S0405" trans="overlap">I know <trunc>m</trunc>most of the time I hear that oh <pause dur="short"/> I know I know I know most people feel that DC comics are better written though</u>
<u n="185" who="S0402">oh er yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0405">right? or it's just the characters are better</u>
<u n="187" who="S0402">the the characters are better and they're better written</u>
<u n="188" who="S0405">then why can't they make a successful DCCU?</u>
<u n="189" who="S0402">because erm because they they look at what they think works and they they look at what</u>
<u n="190" who="S0405" trans="overlap">in their field</u>
<u n="191" who="S0402">at how what the yeah they look at The Dark Knight and seen how like dark it was compared to the</u>
<u n="192" who="S0405" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="193" who="S0402">the Marvel universe</u>
<u n="194" who="S0405" trans="overlap">that's really bad</u>
<u n="195" who="S0402">er er and they've look at at what they wanna be as in comparison to Marvel and try to differentiate themselves erm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0405" trans="overlap">too much though</u>
<u n="197" who="S0402">er and and then they completely overshot</u>
<u n="198" who="S0405">yeah I think I think they've got the wrong end of the picture the success of The Dark Knight films</u>
<u n="199" who="S0402" trans="overlap">well yeah which is which is why the Suicide Squad trailer looks so so dark and boring and and no comedy</u>
<u n="200" who="S0405" trans="overlap">they just need to come out with a really funny movie</u>
<u n="201" who="S0402">yeah be good</u>
<u n="202" who="S0405" trans="overlap">maybe they tried it with Green Lantern but they just didn't put enough time into it</u>
<u n="203" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="204" who="S0405" trans="overlap">you know so they tried the flamboyant <trunc>mov</trunc> <trunc>r</trunc> you know proper</u>
<u n="205" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="206" who="S0405">Marvel like movies like Green Lantern and failed they they tried it with serious Dark Knight and it was the biggest like</u>
<u n="207" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="208" who="S0405" trans="overlap">box office they'd ever had so I can see why they're doing it didn't really work with Man of Steel though did it? I mean</u>
<u n="209" who="S0402">yeah that</u>
<u n="210" who="S0405" trans="overlap">did you see that that video of like the the different colour tones they had?</u>
<u n="211" who="S0402" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="212" who="S0405">like <pause dur="short"/> that was probably exaggerated but it's made so much sense</u>
<u n="213" who="S0402">yeah yeah yeah like <trunc>i</trunc>it is what they're trying to go for</u>
<u n="214" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="215" who="S0402" trans="overlap">and <vocal desc="sigh"/> I</u>
<u n="216" who="S0405" trans="overlap">just don't want them to F it up</u>
<u n="217" who="S0402">yeah it looks that way</u>
<u n="218" who="S0405" trans="overlap">so so what's Arrow like do you think? is that like serious?</u>
<u n="219" who="S0402">well it it it it's oh <pause dur="short"/> what <trunc>th</trunc>they were clever enough to to make it serious but have loads of comical <trunc>ele</trunc>elements of it?</u>
<u n="220" who="S0405">yeah okay</u>
<u n="221" who="S0402">so it's not you know like Dark Knight but you can't achieve that level of darkness just with</u>
<u n="222" who="S0405">just by creating it</u>
<u n="223" who="S0402" trans="overlap">one hour slots you need to the whole thing about a movie is that you build it using sounds cinematography throughout a consistent sustained like two three hours</u>
<u n="224" who="S0405">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="225" who="S0402">er and and you use that to make people you know feel a certain way and and respond a certain way and you can't really do that as well with a series because it's it's broken up you can you can try</u>
<u n="226" who="S0405" trans="overlap">you have more time though to develop the characters like</u>
<u n="227" who="S0402" trans="overlap">you can develop a character which is is great but you can't</u>
<u n="228" who="S0405" trans="overlap">but not yeah yeah</u>
<u n="229" who="S0402" trans="overlap"><trunc>d</trunc> it's really hard to sustain erm an emotion a running emotion of someone or or make them feel a certain way or use</u>
<u n="230" who="S0405">mm</u>
<u n="231" who="S0402">use like erm filters or cinematography or or the the way light shines or whatever to to make it look like you know use that to tell a story because</u>
<u n="232" who="S0405">yeah I get you</u>
<u n="233" who="S0402" trans="overlap">it's not sustained</u>
<u n="234" who="S0405">yeah I get you apparently the action scenes are amazing though</u>
<u n="235" who="S0402">yeah they're really they're really well done</u>
<u n="236" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="237" who="S0402">but it's got to the point where it's a bit of a joke though</u>
<u n="238" who="S0405">really?</u>
<u n="239" who="S0402" whoConfidence="low">yeah cos it's just like it used to be like really like oh wow that's amazing but then you do it all the time and so</u>

<u n="241" who="S0402">yeah <vocal desc="cough"/> and <trunc>th</trunc> and then then you start you see it so so many times that you start picking the faults in it</u>
<u n="242" who="S0405">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="243" who="S0402">there's this one scene where where he shoots an arrow up into the sky right <vocal desc="laugh"/> there's nothing there there's no building or whatever he just grapples away</u>
<u n="244" who="S0405">what? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="266" who="S0405" trans="overlap">nah</u>
<u n="267" who="S0402" trans="overlap">you basically every every episode was just oh there's a crime a a completely unrelated crime to the main plot let's go and solve that</u>
<u n="268" who="S0405" trans="overlap">I I think they really do it pretty well I mean some episodes you completely disjointed but</u>
<u n="269" who="S0402">yeah I know but</u>
<u n="270" who="S0405" trans="overlap">others they were like</u>
<u n="271" who="S0402">it was too much</u>
<u n="272" who="S0405" trans="overlap">it was leading to the Penguin thing</u>
<u n="273" who="S0402">it was too much just like a cop show like erm</u>
<u n="274" who="S0405" trans="overlap">I I was pretty invested in Penguin and</u>
<u n="275" who="S0402">yeah I I I I know but but the like the bulk of the show the bulk like seventy percent was just a cop show</u>
<u n="276" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="277" who="S0402">it was like oh crime here let's go oh that guy's a stereotypical guy that's probably done it</u>
<u n="278" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="279" who="S0402" trans="overlap">so we'll go and put him we'll question him oh wait it this evidence says it could be</u>
<u n="280" who="S0405" trans="overlap">I know but</u>

<u n="286" who="S0405">so what do you think they should what <trunc>wou</trunc> do you think they should try and find themselves as as a show?</u>
<u n="287" who="S0402">move away from the <unclear>I dunno</unclear></u>
<u n="288" who="S0405">I think they're gonna get more into the villains which er more in-depth villains than you know the Balloonman or a goat or a a Professor Pyg or whatever</u>
<u n="289" who="S0402">yeah I <trunc>j</trunc></u>

<u n="294" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="295" who="S0402" trans="overlap">because people have seen it too many times but I really think they</u>
<u n="296" who="S0405">I'd see it again though</u>
<u n="297" who="S0402">you you you never watched US Office but the first season they they tried to copy exactly what the first season of the original Office was</u>
<u n="298" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="299" who="S0402">and it was awful</u>
<u n="300" who="S0405">oh</u>
<u n="301" who="S0402">it it was completely terrible because</u>
<u n="302" who="S0405">is that just cos it was American though?</u>
<u n="303" who="S0402">yeah because it was an <trunc>Amer</trunc> and it was a it was a load of Americans trying to copy what the British had done so well right?</u>
<u n="304" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="305" who="S0402" trans="overlap">it was tried and tested comedy but they tried to do it the exact same and emulate it and it was awful</u>
<u n="306" who="S0405">wasn't that just because like Americans and British people have different humour though?</u>
<u n="307" who="S0402">not but but the well my point is that they would they they tried to copy something that was tried and tested</u>
<u n="308" who="S0405">right yeah</u>
<u n="309" who="S0402">right? erm and it ended up just being so boring</u>
<u n="310" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="311" who="S0402">because of that er and in the second season they did so they they they created a series that was completely different from from the er</u>
<u n="312" who="S0405">god</u>
<u n="313" who="S0402">the British er British season er series and it was it was almost apart from characters and the the <unclear/> of some episodes some classic episodes it was unrecognisable in comparison</u>
<u n="314" who="S0405">well it reminds me of er <vocal desc="laugh"/> when they tried to do the er oh shall I tap out?</u>
<u n="315" who="S0402">yeah you've gotta tap</u>
<u n="316" who="S0405">oh right and so it reminds me of The Inbetweeners when they tried to do The Inbetweeners in America <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="317" who="S0402">that's it now <anon type="place"/> or</u>
<u n="318" who="S0405">either</u>
<u n="319" who="S0402">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="320" who="S0405">yeah when they tried to do er The Inbetweeners</u>
<u n="321" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="322" who="S0405">in America it was <trunc>j</trunc> awful</u>
<u n="323" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="324" who="S0405">awful</u>
<u n="325" who="S0402">that always happens cos there's this stupid <unclear/> cos the Americans are all big and flamboyant and that really works for them and it is it is quite funny right?</u>
<u n="326" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0402">but the second they try and use the British humour and did it it was awful</u>
<u n="328" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="329" who="S0402">like Steve Carell is hilarious but the second they try and make him do British humour he was just terrible</u>
<u n="330" who="S0405">yeah <pause dur="short"/> how are you?</u>
<u n="331" who="S0402">but then the second they let him do his own thing he <trunc>wa</trunc> everyone loved</u>
<u n="332" who="S0405">that's why Ben Affleck has to be an amazing Batman because we're gonna be invested in</u>
<u n="333" who="S0402">yeah</u>
<u n="334" who="S0405">for at least another two movies <vocal desc="laugh"/> oh <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="335" who="S0402">yeah I really hope they <trunc>d</trunc> they don't go oh erm Heath Ledger the Joker best emulate him Christian Bale will <unclear/></u>
<u n="336" who="S0405" trans="overlap">I don't think he's doing that like Suicide Squad I don't think he's doing that</u>
<u n="337" who="S0402">but also</u>
<u n="338" who="S0405">I think he's trying to just stay as far away from Heath Ledger as he can</u>
<u n="339" who="S0402">but also don't go the other way and make it so far away from him because you're scared of of of going anywhere into his territory that</u>
<u n="340" who="S0405">I know yeah</u>
<u n="341" who="S0402" trans="overlap">it's just it it it's no longer the character that you were you were looking for that's why they should just make it funny right? cos cos like I get that it's really hard to be funny</u>
<u n="342" who="S0405">oh yeah</u>
<u n="343" who="S0402">like really hard but</u>
<u n="344" who="S0405" trans="overlap">it's <trunc>har</trunc> it's hard for me</u>

<u n="346" who="S0405">I still do it I manage</u>
<u n="347" who="S0402" trans="overlap">but maybe that's why they try and stay away from it but <pause dur="short"/> it's not that hard <trunc>th</trunc><trunc>th</trunc>they I'd rather they give that a shot of that than try and be like dark funny</u>
<u n="348" who="S0405">yeah</u>
