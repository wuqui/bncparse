You've got kind of bits of north London Wembley um I don't know <pause dur="short"/> you know it would be interesting to find out where the poshest Asian place is <pause dur="short"/> I don't think there are many <pause dur="short"/> I think there's just like kind of like you know <trunc>m</trunc> majority are ghettos</u>
<u n="118" who="S0073">have you</u>

<u n="125" who="S0018">I think so <pause dur="short"/> I've I've thought about it quite a lot <pause dur="short"/> I mean if I had the opportunity to live elsewhere I would take it but that's you know everyone says that <pause dur="short"/> but unfortunately that's down to economics</u>
<u n="126" who="S0073">uh hmm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0018">if you want to have a second home somewhere good luck cos you'll be working all your life doing it <pause dur="short"/> if you're a very rich person <vocal desc="cough"/> or you enjoy shit loads of money then you can uh you know I suppose you can afford to live anywhere and good luck to you <pause dur="short"/> but when you've got family responsibilities when you've got you know like me I've an ageing grandfather I've got an <trunc>ol</trunc> old getting old mum and dad I have a family business and the thing is that I I say that those things are are important <pause dur="short"/> they're also very practical as well</u>
<u n="128" who="S0073">hmm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0018">I mean I gain a lot of privilege from having family business <pause dur="short"/> uh they're a pain in the ass as well <vocal desc="laugh"/> But if yeah I mean potentially it would be nice just to do London for a bit <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/>'s great because it's got largest amounts of um uh I suppose Asian people black people within you know kind of the west midlands <pause dur="short"/> it's been home for my granddad my dad and me uh</u>

<u n="133" who="S0018">um so in that way it's kind of yeah and also Brum's home I suppose <pause dur="short"/> but don't get me wrong I mean if I  if I  had the moneys I I'd you know I'd go to Barcelona or Valencia at the drop of a hat</u>

<u n="142" who="S0073">how come he can do his job from Valencia?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0018">Cos I think a lot of the stuff that he does is correspondence and because he's learnt how to um take certain kind of classes or or teach certain excuse me certain classes to do with uh um you know <trunc>con</trunc> conflict resolution and and so on very kind of I think  I think  once you've  once you've  got kind of a model down for um you know what conflict resolution is or or what you know uh you know kind of uh poverty um uh global development or anti-poverty stuff <pause dur="short"/> once you've got those kind of things down you can just apply to you know a specific geography and go well right this country's got these problems so a person from whoever beware of this beware of that conflict resolution is about X Y and Z thank you very much <pause dur="short"/> I'll take three thousand pounds for that lesson</u>

Um and and and not just earn money ourselves but put something back and um he said well okay let's let's start something up <pause dur="short"/> and there's something called the community interest company that you'd now make rather than being uh an out and out imperial capitalistic whore <vocal desc="laugh"/> you can actually do something where you incorporate a company and all of the assets and everything that the all the profits of that company</u>

<u n="235" who="S0018">itself or or or or a <trunc>commun</trunc> or or the specific role that that company is</u>
<u n="236" who="S0073">oh it's like a little NGO?</u>
<u n="237" who="S0018">similar to like an NGO <pause dur="short"/> yeah but it's it's it's it still allows you to be able to earn a wage and it also allows you to be able to do positive pivotal things for a community</u>
<u n="238" who="S0073">hmm</u>
<u n="239" who="S0018">or the community <pause dur="short"/> so we've just set one up <pause dur="short"/> well we've just set the paper off yesterday to companies now so hopefully um hopefully that will  that will  come off <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>we</trunc> we've called ourselves True Form Development</u>

<u n="253" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="254" who="S0073">but then what would you do with it when you've compiled it all and?</u>
<u n="255" who="S0018">hmm <pause dur="short"/> well they'll be a couple of things <pause dur="short"/> they'll be a maybe a short doc film thing <pause dur="short"/> we'll have an exhibition or an event</u>
<u n="256" who="S0073">hmm</u>
<u n="257" who="S0018">um we'll be putting all of our findings online as a kind of online archive</u>
<u n="258" who="S0073">hmm</u>
<u n="259" who="S0018">we will then look to probably get our stuff put into archive at <anon type="place"/> at <anon type="place"/> uh Library and then off the basis of those four five outputs we'll we'll see I mean potentially there's part two and part three to this project next year or the year after <pause dur="short"/> but we'll have to see if it if it's  if it's  if it creates a buzz within the community if it's something worthwhile otherwise we'll go under and uh  and uh and uh  yeah <pause dur="short"/> but potentially yeah we we we're going to maybe do a few bits of music um taking the kind of the bits of um music that an older generation the younger generation like and fusing it together</u>
<u n="260" who="S0073">oh cool</u>
<u n="261" who="S0018">uh we'll be doing a number of video diaries you know just to kind of in terms of um <trunc>wh</trunc> what it's like for um a normal day for a young person and a <trunc>you</trunc> a normal day for a a person who's slightly older</u>

<u n="265" who="S0018">going through the you know underwear drawers</u>
<u n="266" who="S0073">and how are you going to source the the participants?</u>
<u n="267" who="S0018">well we're looking to source <trunc>d</trunc> we're going to do a big troll of about a hundred two hundred specific people um because it the community's just too huge <pause dur="short"/> we're going to have to poster campaign and so on</u>
<u n="268" who="S0073">uh hmm</u>
<u n="269" who="S0018">with a number and that people can contact <pause dur="short"/> but um I mean even if we can find between ten fifteen people essentially that should be enough for the project</u>
<u n="270" who="S0073">hmm</u>
<u n="271" who="S0018">to be able to I think show effective what the project is set out to do <pause dur="short"/> and I'm quite confident we'll get  we'll get  that <pause dur="short"/> but let's let's just hope that people are kind of open um to it <pause dur="short"/> so um</u>
<u n="272" who="S0073">I'm sure they would be <pause dur="short"/> people love speaking about themselves</u>

<u n="275" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm hoping so <pause dur="short"/> cos uh you know it's also  it's also  kind of nice because um in previous projects it's just been like oh yeah we're doing project blah blah <pause dur="short"/> but now because of the family aspect because he's got a little one uh and also because of the fact that um you know wanting to do a lot more of my own stuff away from the family business we've kind of come together at exactly the right it feels like the right time like hungry to do something <pause dur="short"/> so so yeah</u>
<u n="276" who="S0073">hmm</u>
<u n="277" who="S0018">hopefully it will be a good  a good  one</u>

<u n="293" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="294" who="S0073">Cos once you're in a pub it's it's not normal to drink something that's non alcoholic either is it?</u>
<u n="295" who="S0018">but I've also seen the <trunc>eff</trunc> I've seen the effect on me of booze <pause dur="short"/> I've seen the effect on people around me <pause dur="short"/> I've seen the effect of good friends of mine <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> good friends of mine <pause dur="short"/> mutual friends on booze um I've actually had to step in on a couple of occasions on like like not just  not just  people like who who are very close to me but even like  even like  friends of friends and I feel as though I have the fucking authority now to be able to go I think you've had too much <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="296" who="S0073">yeah</u>
<u n="297" who="S0018">when it gets to the evening and you know like at some point in the evening like I've had it here a couple of times where like a mate of a mate has come over and is just talking utter fucking drivel and because everyone is just a bit too civil they'll just go oh that's the end of the night  the end of the night  is gonna be me listening to this cock and I'm not gonna be able to do anything about it <pause dur="short"/> and I've just started going you know what? You've had enough swing your hook or you've had enough shut up and listen to the people who are funny or who can still put two syllables together</u>
<u n="298" who="S0073" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I know <pause dur="short"/> drunk people they feel that they have to monologue</u>
<u n="299" who="S0018">well which is  which is  fine <pause dur="short"/> I mean I've done that but I just  I just  kind of I I I enjoy the fact that there is someone at least a little bit more compos mentis who's able to say you know something a little bit more interesting <pause dur="short"/> but the worst thing is when you have you know two or three people who are completely pissed which can be funny but when they are either arguing against each other or talking utter nonsense it's a bit problematic <pause dur="short"/> uh for instance last week I was in London um went to Kentish Town to meet an old friend of mine</u>
<u n="300" who="S0073">oh <pause dur="short"/> is that where <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> used to live?</u>
<u n="301" who="S0018">yeah she said yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> um so we went to this <trunc>pu</trunc> I was I always said this didn't I? The whole race issue and uh he he was like kinda you know after after a meal and you've had a bit of few whiskeys and so on <pause dur="short"/> he tried convincing me that racism came from chimps</u>
<u n="302" who="S0073">that's right</u>
<u n="303" who="S0018">and I was</u>
<u n="304" who="S0073">it's not right but I remember you saying</u>
<u n="305" who="S0018">and I was  and I was  just like uh we've known each other for ages and and I just maybe I don't really know you you know and my my brother is his son's godfather <pause dur="short"/> which is very strange for a Muslim man <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="306" who="S0073">but was it actually that much of a contentious</u>
<u n="307" who="S0018" trans="overlap">well yeah it was cos</u>
<u n="308" who="S0073">statement?</u>
<u n="309" who="S0018">yeah because it kinda well because of the fact that we were actually where it led from was Empire and we started</u>
<u n="310" who="S0073">oh okay</u>
<u n="311" who="S0018">then we started talking about racism and what he tried and did was to try and shift the subject of the conversation to being you know kind of something that <trunc>g</trunc> genealogical? Genealogy?</u>
<u n="312" who="S0073">genealogical?</u>
<u n="313" who="S0018"><trunc>Genealo</trunc> genealogical</u>

We'll join you in a few minutes <pause dur="short"/> uh um after these words <pause dur="short"/> um so um so yeah it it was kind of him trying to change into a kind of um a biological argument and a sociological argument without looking at the history of racism but trying to jump back you know to the beginnings of time which unfortunately a lot of people tend to do when it comes to either religious racial or ethnic based argument it comes back to either the big bang or measuring skulls and I just found that just a bit fucking obtuse <pause dur="short"/> um but anyway regardless um yeah the point is that you know it's important I suppose just to be able to keep uh track of what you're saying <pause dur="short"/> not get completely so wankered that you're actually dribbling <vocal desc="laugh"/> in someone's face</u>
<u n="316" who="S0073">yes there are the fair few dribblers</u>

You're gonna end in it's gonna end in tears <pause dur="short"/> so that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> I think you can't get that drunk till you can't think <pause dur="short"/> I think that's uh something for British society to maybe think about</u>
