<u n="506" who="S0012">don't you want to be burnt up?</u>
<u n="507" who="S0278">what I don't understand some somewhere along the lines the er you go halfway the new bit in the field the gravestones are facing one way and then halfway back they're turned around they're facing the other way which means you can only put people in the grave one way and that's head to the east isn't it?</u>
<u n="508" who="S0012">yes</u>
<u n="509" who="S0278">erm but why have the stones <vocal desc="laugh"/> why are they one way?</u>
<u n="510" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="511" who="S0278">at the far side of the <trunc>cro</trunc> that big cross which I I don't really like that big cross but</u>
<u n="512" who="S0013" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="513" who="S0278">but and then they're around the other way it's very peculiar I don't know</u>
<u n="514" who="S0013">no</u>
<u n="515" who="S0278">or shall we say say they're the other end of the graves</u>
<u n="516" who="S0012">why do they always have to face east for the head?</u>
<u n="517" who="S0278" trans="overlap">well it's just <trunc>tra</trunc>tradition well</u>
<u n="518" who="S0012">because east is Mecca as well?</u>
<u n="519" who="S0278">well I think I think I think I'm right when I say east it is well it's one way or the other but the church that where the altar's always at the east end</u>
<u n="520" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="521" who="S0278">cos the church</u>
<u n="522" who="S0013" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="523" who="S0278">started off erm why the main body of the church is called the nave is because it was naval the ship</u>
<u n="524" who="S0012" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="525" who="S0278">it was a ship you see and you you enter the ship from the bow end</u>
<u n="526" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="527" who="S0278">bit and so always the door is at the end of the nave and it and it's life going through the church you start off in the fonts the west end</u>
<u n="528" who="S0013" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="529" who="S0278">don't you?</u>
<u n="530" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="531" who="S0278">your your church life and you gradually head and then the bit and everybody's all up the east end that that's how it all progressed</u>
<u n="532" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="533" who="S0278">erm and and the high altar's at the east end and the east is also where the sun rises every morning</u>
<u n="534" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="535" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="536" who="S0278">and comes in</u>
<u n="537" who="S0012">does it?</u>
<u n="538" who="S0278">so it's the bright it's the brightest bit of the church</u>
<u n="539" who="S0012"><unclear/></u>
<u n="540" who="S0278">you gave me a lovely little book you know on church architecture</u>
<u n="541" who="S0013">oh yeah</u>
<u n="542" who="S0278">and it's really interesting that</u>
<u n="543" who="S0013" trans="overlap">is it?</u>
<u n="544" who="S0278">the erm and <trunc>i</trunc>if you if you look at all the sites where churches are looking at looking at the whole land they own</u>
<u n="545" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="546" who="S0278">this sort of thing it's always on the northern edge of the plot</u>
<u n="547" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="548" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="549" who="S0278">and that's also because erm the favourite favourite part for burials was to the south in the warm in the sun you see in the brightest bit north of the church is dark</u>
<u n="550" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="551" who="S0278">and that was considered you were very lowly if you got put there you see</u>
<u n="552" who="S0012" trans="overlap">oh I see</u>
<u n="553" who="S0278">you couldn't go into that other bit and also if you'd and that's why that the church is placed there to the north side</u>
<u n="554" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="555" who="S0278">and you have a big long path to get to the church normally it comes up from the south</u>
<u n="556" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0278"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and and that means that that if you if you're favoured and you were along the side of the path everyone gets to remember you all the time as you're</u>
<u n="558" who="S0012" trans="overlap">I see well I suppose</u>
<u n="559" who="S0278">but people at the north no one <trunc>ge</trunc> no one gets to see the people buried around the north side</u>
<u n="560" who="S0012"><anon type="place"/> is north south ain't it?</u>
<u n="561" who="S0278">erm yeah the the the well it's east west the church</u>
<u n="562" who="S0012">you walk in</u>
<u n="563" who="S0278">you walk in at the south and you walk up towards the north to go through the door</u>
<u n="564" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah yeah it is isn't it?</u>
<u n="565" who="S0278">yeah yeah it is exactly that it's exactly right yeah</u>
<u n="566" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="567" who="S0278"><anon type="place"/> slightly strange in that in that I suppose it was I don't know because of the lane that goes up past it</u>
<u n="568" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="569" who="S0278">erm but then the land it owns goes right the way across that field</u>
<u n="570" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="571" who="S0278">you see</u>
<u n="572" who="S0013" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="573" who="S0278">so it is on the north side of the land it owns</u>
<u n="574" who="S0012">they must have flogged that bit of land that lane that goes up past it cos there's houses up there isn't there as well?</u>
<u n="575" who="S0278">I know but I doubt probably there's a right of way across it or something but</u>
<u n="576" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="577" who="S0278">but the field is the church</u>
<u n="578" who="S0012">yeah</u>

<u n="580" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="581" who="S0278">erm and that's why <trunc>they</trunc>they'll never run out of space for the graveyard there because they can just keep going out <unclear/></u>
<u n="582" who="S0012" trans="overlap">keep going forever won't they?</u>
<u n="583" who="S0278">yeah yeah but the the <trunc>t</trunc> you know there's there's <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and it's funny cos one service when I hadn't been at the church for long there they said and we really want to thank erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> for the work that they're doing here cos they they've really that church is beautiful inside now</u>
