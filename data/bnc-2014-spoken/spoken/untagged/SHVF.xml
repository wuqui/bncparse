<u n="5" who="S0417">they were very cute weren't they?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0416">yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0417">do you think though they might be quite vicious?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0416">erm <pause dur="short"/> I don't think they'd be vicious towards me but I think they could feck up furniture</u>
<u n="9" who="S0417">yeah?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0416">yeah so that's why I'd keep them outside</u>
<u n="11" who="S0417"><unclear/> they do ah look they're very cute</u>
<u n="12" who="S0416">mm mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0417">do you think anybody keeps them?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0416">erm yeah there are people</u>
<u n="15" who="S0417">they're from China</u>
<u n="16" who="S0416">mm mm in the mountains</u>
<u n="17" who="S0417">eh yeah so do you think they'd need trees though to live on?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0416">yeah I'd get trees</u>
<u n="19" who="S0417">the red panda is territorial it says but it's solitary and they're quiet except for some twittering and tweeting and whistling <unclear/> erm yeah doesn't <unclear/> you'd have to feed it loads of bamboo and things</u>
<u n="20" who="S0416">also it it's erm a carnivorous herbivore or a <trunc>her</trunc></u>
<u n="21" who="S0417">I think carnivorous</u>
<u n="22" who="S0416">carnivorous herbivore</u>
<u n="23" who="S0417">so you'd have to feed it like live mice and things</u>
<u n="24" who="S0416" trans="overlap">cos it eats it eats both it prefers bamboo and berries and things</u>
<u n="25" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0416">but it does eat smaller animals from time to time</u>
<u n="27" who="S0417">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm said some cos the red panda is considered a very attractive animal and not much larger than a house cat it would deem to be ideal for a pet there was reports of <unclear/> keeping red pandas as pets when she was a child <unclear/> probably most of India widespread adoption of these animals as pets has not been reported <pause dur="short"/> so no maybe there's a reason for that</u>
<u n="28" who="S0416">mm mm <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0417">any other pets you might like to keep?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0416">no what about you?</u>

<u n="34" who="S0416">no</u>
<u n="35" who="S0417">why not?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0416">erm I don't think I would like to care for it that long cos I don't I don't think it would be worth all the effort cos horses are cool and all but I don't think it would be cool for that long</u>
<u n="37" who="S0417">mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0416">that's my opinion</u>
<u n="39" who="S0417">yeah but do you like riding horses?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0416">never rode a horse</u>
<u n="41" who="S0417">have you? I'm sure you have maybe you've had a gone on a donkey with me I mean not with me just on your own <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="65" who="S0417">that was a little bit like a Husky well kind of</u>
<u n="66" who="S0416">no</u>
<u n="67" who="S0417">no? not at all?</u>

<u n="70" who="S0416">doesn't mean it's a Husky</u>
<u n="71" who="S0417">I said it just looked like one I didn't say it was one</u>
<u n="72" who="S0416">okay cos Huskies are really big and they kind of look like wolves but</u>
<u n="73" who="S0417">well you know Collies?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0416">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0417">is it is it like a mix of loads of things probably but mostly Collie and Alsatian so it made it a kind of a bit kind of pointed face goldeny fur but quite fluffy fur like a Husky with like quite fluffy and medium sized</u>
<u n="76" who="S0416">mm mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0417">so quite cute really they're very loyal aren't they? dogs</u>

<u n="80" who="S0416">I don't think they're all loyal</u>
<u n="81" who="S0417">no? I thought I thought it was kind of in their nature to be loyal?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0416">I know most dogs but I'm pretty sure there's some breeds of dogs that aren't particularly loyal</u>
<u n="83" who="S0417">really?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0416">I don't know I don't think it's possible that every breed of dog can be loyal</u>
<u n="85" who="S0417">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0416">like every breed of human's not the same every breed of human has different traits</u>
<u n="87" who="S0417">aha</u>

<u n="464" who="S0417">well you <trunc>prob</trunc> you probably just got to get used to just <trunc>pe</trunc>performing in front of other people</u>
<u n="465" who="S0416" trans="overlap">basically basically but it is</u>
<u n="466" who="S0417">but but just don't don't do all the stuff that you need</u>
<u n="467" who="S0416" trans="overlap">but it is for them</u>
<u n="468" who="S0417">yeah</u>

<u n="472" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="473" who="S0416">and we're very mixed very mixed I don't know half the stuff and some people know way more than they should</u>
<u n="474" who="S0417">some people? oh oh <trunc>near</trunc>nearer you <unclear/></u>
<u n="475" who="S0416" trans="overlap">there's this girl that can do there's this girl that can do a double handspin then into a backflip and she does it in the show</u>

<u n="481" who="S0416">yeah but the group is very more much more advanced than me</u>
<u n="482" who="S0417">oh no but I don't think that's a reason not to get stuck in</u>
<u n="483" who="S0416" trans="overlap"><unclear/> why am I in that group?</u>
<u n="484" who="S0417">cos it's boys <pause dur="short"/> cos otherwise you'd be stuck with a load of girls and you can't go to one of the other mixed ones because of time as well <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="485" who="S0416">okay</u>
