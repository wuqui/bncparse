<u n="808" who="S0543">oh no no I'm not saying that I'm just saying that imagine how much money they like if they just got like half the amount of money for like everything not just like how much money they have so that like people who are disadvantaged like half the money across the board</u>
<u n="809" who="S0544">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="810" who="S0542">what if you put in like prices restrictions for like players and things like that?</u>
<u n="811" who="S0543" trans="overlap">then no just literally just take off like half the money for everything like how much they get played how much the club earns then everyone would be at the same like it would be the same just less for everyone</u>
<u n="812" who="S0544">the same but less</u>
<u n="813" who="S0542" trans="overlap">but then you'll have er like smaller teams will like struggle because they can't finance their stuff</u>

<u n="815" who="S0542">would just get halved</u>
<u n="816" who="S0543">everything so that it's like the same it's still the same like in relation</u>
<u n="817" who="S0542" trans="overlap">well then what's the point in that then?</u>
<u n="818" who="S0543">because then what I'm saying is if you get rid of half of that money you could give that money to something that deserves</u>
