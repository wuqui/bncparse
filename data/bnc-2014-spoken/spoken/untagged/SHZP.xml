<u n="8" who="S0267">erm it's going to be a Christmas wedding so it's winter it should be you know the cold side but indoors it'll be warm so I need to take a layer off to be able to be comfortable when I'm inside and I'd gone to the back of my wardrobe and twenty years ago I had this wonderful velvet Laura Ashley coat dress</u>
<u n="9" who="S0266">oh right</u>

<u n="14" who="S0267">velvet beautiful velvet covered erm buttons and satin biased down the front and it was buttoned all the way down and it was erm ankle length ballerina sort of length <pause dur="short"/> and <vocal desc="laugh"/> as I tried it on I couldn't do it up by about five inches in the front <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> so there is no way I'm wearing that</u>
<u n="15" who="S0266">oh</u>
<u n="16" who="S0267" trans="overlap">and I had in the back of my mind that</u>
