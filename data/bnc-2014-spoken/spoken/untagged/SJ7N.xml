<u n="366" who="S0192">pension will be five hundred pound a year?</u>
<u n="367" who="S0227">yeah and er sick pay erm er her sick pay and her pension comes a distant to <unclear>second and third</unclear> to the money that she's obviously lost by not going back to work</u>
<u n="368" who="S0192">why is her pension so low?</u>
<u n="369" who="S0227">er because A she hasn't been in it that much and it's not that that good a pension erm</u>
<u n="370" who="S0192">is this a private pension?</u>
<u n="371" who="S0227">er well no it's er it's a company pension</u>
<u n="372" who="S0192">what's her like state pension?</u>
<u n="373" who="S0227">sorry? that's the state she's got she's gonna get about five hundred pounds a year</u>
<u n="374" who="S0192">that's how much the state thinks you need to live on?</u>
<u n="375" who="S0227">yeah although although she'll well there's two other small pensions cos the she wasn't a final salary which is a good one this is the one I'm <unclear/> referring to but there'll be two other smaller ones that the company her company changed from a final salary pension to this your mum's pension'll be good because it's the same pension as mine the only difference is is the the rate that she's kicking into it and the time that that she's been kicking into it</u>
<u n="376" who="S0192">is it worth paying National Insurance for a pension? cos I'm like a few years out they're telling me that I owe them</u>
<u n="377" who="S0227">yeah well er you</u>
<u n="378" who="S0192">years of National Insurance and I have to pay thirty years to be able to claim <unclear/></u>
<u n="379" who="S0227">yes you need about thirty years to qualify which means the retirement for you isn't gonna be until you're about seventy anyway</u>
<u n="380" who="S0192">so is it worth paying in? or is it just worth <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="381" who="S0227">well</u>
<u n="382" who="S0192">making my own pension</u>
<u n="383" who="S0227">well</u>
<u n="384" who="S0192">and saving my own money and just ignore paying into National Insurance?</u>
<u n="385" who="S0227">this all depends if you're going to live in the UK you're going to get a job and you're gonna pay National Insurance if you like it or not</u>
<u n="386" who="S0192">regardless</u>
<u n="387" who="S0227">but if you're living abroad and you're not intending to come back here then you will won't be entitled to a pension if I move abroad my pension will go abroad to wherever I am cos I've earned it I'm I'm more I'm paid up because er I I've kicked in if you don't contribute then you won't get a pension you won't be entitled</u>
<u n="388" who="S0192">but I mean five hundred pound a year doesn't really seem worth it</u>
<u n="389" who="S0227">no er but that's not her state pension that's her private pension</u>
<u n="390" who="S0192">that's what I was asking you I said er was it a private pension or was it a state pension</u>
<u n="391" who="S0227">no oh it's the oh sorry it's the private pension not the state</u>
<u n="392" who="S0192">how much should she get from the state?</u>
<u n="393" who="S0227">the state will be something like about a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty pound a week</u>
<u n="394" who="S0192">not too bad</u>
<u n="395" who="S0227">no on top of your private pension erm like I said your mum should be okay erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s pension'll be shit cos it's private you've gotta put a shitload of money in and the return is not very good if he'd put and I doubt this very much that he's <trunc>con</trunc> he's he's got a pension pot where he's put about a hundred and twenty thousand into a pension pot that'll buy him a pension of about six thousand pound a year it won't be index-linked I doubt very much that he's saved a hundred and twenty thousand into a pension scheme</u>
<u n="396" who="S0192">no it seems a bit like a con to me</u>
<u n="397" who="S0227">cos</u>
<u n="398" who="S0192">just gonna get older and older before we can even have one and then you probably end up living for about four years on your pension and then you die so you claim out about twenty grand out of the hundred and twenty grand that you put in</u>
<u n="399" who="S0227">well the er the reason they're putting er the argument I don't necessarily believe it is that people will live longer</u>
<u n="400" who="S0192">don't seem to be people seem to be dying left right and centre</u>
<u n="401" who="S0227">er no well they no they don't they don't seem to be at all erm the the er the one at least one in every three people born now will live till above er over a hundred that I don't</u>
<u n="402" who="S0192">that's absolute bullshit</u>
<u n="403" who="S0227">that I don't believe at all</u>

<u n="405" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="406" who="S0192">something like the you know the er average person lives to eighty years and then you think well what about all the people that die before they even get to sixty?</u>
<u n="407" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="408" who="S0192">so are they just not counted in this statistic?</u>

<u n="475" who="S0227">yeah erm this will focus your mind that you know if you stay here you either have will have to contribute for thirty years to get something or you don't factor in that pension and you get a pension by another way by buying a house and then buying a second house that you will then rent out as your source of income</u>
<u n="476" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="477" who="S0227">there's always means and ways as I said private pension I wouldn't apart company ones now are like private pensions and you can opt out but I would imagine if you opt out you won't get any more than the state pension further down the road if er cos they give you pension credit now er which I think is what's? that's a bit absurd er people are paying into a pension and people who aren't paying in are getting pension credit but I would imagine that that'll come to a <trunc>sto</trunc>a stop because they'll be going well you were working and you were given a choice of paying into a private pension you chose not to so therefore you'll get your you've earned your state pension but we're not gonna add you anything on top because you had the choice of a private pension er with with your workplace your workplace pension but you decided to opt out</u>

<u n="484" who="S0227">you don't trust me your <trunc>b</trunc>your brain is erm it's like my brain works different from you two because I'm I'm a parent the chemical process of your brain changes man and woman when you become a <trunc>f</trunc> parent you <trunc>th</trunc>you think differently you'd look at things that you didn't think about and care about before and you now look at em in a different way</u>
<u n="485" who="S0192">why do you think it's pointless <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="486" who="S0189">well I see it as giving money away willingly for someone else to invest and you may or may not get it back I mean I might as well save that money</u>
<u n="487" who="S0192">it's a bit of a gamble isn't it?</u>
<u n="488" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="489" who="S0227">that is the trouble</u>
<u n="490" who="S0189">invest it myself <unclear>and then</unclear></u>
<u n="491" who="S0227">that er that is the problem with a with a private pension er yeah with mine because mine's a final salary er I can work out almost to the pound how much I'll get every month <unclear/> I've got a little erm <unclear>macro</unclear></u>
<u n="492" who="S0192">and it's completely safe?</u>
<u n="493" who="S0227">I put it's it's copper-<trunc>l</trunc> it's it's gold-plated the only reason that wouldn't become safe is there there's a <trunc>w</trunc> there's been a nuclear war</u>
<u n="494" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="495" who="S0227">apart from that it it's copper-lined yeah er I wouldn't transfer it into a tin pot pale comparison er pension it's not the best pension out there there are better pensions but it's a bloody good one compared to private</u>
<u n="496" who="S0189">if I had the option of paying into a pension now in fact I did in my job</u>

<u n="503" who="S0227"><unclear/></u>
<u n="504" who="S0189">oh a couple of percent</u>
<u n="505" who="S0227">you know it's erm something er that I would consider by thirty you don't really need need <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s got more <unclear/></u>
<u n="506" who="S0189">thirty yeah</u>
<u n="507" who="S0227">thirty for you is not that far away</u>
<u n="508" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="509" who="S0227">for him it's still he's still closer he's still closer to twenty than thirty you're clearly not and in a few weeks' time I will be closer to sixty than fifty what a what a horrifying thought</u>

<u n="511" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="512" who="S0192">how does it work then? how does a private pension work? I give em the money</u>
<u n="513" who="S0227">you buy an <trunc>annui</trunc></u>
<u n="514" who="S0192">and then</u>
<u n="515" who="S0227">you buy an annuity</u>
<u n="516" who="S0192">they add more money to it because they use the money to invest <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="517" who="S0227">they <trunc>th</trunc>they put it on <trunc>s</trunc> they put it they take their cut that's why you don't want to keep changing pension companies because every time you do this they take a cut admin fees and all that rubbish erm what they do is they invest it on the stock exchange they probably have <trunc>w</trunc> they have and what's known as a portfolio they'll put some stuff in high risk medium risk and low risk and then you get an average of returns some will lose some will gain some will do nothing so it erm that is how it <unclear/></u>
<u n="518" who="S0192">they're actually gambling on your savings for your future?</u>
<u n="519" who="S0227">yeah yes exactly yeah they're not losing erm erm</u>
<u n="520" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="521" who="S0227">and erm so they can't give you a figure apart from er a final settlement figure as to a projection because they don't know what the stock <trunc>e</trunc> <trunc>mar</trunc> <trunc>ex</trunc> market's gonna be doing so what happens is then is that you buy an annuity that annuity enables you to er a company will then erm take your money and they will then give you a yearly pension for the rest of your life but unlike mine yours won't be index-linked so say for argument's sake you got six a six thousand pound pension in twenty years' time it'd still be six grand it wouldn't have gone up with inflation mine will if I ever gave your mother some good advice I said to her when she was was still with me erm with the <trunc>par</trunc> working part-time for the council get on the pension and she did she followed that advice <vocal desc="laugh"/> that was good advice I gave her because that's now added to her <trunc>s</trunc> length of service otherwise it wouldn't have been it would've been when she got her job properly full-time dah dah dah it would've started running then so I thought to myself at the time get into this pension cos er I'm in it if we're both in it you you know life'll be easier</u>
<u n="522" who="S0192">yeah I guess come thirty I'm gonna have to start thinking about that</u>

<u n="763" who="S0192">in Korea I just used a bag of dried lemon grass it worked fine I had to steep it in a cup kinda like tea</u>

<u n="776" who="S0227">and then I just drop the ice cubes into the erm but you'd have to <trunc>bl</trunc> <trunc>bl</trunc> either use a blender which you probably haven't got or a knife to cut it up quite fine</u>
