<u n="873" who="S0197">and then if you get three of each that's different ones that's the joker so that captures anything so if you get a er infantry cavalry artillery then you get ten extra goes at the beginning of your go</u>
<u n="874" who="S0192">oh</u>
<u n="875" who="S0199" trans="overlap">I'm going to attack Eastern United States</u>

<u n="892" who="S0199">look I'm going to war</u>
<u n="893" who="S0197">but you can't attack somebody that's got two on there as well it's a bit more complicated but go on then but you can't attack there cos it's not joining</u>
<u n="894" who="S0192">that's the simplest rule we'll stick with that one first shall we?</u>
<u n="895" who="S0199">what?</u>
<u n="896" who="S0192" trans="overlap">you've got to attack joining then</u>

<u n="907" who="S0199">no no I'd have to have two</u>

<u n="909" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="910" who="S0197">if you're attacking</u>

<u n="4921" who="S0192">when you have a an MA it drops again</u>

<u n="4923" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and then when you have a a PhD it drops massively again</u>

<u n="4926" who="S0199">yeah yeah I can believe that</u>
<u n="4927" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it seems that if you pursue education you don't tend to do it</u>
<u n="4928" who="S0199" trans="overlap">well you've gone the edge er you've gone the academic route as opposed to the family <pause dur="short"/> family route <pause dur="short"/> haven't you?</u>
<u n="4929" who="S0192">but maybe it's as you become because you've postponed it a bit you start to develop these ideas of what a child should have a what a child a kind of environment that a child should be brought up in and then you start to look at yourself and think I can't provide that</u>
<u n="4930" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4931" who="S0192">I can't do that and therefore how can I do that? I guess a big part of why I don't want children is because if I were to have a children I'd wanna give it everything and I want <trunc>y</trunc> it to have the perfect everything <pause dur="short"/> if it makes sense</u>
<u n="4932" who="S0199" trans="overlap">what is the perfect everything?</u>

<u n="4934" who="S0199" trans="overlap">and what is giving them everything?</u>
<u n="4935" who="S0192">well I think a parent should be erm I think a parent should be educated enough to be able to teach their child important things simple things I think a parent should know how to cook quite well and I think a parent should know how to manage money very well and in and be social and and er numerous attributes like er loads of things that <pause dur="short"/> I mean most people kind of develop as they go on through the having children maybe they didn't have it quite right on their first child but they're better on their second child that kind of thing</u>
<u n="4936" who="S0199" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="4937" who="S0192">I guess I see those attributes and think oh I should have X amount of money in the bank before I have a child</u>
<u n="4938" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4939" who="S0192">and I think I should be able to provide it for these things and if it wants to go on a school trip I can afford for it to go on a school trip</u>
<u n="4940" who="S0199" trans="overlap">mm okay</u>
<u n="4941" who="S0192">and these kind of things do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="4942" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4943" who="S0192">there's a whole a whole plethora of attributes that I feel are necessary before you have a child I mean I'm of such a a liberal mindset that I actually personally would change the whole structure</u>
<u n="4944" who="S0199">I know you would yeah you've told me before</u>
<u n="4945" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I don't think that children should spend most of their time with other children which is basically how most children are nowadays in society they spend the majority of their time learning from other children but what can other children teach them apart from how to interact with other children? they should be spending most of their time with adults and then they should also be spending most of their time not just with a couple of adults but with a wide variety of adults that are able to teach them</u>
<u n="4946" who="S0199" trans="overlap">but isn't that what a family is? aunts and uncles and</u>
<u n="4947" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah you need a good family network so then again I look at my own life and think well you know I don't have a good family network I don't have</u>
<u n="4948" who="S0199">well you</u>
<u n="4949" who="S0192" trans="overlap">a lot of people around I mean er the only way it would work is what? if I came and lived down the road from you</u>
<u n="4950" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4951" who="S0192">because then you'd be there and you'd be able to help out so if I don't have that network around me</u>
<u n="4952" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4953" who="S0192">and I don't have these other adults I mean it probably sounds crazy but I personally think we should <trunc>a</trunc> we should all be euthanised euthanised sorry we should all be sterilised and you should apply to have children and you should meet X amount of criteria before you have a child and then that child probably should effectively I mean I don't see why we don't have systems for having children if you need to apply for a driving licence and you need to apply <trunc>t</trunc> it's a massive criteria to adopt it takes years to be able to adopt but yet you can just pump out a child no worries with no nobody evaluating you in any sense whatsoever that to me is is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous and the only reason it exists is because it's that easy to have a child so</u>
<u n="4954" who="S0199" trans="overlap">but also it's freedom isn't it? otherwise you're going back to China and er places like that where they you er er have they have rules that you can only have isn't it? isn't it that you can only have</u>
<u n="4955" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I mean that wasn't as it was a rule but the only rule that really existed the only way that they enforced that rule was that they said if you have more than one child</u>
<u n="4956" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4957" who="S0192">you have to pay for everything for that child</u>
<u n="4958" who="S0199" trans="overlap">oh right okay</u>
<u n="4959" who="S0192">that was how they did it</u>
<u n="4960" who="S0199">yeah</u>
<u n="4961" who="S0192">they didn't say you can't have a child they just said you can only have one child that the state will pay for</u>
<u n="4962" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4963" who="S0192">if you want another child</u>
<u n="4964" who="S0199" trans="overlap">which was fair enough really</u>
<u n="4965" who="S0192" trans="overlap">you need to be yeah I mean I don't have I don't see a problem with that</u>
<u n="4966" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4967" who="S0192">the problem is that you then get mm all sorts of negative effects where they're leaving dead babies in the side of streets</u>
<u n="4968" who="S0199">oh my god</u>
<u n="4969" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and all this kind of stuff and in because of Chinese society the male carries on the family name they don't want females and all this kind of stuff so it's like</u>

<u n="4971" who="S0192">so it you need a whole social construct reformed for that a system like that to work but I'm not against that I think that's how it should be and quite often and I'm not talking about you or or people in our family but there are a hell of a lot of people that are having children that probably shouldn't be</u>

<u n="4979" who="S0192" trans="overlap">like in a in the future nobody has children children are created and they're created without defect genes without all this kind of stuff</u>
<u n="4980" who="S0199" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was talking about this the other</u>

<u n="4984" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4985" who="S0192">you know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I maybe could consider the prospect of having a child a lot more if it was for five years or something if we were okay we're gonna have a child for five years and then we'll teach everything we can to that child for five years and look after it and we'll have a bond with it and then it'll move on to someone else now we don't forget the child we still have some role to play within the child's life but it it's not living with us you know what I mean? er and then you can also control how many children we're having and like the population doesn't need to keep growing and keep getting bigger</u>

<u n="4987" who="S0192">and when we don't have a <trunc>fi</trunc> we have a finite amount of resources and and the whole system to me and if I think this how can I have a child?</u>
<u n="4988" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4989" who="S0192">I've said to you before I don't agree with education er how it is how can I give my child up to the state</u>
<u n="4990" who="S0199">mm</u>
<u n="4991" who="S0192">in four years in and then just say alright it's up to you to educate my child? even though I'm a teacher and I'm educated and I'm qualified to impart my wisdom on my children</u>
<u n="4992" who="S0199" trans="overlap">well you have another option there don't you? you you teach them yourself you take them out of school and you teach them yourself</u>

<u n="5015" who="S0192">oh definitely and you've always got this thing as well that every person that's had a child is gonna look down on you and go you just don't know cos you haven't had a child and that I find frustrating</u>
<u n="5016" who="S0199" trans="overlap">why would that bother you?</u>
<u n="5017" who="S0192">it bothers me because it's like saying I can't possibly have any idea of what it's like to drive a car just cos I've never driven one but I've been in cars all the time and I've been around people that drive cars I've spoken to people that drive cars I've watched people drive cars and there's a fairly simple mechanic to driving a car</u>

<u n="5022" who="S0199">mm it's kind of like wait till you have your own then you'll understand</u>
