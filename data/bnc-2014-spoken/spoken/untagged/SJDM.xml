<u n="1" who="S0017">why does it show?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0018">so <trunc>h</trunc> how much is your insurance?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0017">it would be without the discount about seven hundred and fifty</u>
<u n="4" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> between the two of you?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0017">no each</u>
<u n="6" who="S0019">no each</u>
<u n="7" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="8" who="S0017">Cos each of us has the other as a nominated second driver</u>
<u n="9" who="S0018">oh is that  is that  why it costs more?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0017"><trunc>D</trunc> it shouldn't be much more for that for us because of the length and because it's only occasional use <pause dur="short"/> each of us for the other car</u>
<u n="11" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="12" who="S0017">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but um</u>
<u n="13" who="S0019"><vocal desc="cough"/> Yours would be more but it wouldn't be as much as if you were a young you know sort of eighteen nineteen year old <pause dur="short"/> um your age will tend to lower their premiums a bit</u>
<u n="14" who="S0018">even though I've got no experience?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> if you are a newly qualified driver of what? Seventeen eighteen <pause dur="short"/> although women's tends to be lower than men's but they've</u>
<u n="16" who="S0017">it has been <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0019">bought this equalisation thing</u>
<u n="18" who="S0017">but you could be paying two thousand four thousand pounds</u>
<u n="19" who="S0019" trans="overlap">two thousand</u>
<u n="20" who="S0018">how much?</u>
<u n="21" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> for one year</u>
<u n="22" who="S0018" trans="overlap">for one person for one year?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0017">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="24" who="S0019">mm hm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0018"><trunc>B</trunc> em</u>
<u n="26" who="S0019">as you are much older than that yours won't be as high</u>
<u n="27" who="S0017">the risk factor is in young people</u>
<u n="28" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0017">starting to drive</u>
<u n="30" who="S0019">they are more likely to have accidents</u>
<u n="31" who="S0018">so I doubt whether yours would be anything like that much</u>
<u n="32" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> yes I guess they've got they might have less life experience so that might make them more prone to accidents but <pause dur="short"/> I think a twenty year old brain is so</u>
<u n="33" who="S0019">not at all</u>
<u n="34" who="S0018">it assimilates new things a lot more quickly and</u>
<u n="35" who="S0019">not at all</u>
<u n="36" who="S0018">no <pause dur="short"/> no I think it's true</u>
<u n="37" who="S0017">yes but it that it tends to build confidence where confidence isn't justified</u>
<u n="38" who="S0018">true <pause dur="short"/> true <pause dur="short"/> but I think you get used to things a lot more quickly?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0019">yes but you tend to be a bit more reckless</u>
<u n="40" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0019">young males particularly</u>
<u n="42" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0019">the number of young males who have a an accident within the first twelve months of getting their license is fairly considerable <pause dur="short"/> not so great for women <pause dur="short"/> cos I think majority of women tend to be a bit more cautious</u>
<u n="44" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0019">but boys certainly don't</u>
<u n="46" who="S0018">so why did they <trunc>con</trunc> why didn't they continue to let women pay less insurance?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0019">because of a silly EU directive</u>
<u n="48" who="S0017">em equality</u>
<u n="49" who="S0018">but you could argue the equality case for anything <pause dur="short"/> surely like</u>
<u n="50" who="S0017">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's why it's stupid</u>
<u n="51" who="S0018">that's ageist to charge me more money on a bus just because you know my grandmother could only pays seventy-five P that's ageist <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="52" who="S0017">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0019">no it it is a ridiculous thing</u>
<u n="54" who="S0017">when insurance has always been based on statistical probabilities</u>
<u n="55" who="S0018">huh <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="56" who="S0017">the level of risk</u>
<u n="57" who="S0018">yup</u>
<u n="58" who="S0017">and age is acknowledged as being a significant additional risk <pause dur="short"/> but and up till now</u>
<u n="59" who="S0018">youth</u>
<u n="60" who="S0017">women's risk rate has been lower than young women's been lower than men's but they are now saying that you can't make that discrimination anymore which is shows how ludicrous discriminatory laws become</u>
<u n="61" who="S0019">absolutely it's ridiculous</u>
<u n="62" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so age or youth is more of a risk than lack of experience?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0017">I think there's a</u>
<u n="64" who="S0019">well there's a correlation</u>
<u n="65" who="S0017" trans="overlap">they probably go together on a graph and it becomes a point where um your inexperience um has less effect than your age</u>
<u n="66" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0019">it's the old saying a lot of familiarity breeds contempt <pause dur="short"/> that a lot of young drivers are so supremely confident in their own ability that it leads them to reckless driving <pause dur="short"/> and that's what gets them into most of the problems</u>
<u n="68" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> yes I think I'll be super safety-conscious all the time <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="69" who="S0017" trans="overlap">and the young ones are rather more to imbibing</u>
<u n="70" who="S0019">yes</u>
<u n="71" who="S0017">um reckless quantities of red wine <pause dur="short"/> um which I'm sure you've grown out of</u>
<u n="72" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="73" who="S0019">no <pause dur="short"/> it it it is a stupid ruling and it's come out of the EU as of most of stupid rulings do and it's ludicrous</u>
<u n="74" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0019">but no you'll be  you'll be  fine</u>
<u n="76" who="S0017">I'm amazed the insurers and politicians didn't fight it much more strongly</u>
<u n="77" who="S0018">well I guess the insurers don't care because what they lose on the male's paying they'll just add to the female's bills</u>
<u n="78" who="S0019">but it won't mean the males will pay any less it just means that females will pay the same</u>
<u n="79" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="80" who="S0019">uh-huh</u>
<u n="81" who="S0018">oh they were probably laughing all the way to the bank then that's probably why they didn't fight it</u>
<u n="82" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah <trunc>d</trunc> there's no reduction for the men's charge <pause dur="short"/> it just means that the women's goes up</u>
<u n="83" who="S0017">we don't know if that's the truth</u>
<u n="84" who="S0019" trans="overlap">to match the men's <pause dur="short"/> we do <pause dur="short"/> well we'll see <pause dur="short"/> but no <trunc>t</trunc> there's no way of telling and I <pause dur="short"/> you have to shop around as well for insurance</u>
<u n="85" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0019">you have to get you know as many sort of quotes you can possibly get because some are more expensive than others</u>
<u n="87" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0019">and it very much depends I suppose on what sort of car you have as well <pause dur="short"/> you want to get a car that's in the lowest insurance band</u>
<u n="89" who="S0018">what kind of car would that be?</u>
<u n="90" who="S0017">it's eh not a specific kind in terms of make but eh not anything that is high performance not anything that is modified to perform better <pause dur="short"/> so it would be in general the basic models in most ranges and the smaller car's the better</u>
<u n="91" who="S0019">the smaller engine capacity um tend to be the best ones <pause dur="short"/> does do emissions have any bearing on insurance?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0017">no</u>
<u n="93" who="S0019">no?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0017">no</u>
<u n="95" who="S0018">that's road tax is it?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so you want to go for one that has the lowest emissions and lowest engine capacity</u>
<u n="97" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0019">to get the cheapest outcome</u>
<u n="99" who="S0018">and what was it I heard about there's some kind of little black box that's being installed into cars that tracks <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what it tracks but then that informs the insurance company of how much to charge you or something?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0017">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0019">it records the moments before any accident or anything</u>
<u n="102" who="S0017">no it's more than that <pause dur="short"/> it's actually recording</u>
<u n="103" who="S0019">all the times is it?</u>
<u n="104" who="S0017">the types the driving style <pause dur="short"/> I don't know whether it's sampling or recording a hundred percent of the time but um and the amount of hours driving and the distance driven</u>
<u n="105" who="S0019">but if you have one of these in the car it pushes your <trunc>insu</trunc> your insurance premiums down</u>
<u n="106" who="S0017">but we I pay less <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember what mileage we've set for yours but mine is based on nine thousand miles a year <pause dur="short"/> your mother's is based on I forgot it no idea maybe five thousand miles a year</u>
<u n="107" who="S0019">sounds about right</u>
<u n="108" who="S0017">em and we get a reduction for that? Sorry are you picking that up on the recording?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0018">for for only going  for only going  a certain distance?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0019">well if you for the sake of argument you were working in Oxford and you had a car <pause dur="short"/> you'd probably find it more cost-effective to use public transport to get there and back because of the petrol consumption parking charges <pause dur="short"/> cos if you work at a place that provides parking spaces then you get done in tax cos that's taxable <pause dur="short"/> it's considered a perk <pause dur="short"/> so they tax you on it</u>
<u n="113" who="S0018">if you don't pay for parking?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0019">no if you do pay for <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> if you don't if you're if you have a parking space provided at your place of work they do you <pause dur="short"/> they charge you extra tax</u>
<u n="115" who="S0018">on what?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0017">it's a taxable benefit so that's <unclear/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0018">yeah I know but what do they pay you on? What do they charge you tax on?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0017">on a notional value of the parking space</u>
<u n="119" who="S0018"><trunc>B</trunc> when do you end up paying that with your road tax?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0017" trans="overlap">it's in your <pause dur="short"/> no it's in your  in your  employment tax</u>
<u n="121" who="S0018">how stupid</u>
<u n="122" who="S0019"><vocal desc="laugh"/> mm hm <pause dur="short"/> the only time when you would find having a car useful is in um when it's chucking it down with rain or it's absolutely freezing cold</u>
<u n="123" who="S0018">so most of the year?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0019">no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="125" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0019">no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> that's not right at all and you know it <pause dur="short"/> um you just have to go see what the costs are and the problem is of course that once you've got a car you are tempted to use it all the time</u>
<u n="127" who="S0018">well I'm not going to buy one just to keep it in the garage</u>
<u n="128" who="S0019"><vocal desc="laugh"/> You'll be lucky if you get a garage ducks <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="129" who="S0018">well whether I have a car or not at least I'm using this time</u>
<u n="130" who="S0019">mm hm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0018">to learn how to drive</u>
<u n="132" who="S0019">exactly <pause dur="short"/> you know it's something that you you really needed to do</u>
<u n="133" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="134" who="S0019">so</u>
<u n="135" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's just difficult to mentalize all the different processes going on at the same time and wonder how long it's gonna take for that to become</u>
<u n="136" who="S0019">it won't take you long</u>
<u n="137" who="S0018">automatic</u>
<u n="138" who="S0019">it won't take you long <pause dur="short"/> I would say probably at the end of three lessons you'll be doing without even thinking about it</u>
<u n="139" who="S0018">you think so?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0019">mm hm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0018">was that was it like that for you?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0019">I only had ten lessons</u>
<u n="143" who="S0018">oooh</u>
<u n="144" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="145" who="S0018">but did did you go out practicing?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0019">no</u>
<u n="147" who="S0018">no?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0019">oh I'm sorry I drove to <anon type="place"/> swimming baths once a week <pause dur="short"/> and that's it <pause dur="short"/> because a certain person sitting next to me is an absolutely rotten passenger when you are trying to learn to drive <pause dur="short"/> there is the famous example after I had passed my test <pause dur="short"/> we were on this caravan site in Wales <pause dur="short"/> a big wide road</u>
<u n="149" who="S0017">in Wales?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0019">yes it was South Wales</u>
<u n="151" who="S0017">we've never been</u>
<u n="152" who="S0019">yes we have</u>
<u n="153" who="S0017">oh it wasn't <anon type="place"/> it was down in Devon</u>
<u n="154" who="S0019">no it wasn't <pause dur="short"/> it was <anon type="place"/> we had a Triumph Help and there was big concrete islands and I was driving up to this perfectly normally at a reasonable speed</u>
<u n="155" who="S0017">about to run over a man in sandals</u>
<u n="156" who="S0019" trans="overlap">and suddenly your father shouts clutch and brake <pause dur="short"/> clutch and brake <pause dur="short"/> frightened the living daylights out of me</u>
<u n="157" who="S0018">what was he saying?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0019">clutch and brake</u>
<u n="159" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="160" who="S0019">so I stopped the car and I said if you want to drive drive <pause dur="short"/> if not shut up <pause dur="short"/> But he's a terrible passenger <pause dur="short"/> I do not advise you under any circumstances to go out with him sitting next to you</u>
<u n="161" who="S0018">I thought maybe he'd be quite good?</u>
<u n="162" who="S0017">I am really</u>
<u n="163" who="S0018"><trunc>W</trunc> what and this is said after the the sailboat incident where he was trying to teach me how to change direction</u>
<u n="164" who="S0019">yes</u>
<u n="165" who="S0018">and said he'd give me one set of instructions <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="166" who="S0019">yes</u>
<u n="167" who="S0018">and then when he actually came to it he said something completely different <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="168" who="S0019">yes</u>
<u n="169" who="S0017">it's intuitive</u>
<u n="170" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="171" who="S0019">it's it's like him trying to teach me how to use the computer <pause dur="short"/> instead of sticking</u>
<u n="172" who="S0018">yes</u>
<u n="173" who="S0019">to the basics</u>
<u n="174" who="S0018">trying being the operative word <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0019">instead of sticking to the basics only the things I need to know he starts saying um and then if you want to do this you press this that and then when you want to do that you press that and I'm thinking hello? I haven't got the slightest idea what you're talking about <pause dur="short"/> And then he gets ratty when I don't understand and I was just saying to you the other day wasn't I? Shades of granddad and maths</u>
<u n="176" who="S0017">mm</u>
<u n="177" who="S0019">this is exactly the same reaction</u>
<u n="178" who="S0018">I can remember you doing that to me when we were doing maths</u>
<u n="179" who="S0019">mm hm</u>
<u n="180" who="S0018">okay so to be able to understand how to do this you need to understand how to do that <pause dur="short"/> and I was like no we've already done that and we need to do this and I need to do it in twenty minutes because I've got something on TV <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="181" who="S0017"><trunc>T</trunc> that's a big problem with schooling that each generation does these things in a different way</u>
<u n="182" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's true</u>
<u n="183" who="S0017">um</u>
<u n="184" who="S0019">that's true</u>
<u n="185" who="S0017">so ideally with any problem you never start from here</u>
<u n="186" who="S0019">no it always ended up in tears if granddad tried to teach me anything in maths <pause dur="short"/> because it for him he could understand it just like that and couldn't understand why I couldn't <pause dur="short"/> so he'd explain it and I couldn't do it <pause dur="short"/> so he'd explain it again in exactly the same way and I still couldn't do it <pause dur="short"/> then he started getting ratty <pause dur="short"/> and it was not a good situation <pause dur="short"/> it always ended up in tears <pause dur="short"/> so and he engenders the same feelings <pause dur="short"/> so just stick with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> and your driving instructor <pause dur="short"/> did he say roughly how many lessons people tend to have?</u>
<u n="187" who="S0018">he said <trunc>pe</trunc> everyone asks him</u>
<u n="188" who="S0019">can't tell</u>
<u n="189" who="S0018">and he can never answer but um <pause dur="short"/> I think if I pay for ten and probably have another ten after</u>
<u n="190" who="S0019">see how you get on</u>
<u n="191" who="S0018">yeah but I mean if I'm not going to go out practicing <pause dur="short"/> I think I prefer to have twenty lessons</u>
<u n="192" who="S0017">mm <pause dur="short"/> well he will say</u>
<u n="193" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="194" who="S0017">if he thinks after ten lessons that you're ready to take you test or he'll say you need a couple more lessons before taking your test <pause dur="short"/> so so you can judge it then</u>
<u n="195" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> you got a theory test to do as well now haven't you?</u>
<u n="196" who="S0017">yes you do <pause dur="short"/> the theory test before you can apply for your</u>
<u n="197" who="S0019">yep</u>
<u n="198" who="S0017">main test</u>
<u n="199" who="S0018">but you can do practice ones on</u>
<u n="200" who="S0017">did he mention anything about a theory test?</u>
<u n="201" who="S0018">nope</u>
<u n="202" who="S0017">yeah</u>
<u n="203" who="S0019">you can do practice ones on the computer as well</u>
<u n="204" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="205" who="S0019">so</u>
<u n="206" who="S0018">well it's good that you can actually learn how to drive before you pass your theory test <pause dur="short"/> because in Spain you have to pass your theory test before you can get behind the wheel of a car</u>
<u n="207" who="S0019">really?</u>
<u n="208" who="S0018">yeah which is what put me off doing it for so long <pause dur="short"/> because you can't even learn how to drive until you've you've already signed up paid all your thousands of Euros and done the theory part of the test <pause dur="short"/> and you have to learn out about how the car works as well all the mechanics</u>
<u n="209" who="S0019">really? Oh crikey if that had been me that would have been I'd never learn to drive <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Depends on how deeply they go into the mechanics</u>
<u n="210" who="S0018">well it just always put me off</u>
<u n="211" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I can understand why</u>
<u n="212" who="S0018">I probably would have jumped in a car and learnt how to drive before if had I not had to</u>
<u n="213" who="S0019">I didn't realise it was quite as onerous as that in Spain</u>
<u n="214" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="215" who="S0019">and yet their standard of driving is so abysmal <vocal desc="laugh"/> So</u>
<u n="216" who="S0018">is it?</u>
<u n="217" who="S0019">oh yes</u>
<u n="218" who="S0018">do you notice it? Really?</u>
<u n="219" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="220" who="S0018">I'd say more the <trunc>r</trunc> roads <pause dur="short"/> I'd I'd definitely say the roads are laid out in a less logical way and a more dangerous way but</u>
<u n="221" who="S0017">I think that is it's difficult really to make that assessment because the driving that you tend to do when you're abroad is not typical of the driving you'd be doing at home <pause dur="short"/> cos you'd be travelling somewhere unfamiliar on time</u>
<u n="222" who="S0018">no but when I was in Spain around</u>
<u n="223" who="S0017">I'm talking about us <pause dur="short"/> your mother's</u>
<u n="224" who="S0018">oh right to compare</u>
<u n="225" who="S0017">your mother's  comparing <pause dur="short"/> but the worst driving we saw was in France</u>
<u n="226" who="S0019">oh that was</u>
<u n="227" who="S0017">when we drove down to</u>
<u n="228" who="S0019">dire absolutely dire <pause dur="short"/> mind you there's a lot of driving in this country that is appalling</u>
<u n="229" who="S0017">mm <pause dur="short"/> but we I <trunc>d</trunc> don't think we saw as many patently reckless incidences of people going at massive</u>
<u n="230" who="S0019">no probably not</u>
<u n="231" who="S0017">speeds in inappropriate conditions</u>
<u n="232" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> I think that driving in France made me a lot more nervous than driving in Spain</u>
<u n="233" who="S0017">mm</u>
<u n="234" who="S0019">but more nervous than here <pause dur="short"/> but then that maybe just cos I'm used to it here</u>
<u n="235" who="S0018">why?</u>
<u n="236" who="S0017">oh love <pause dur="short"/> you don't like driving beyond your four mile radius of here <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="237" who="S0019">now that's not true <pause dur="short"/> it's alright as long as I can do a recce first and find out exactly where I'm going <pause dur="short"/> I can't cope with not knowing where I'm going and having to drive as well</u>
<u n="238" who="S0017">okay</u>
<u n="239" who="S0019">that's my major problem</u>
<u n="240" who="S0018">what is it about the way they drive in France that makes you less confident?</u>
<u n="241" who="S0019">they were driving much faster than the conditions dictated and doing pulling out and passing in in the most ridiculous places <pause dur="short"/> it was urgh frightening</u>
<u n="242" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="243" who="S0019">really frightening <pause dur="short"/> actually that's going back a long way as well isn't it?</u>
<u n="244" who="S0017">no it's not that many years <pause dur="short"/> it's in the last</u>
<u n="245" who="S0018">oh you mean when you went to France the last time?</u>
<u n="246" who="S0017">no <pause dur="short"/> the time we went and stayed near who's your wine merchant?</u>

<u n="253" who="S0019" trans="overlap">that was about five years ago? Six years ago? Something like that</u>
<u n="254" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="255" who="S0017">they just discovered today in making the booking for going to Paxos <pause dur="short"/> that it was two thousand and three the last time we went when we went to Kefalonia and we had the villa for a week and the yacht for a  and the yacht for a  week <pause dur="short"/> can you see the the levels?</u>

<u n="257" who="S0018">how come?</u>
<u n="258" who="S0019">because they consider that a loyalty reward</u>
<u n="259" who="S0018">ah</u>
<u n="260" who="S0019">even though it was along nearly ten years ago</u>
<u n="261" who="S0017">yes</u>

<u n="313" who="S0019">and I was back um you'd set off in the morning to sail back and I was back about the same time as you <pause dur="short"/> so it really was a a quick and quite comfortable journey <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't bad at all <pause dur="short"/> where was it that we got picked up in that speed boat?</u>
<u n="314" who="S0017">that was to go from Corfu to Paxos</u>

<u n="319" who="S0019">that's right <pause dur="short"/> yep that's right <pause dur="short"/> that was quite exciting wasn't it?</u>
<u n="320" who="S0017">yes</u>
<u n="321" who="S0019">A bit hard on the back cos it sort of bumped just like you driving <unclear/> speed <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh that was fun</u>

<u n="337" who="S0018">why did you decide to go to Paxos?</u>
<u n="338" who="S0019">we liked Paxos didn't we?</u>
<u n="339" who="S0017">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's eh to some extent in desperation at deciding on somewhere <pause dur="short"/> if you go somewhere different you don't know what to experience <pause dur="short"/> we've been to Paxos a couple of times um <pause dur="short"/> so we have a good idea what it's going to be like <pause dur="short"/> and it's</u>
<u n="340" who="S0019">and the time of year there will still be a lot of the flowers and it will still be quite green</u>
<u n="341" who="S0018">is it quite pretty?</u>
<u n="342" who="S0019">yes in a</u>
<u n="343" who="S0017">yes it is</u>
<u n="344" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it is in a quaint sort of way</u>
<u n="345" who="S0017">mm</u>
<u n="346" who="S0019">it's very different to what we call pretty here</u>
<u n="347" who="S0017">there are a lot of olive groves so you've got sort of rocky soil with olive trees in and then but also there are a fair amount of other greenery and shrubbery</u>
<u n="348" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> no it's it's very pleasant and we we walked didn't we? To Logos?</u>
<u n="349" who="S0017">I'm not so sure we didn't walk to  on one occasion</u>
<u n="350" who="S0019">no we didn't walk to  that was too far <pause dur="short"/> we did walk to Logos and it takes you up all over the hill and it's very very pretty</u>

<u n="355" who="S0019">two three miles?</u>
<u n="356" who="S0017">yeah</u>

<u n="358" who="S0017">mm hm</u>
<u n="359" who="S0019">they've still got the the some of the pretty spring flowers <pause dur="short"/> um I must say it was very green cos later on in the season it isn't <pause dur="short"/> it's like a lot of places it's brown <pause dur="short"/> but eh no very nice and there are little villages loads of flowers and plants in pots in window boxes and things like that very pretty</u>
<u n="360" who="S0017">and Paxos is a low tourist resort not a not like Corfu which is overwhelmed with tourists</u>
<u n="361" who="S0017">mm</u>
<u n="362" who="S0019">oh Corfu was vile the last time we went there wasn't much Greek left there</u>

<u n="364" who="S0019">it was just a giant tourist island <pause dur="short"/> it was <pause dur="short"/> not nice</u>

<u n="368" who="S0018">when were you not worried about the Greek situation?</u>
<u n="369" who="S0017">I was concerned but bearing in mind we're flying with um <pause dur="short"/> it will be Thompson or I can't remember if it was Thomas Cook or Thompson</u>
<u n="370" who="S0019">one of the two</u>
<u n="371" who="S0017">um and you're not actually going on to the Greek mainland so if there are air traffic it's less likely to be air traffic than ground staff can problems aside</u>
<u n="372" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="373" who="S0017">I think Paxos and the other islands are less at risk than the mainland airports <pause dur="short"/> I may be wrong but</u>
<u n="374" who="S0018">oh were you worried about it for strike action?</u>
<u n="375" who="S0017">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="376" who="S0018">oh they'll probably do just do what Spain did <pause dur="short"/> and when the air traffic controllers went on strike they just got the army in <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="378" who="S0019">yep</u>
<u n="379" who="S0018">keep the <trunc>touris</trunc> because <trunc>G</trunc> Greece is pretty much relying on tourism now no for?</u>

<u n="381" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's right <pause dur="short"/> so I think they would be extremely silly to do anything like that but eh with the rioting that's been <pause dur="short"/> although there was a letter in the paper the travel section of the Telegraph that said somebody had been to Athens where there was supposedly</u>
<u n="382" who="S0017">oh yeah</u>
<u n="383" who="S0019">all these riots and they said there was really very little <pause dur="short"/> so you don't know who to believe do you?</u>

<u n="388" who="S0018">it's going to happen in specific places at specific times that</u>

<u n="390" who="S0018">well if it's a riot for a couple of hours it's a riot isn't it?</u>
<u n="391" who="S0019">it is but it doesn't seem</u>
<u n="392" who="S0018">but you never know what whether to trust the newspaper because they're reporting it out of proportion or they're reporting it less because they don't want people to think that the situation is as important or as critical as it is <pause dur="short"/> it's you never trust</u>

<u n="419" who="S0018">super</u>
<u n="420" who="S0019">so we don't quite know what the position of the cats will be</u>
<u n="421" who="S0018">let's see how things turn out</u>
<u n="422" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="423" who="S0018"><trunc>Wha</trunc> what's going on?</u>
<u n="424" who="S0019">mm hm</u>
<u n="425" who="S0018">but I'm sure that I mean if <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> or or if <trunc>who</trunc> or whichever neighbour is coming in to deal with yours that they could somehow deal with mine if we need to</u>
<u n="426" who="S0019">I <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't like to ask <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to deal with yours as well as ours</u>
<u n="427" who="S0018">why?</u>
<u n="428" who="S0019">because we've got to work out how we deal with yours because we can't leave them out all the time with the food out</u>
<u n="429" who="S0017" trans="overlap">I I don't think that is yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think the bigger problem is the cat flap <pause dur="short"/> that yours will eventually find out how to get outside</u>
<u n="430" who="S0018">oh I don't think that's a problem because one one cat can't get through the cat flap cos it's too fat</u>
<u n="431" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="432" who="S0017">he it might block it and none of them can get back in <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="433" who="S0018">and the other one if she hasn't learnt by now how to use it from watching the others use it and I've opened it for her as well and she's gone through <pause dur="short"/> but she's not even tried to work out how to open it herself <pause dur="short"/> I don't think all of a sudden she's going to learn when you're on holiday</u>
<u n="434" who="S0019">I I'm just a bit nervous about leaving them out all day and the fact that our bloody cats eat your cat's food</u>
<u n="435" who="S0018">but when you go away on holiday does someone come round and lock your cat in for the night?</u>
<u n="436" who="S0017">no</u>
<u n="437" who="S0018">so you're cats can go out <pause dur="short"/> well if it's going to be summer why don't we just <trunc>st</trunc> um restrict your cats to downstairs and my cats to upstairs?</u>
<u n="438" who="S0019">well we can't really other than</u>
<u n="439" who="S0017">doesn't work does it? The the barrier</u>
<u n="440" who="S0018" trans="overlap">kitchen door</u>
<u n="441" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> it just means that whoever comes in to feed them has got to make sure that they're in there um they don't escape</u>
<u n="442" who="S0018">well they're hardly going to escape are they?</u>
<u n="443" who="S0019">no but it's difficult when you've got four of them to try and round up particularly <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> they are much more difficult to control</u>
<u n="444" who="S0017">I think the the bigger problem is each eating the others food than <pause dur="short"/> I think yours yours are quite relaxed in wandering about the house and apart from <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> creating explosions at intervals the others aren't that fussed</u>
<u n="445" who="S0019">no I suppose the only problem is the the food situation <pause dur="short"/> I think it would be better if if eh well whoever comes to feed them clicks the cat flap so that they can't get out but can get in</u>
<u n="446" who="S0018">what? When?</u>
<u n="447" who="S0019">when they come in at night to feed them</u>
<u n="448" who="S0018">oh so you do normally do that?</u>
<u n="449" who="S0017">we haven't ever asked whoever's looking after them to do that</u>
<u n="450" who="S0018">Cos normally you get someone to come in once a day nay?</u>
<u n="451" who="S0019">no <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> because it's just our cats <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> coming twice a day</u>
<u n="452" who="S0017" trans="overlap">morning and evening</u>
<u n="453" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="454" who="S0019">but <pause dur="short"/> I would rather he did the morning and then <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> did the evening <pause dur="short"/> cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is not very reliable on doing the cat trays</u>
<u n="455" who="S0018">or the setting the house alarm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="456" who="S0017">mm</u>
<u n="457" who="S0019">no <pause dur="short"/> that's another problem <pause dur="short"/> um I think if we got <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to do the morning and asked <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to do the evening <pause dur="short"/> it would be better</u>
<u n="458" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="459" who="S0019">because there's your cat trays to be done as well</u>
<u n="460" who="S0018">yeah but if you're away for two weeks what I can just do is leave four cat trays</u>
<u n="461" who="S0019">oh the smell</u>
<u n="462" who="S0018">yeah I know but eh <pause dur="short"/> I don't know how much we can actually ask other people to do or</u>
<u n="463" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="464" who="S0018">if I'm in the country I'll just come back at the weekends to sort things out</u>
<u n="465" who="S0017">we've got to make provisional arrangements and then sort it out once we know specifically what's happening where you're going to be and</u>
<u n="466" who="S0017">we'll see what happens</u>
<u n="467" who="S0019">unless <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> could come in and do the trays</u>
<u n="468" who="S0018">the only problem is I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has booked a holiday with her family in the south of Spain around that time</u>
<u n="469" who="S0019">right</u>
<u n="470" who="S0018">but again if nobody's here the fact that there are four cat trays sitting there isn't going to inconvenience anybody <pause dur="short"/> but mm I'm more worried about I think I think they should be probably kept separate <pause dur="short"/> either my cats upstairs in those two rooms or my cats using the house and your cats having the kitchen the conservatory and the garden</u>
<u n="471" who="S0019">I think it's better that way because I would hate now to confine your two since they've been used to wandering the house <pause dur="short"/> I think it would be awful to shut them in those two rooms for two weeks <pause dur="short"/> I don't think that's fair at all</u>
<u n="472" who="S0018">but do you think it's equally fair on your cats to?</u>
<u n="473" who="S0019">yes</u>
<u n="474" who="S0017">well at least they've got the conservatory and in summer they do spend more time in the conservatory and they'll often sleep overnight in the conservatory</u>
<u n="475" who="S0019">and also</u>
<u n="476" who="S0017">and they've got the garden</u>
<u n="477" who="S0019">yup <pause dur="short"/> and in the summer I mean when we've been away before</u>
<u n="478" who="S0017">mm</u>
<u n="479" who="S0019">we've shut all the doors so that they've had really only the landing and the hall extra</u>
<u n="480" who="S0017">and one bedroom</u>
<u n="481" who="S0019">and one bedroom</u>
<u n="482" who="S0017">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so I can't really see that that would be a problem</u>
<u n="483" who="S0017">yeah</u>
<u n="484" who="S0019">if we shut them in the kitchen they've got plenty of room <pause dur="short"/> they've got plenty of beds in the kitchen and the conservatory and if it's nice weather they'll go out into the garden anyway</u>
<u n="485" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="486" who="S0019">so I think that's probably the best solution</u>
<u n="487" who="S0018">yes <pause dur="short"/> I don't <pause dur="short"/> I just feel a bit bad constricting your cats to</u>
<u n="488" who="S0019">they'll survive don't worry</u>
<u n="489" who="S0018">I know they will but <trunc>o</trunc> obviously if it would be more difficult if someone was locking them in at night <pause dur="short"/> and they still only had the kitchen then again they're only used they're used to only being able to go in the kitchen aren't they?</u>
<u n="490" who="S0017">mm night time though</u>
<u n="491" who="S0019">yeah kitchen and conservatory <pause dur="short"/> so it isn't going to make any difference to them</u>
<u n="492" who="S0018">we'll see</u>
<u n="493" who="S0019">it'll be difficult because this is the first time we've left the kittens for more than a couple of days</u>
<u n="494" who="S0018">they're not really kittens anymore though?</u>
<u n="495" who="S0019">no <pause dur="short"/> but I say the kittens to differentiate them from the others <pause dur="short"/> but they've never been left</u>
<u n="496" who="S0017">no</u>
<u n="497" who="S0019">for that length of time <pause dur="short"/> it's only been three or four days at the most <pause dur="short"/> so but they'll cope <pause dur="short"/> it won't be a problem</u>
<u n="498" who="S0017">well that's right <pause dur="short"/> we got <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> or his wife's parents came in while we were away <pause dur="short"/> yeah sorry</u>
<u n="499" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they kitten sat</u>
<u n="500" who="S0018"><trunc>J</trunc> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> from the upholsterers?</u>
<u n="501" who="S0017">yes</u>
<u n="502" who="S0019">well it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s parents</u>
<u n="503" who="S0018">oh they came and lived here?</u>
<u n="504" who="S0017">yeah</u>
<u n="505" who="S0019">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> no it went very well but can't even remember where we went <vocal desc="laugh"/> It's gone <pause dur="short"/> in the mist</u>
<u n="506" who="S0017">no</u>
<u n="507" who="S0018">somewhere sunny as long as it has sun for you you don't care where it is</u>
<u n="508" who="S0017" trans="overlap">memorable</u>
<u n="509" who="S0019" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="510" who="S0017" trans="overlap">no it wasn't anywhere like that</u>
<u n="511" who="S0019">no it <trunc>wa</trunc> it wasn't <pause dur="short"/> I haven't been anywhere sunny <pause dur="short"/> this June will be two years</u>
<u n="512" who="S0018">aw</u>

<u n="515" who="S0019">when we went to France</u>

<u n="522" who="S0018">isn't every summer here not very good?</u>
<u n="523" who="S0019">no no <pause dur="short"/> we have had some nice weather but last year was awful wasn't it?</u>

And she said no <pause dur="short"/> not that I know of <pause dur="short"/> why? And I said well we have never had an acknowledgement from them for anything we've ever sent for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> And there was a sort of silence and eh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> obviously talked to them and they were both horrified because each of them thought that the other one had done it <pause dur="short"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said they lead such chaotic lives <pause dur="short"/> they are not organised at all about anything um so she can quite understand why each of them thought the other one had done it</u>
<u n="576" who="S0018">is <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> working?</u>
<u n="577" who="S0019">yes eh part time I think <pause dur="short"/> I don't think she's working full time</u>

Seventy-two and looking after <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I've no doubt she'll look after the little one as well <pause dur="short"/> I think she's beginning to find it all a little bit too much <pause dur="short"/> I mean when she was looking after um <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she was a lot younger <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="582" who="S0018">maybe she will start leaving them in the sandpit on their own</u>
<u n="583" who="S0019">well they ought to be able to by now <pause dur="short"/> but oh I went out to play in the sandpit with them but my idea of playing is different to to theirs <pause dur="short"/> mine is give them an idea and let them get on with it <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="584" who="S0018">distract them</u>
<u n="585" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I did potato printing with them um and we did eh collecting leaves and dipping the leaves in paint and making the leaf prints <pause dur="short"/> things like that and different things out of the kitchen that you can make patterns with <pause dur="short"/> um and what did we do in the sand pit? Oh I that's right <pause dur="short"/> cos the sand was quite damp and I said oh see if you can make tunnels in the sand dig down and see if you can get the tunnels to to meet in the middle and things like that and just let them get on with it <pause dur="short"/> and the response after we'd gone was that um aunty <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and uncle <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> were better at play than nana and grandpa <pause dur="short"/> which I thought was a little bit difficult but no they don't develop imagination and thinking for themselves if you're always doing things with them <pause dur="short"/> you've got to give them the idea and then let them go</u>
<u n="586" who="S0018">that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> katie's daughter I mean she's eighteen months old but I think maybe cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s a single mum it's <pause dur="short"/> she's had to let her do stuff on her own <pause dur="short"/> but she she keeps herself occupied for half an hour on her own? No problem just sit there playing and you hear her go na na na na na na like she's pretending to have conversation's between different teddy bears and</u>
<u n="587" who="S0019">but that's what I used to do with you two <pause dur="short"/> andrew was not so good at it with you <pause dur="short"/> but no they those were your toys play with them <pause dur="short"/> that's what they're there for <pause dur="short"/> I mean obviously there are times when you sit down and play as well and you sit and you read but not be with all the time telling them what to do and that's just far too child intensive for me</u>

<u n="634" who="S0019">oh no <pause dur="short"/> he'd noticed <pause dur="short"/> we all we'd done was to drive down the road in the car and stop and unload and somehow he managed to suss that there was only one house in the road that had a blue door</u>

<u n="647" who="S0018">when is he getting it?</u>
<u n="648" who="S0019">well certainly not for another week <pause dur="short"/> um I'm surprised they'll let it go because even Cats Protection League wouldn't let us have the kittens until they were nearly twelve weeks old</u>
<u n="649" who="S0018">yes but they were super</u>
<u n="650" who="S0019">yeah</u>
<u n="651" who="S0018">anal about things weren't they?</u>
<u n="652" who="S0019">yes if you get it from some private individual they'll usually let them go until after eight weeks seven or eight weeks <pause dur="short"/> em but they've got to be inoculated defleed checked over by a vet <pause dur="short"/> because the one worry about having them from those sort of conditions this cat flu em this feline leukaemia thing <pause dur="short"/> so they've got to be checked over by a vet um <pause dur="short"/> then he's got to make arrangements for somebody to come and feed it while he's at work</u>
<u n="653" who="S0018">oh of course</u>
<u n="654" who="S0019">Cos it's too little to be left all day um</u>
<u n="655" who="S0018">can't he take it to work in his pocket?</u>
<u n="656" who="S0019"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Bring your cat to work week <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="657" who="S0018">it'll be tiny <pause dur="short"/> put it in his pocket</u>
<u n="658" who="S0019">so until he gets all that sorted eh he can't make any arrangements as to when he can have the kitten <pause dur="short"/> and I am assuming that it's been taken away from the house and into the rescue centre</u>
<u n="659" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="660" who="S0019">but I'm not absolutely sure</u>

<u n="662" who="S0019">I don't know whether it was a concerned family member or neighbour or what I have no idea <pause dur="short"/> but eh it certainly looks a cute little thing</u>

<u n="664" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> a little fluffy</u>

<u n="670" who="S0019">yes but her name is <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>? I suppose it could be <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> I suppose like my goldfish <pause dur="short"/> that we called <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="671" who="S0018">when it was a female goldfish?</u>
<u n="672" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I won it at the fair <pause dur="short"/> brought it home in a plastic bag put it in a fish bowl on the sideboard and that was fine except when we moved we decided we didn't really want to take a goldfish with us so we gave it to my uncle <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who had a fish pond in his garden and <vocal desc="laugh"/> Then we discovered that it wasn't <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> but it led a charmed life because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> used to sit on the side board and he would feign indifference until he would realise that we weren't looking and in went the paw tried to catch it <pause dur="short"/> he never did <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> it's was the best place for it really <pause dur="short"/> it's cruel  It's cruel  to keep a goldfish in a round small round bowl</u>
