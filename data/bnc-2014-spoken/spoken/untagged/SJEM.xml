<u n="57" who="S0230">I'm doing the bonus ball at work as well now got into that again</u>
<u n="58" who="S0198">what is that when you do the bonus ball?</u>
<u n="59" who="S0230">well everybody when it used to be a pound everybody paid in a pound and if your bonus ball came up you got the money so you got forty-eight pound</u>
<u n="60" who="S0198">oh from all the staff? nice</u>
<u n="61" who="S0230">well forty-eight people that are in it</u>
<u n="62" who="S0198">oh participating</u>

<u n="64" who="S0198">mm</u>

<u n="71" who="S0230"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0198">but how many staff do you?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0230">but but you keep that but no well</u>
