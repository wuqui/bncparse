<u n="1081" who="S0013">buried in the deep aren't they?</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0370">yeah yeah they do like tubers</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0013">well they're all indoors now so</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0370">yeah?</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0013">my tubers</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0370">but they'll still be active probably if it's warm</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0013">you reckon?</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0370">this'll be much <unclear/></u>
<u n="1089" who="S0013">yeah yeah oh the these bits though that I <pause dur="short"/> when I did the tuber bits the two bits I should have done it earlier really <pause dur="short"/> but you know</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0370" trans="overlap">are you?</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0013" trans="overlap">those bits that were in water?</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0370">yeah</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0013">that one it's definitely</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0370" trans="overlap">oh there we are</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0013">that one's definitely there and this one still looks healthy</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0370">it is</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0013">so if I'd have done it <pause dur="short"/> earlier in the year I think I'd have got some good stuff <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0370">yeah never thought of doing cuttings from begonias really but</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0013" trans="overlap">well unless</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0370" trans="overlap">they're nice fleshy things I should think in water they probably do live quite well yeah</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0013">I heard that you you can only do it from well yes it's the case isn't it if they flower you can't <pause dur="short"/> can't take cuttings from that can you? in general</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0370">well it's the same with all plants</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0370" trans="overlap">really <pause dur="short"/> they don't tend to root as well when they're in flower</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0013" trans="overlap">well they were all see I looked at them and then I thought well they're all every bit isn't is flowered <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="1106" who="S0370">well it's just the chemicals in the plant</u>
<u n="1107" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1108" who="S0370">that promote the flowering</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0013">so it was difficult to get</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0370" trans="overlap">don't promote the rooting</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0013">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0370">yeah</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0013">mm guess whatever it is</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0370">I use I they don't do it anymore</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0013" trans="overlap">that that's</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0370" trans="overlap">from Wilko <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="1117" who="S0013" trans="overlap">that's strange cos oh</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0370">that's the one they gave you</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0013" trans="overlap">no leaf and there's there's two like there's more buds coming in here</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0370">oh right oh good</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0013">the <unclear/></u>
<u n="1122" who="S0370">yeah erm Wilko had this erm these packets of of fungus <pause dur="short"/> in clay</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0370">and you sprinkle the pellets micro micro something something something erm</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0013"><trunc>mi</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0370">what what it does it it it it's symbiotic with plant roots</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0370" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0012">oh</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0370">the fungus grows on the plant root</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0370">alright? it uses the plant root as its <pause dur="short"/> base</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0370">but at the same time it digests food out of the soil <pause dur="short"/> for the plant</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0012">oh right that's <trunc>wei</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0370">so it it it makes your plants much healthier and they</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0013">really?</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0370">they develop a more extensive root system</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0013">oh is it?</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0370">erm all you do is sprinkle a bit in your pots and</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0013">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="1142" who="S0370">well it's so when you pot anything you've grown indoors you plant outside</u>
<u n="1143" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0370">and you've got these this tiny fungus growing <pause dur="short"/> it's the mycelium of it that does it</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0370">in your veg patch and they <trunc>wi</trunc> you will have a stronger root with the are the Royal Horticultural</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0013" trans="overlap">so is it</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0370" trans="overlap">Society developed it</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0013">oh right is it that white stuff you sometimes see on there</u>
<u n="1150" who="S0370">yeah</u>
<u n="1151" who="S0013">over their soil?</u>
<u n="1152" who="S0370">yeah but there are lots of different types</u>
<u n="1153" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1154" who="S0370">so this one is particularly good</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="1156" who="S0370">erm the Royal Horticultural Society developed it</u>
<u n="1157" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1158" who="S0370">Wilko had it for sale last year</u>
<u n="1159" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="1160" who="S0370">but not they didn't this year well <pause dur="short"/> the year before last they did they didn't last year</u>
<u n="1161" who="S0013">yeah</u>

<u n="1163" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="1164" who="S0370">cos l reckon it was quite <trunc>effecti</trunc> and then you can put it in hanging baskets you can put it in</u>
<u n="1165" who="S0013">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1166" who="S0370">yeah and it will improve the the root system</u>
<u n="1167" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0370">mm</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0013">mm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="1170" who="S0370">but I guess they won't keep selling it cos the people who have already bought it <pause dur="short"/> it will now be in the soil</u>
<u n="1171" who="S0013">right I see</u>
<u n="1172" who="S0370">so once you've established it and you go I mm you've got it haven't you?</u>
