<u n="3" who="S0084">fine</u>
<u n="4" who="S0041">and yeah and er I saw a black one a navy one</u>
<u n="5" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="6" who="S0041">and I  and I  couldn't see this one <pause dur="short"/> and I just looked behind</u>
<u n="7" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0041">there was one <pause dur="short"/> and it was a fourteen <pause dur="short"/> and now it's mine</u>
<u n="9" who="S0084">ah <pause dur="short"/> you get such bargains don't you</u>
<u n="10" who="S0041">and now it's mine</u>
<u n="11" who="S0084">huh</u>
<u n="12" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's quite  it's quite  tight <pause dur="short"/> like I can only just fasten it <pause dur="short"/> but hopefully by</u>
<u n="13" who="S0084">that's fine though</u>
<u n="14" who="S0041">wedding time I'll be an inch smaller</u>
<u n="15" who="S0084">that looks really good <pause dur="short"/> you <trunc>b</trunc> but you can button it <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean? Like</u>
<u n="16" who="S0041">just</u>
<u n="17" who="S0084">you don't need to worry about not buttoning it</u>
<u n="18" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I might worry about moving</u>
<u n="19" who="S0084">breathing in and out</u>
<u n="20" who="S0041">after all the dinner</u>
<u n="21" who="S0084">well <trunc>j</trunc> <trunc>j</trunc> well just generally yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0084">but um after all the dinner and all the dancing</u>
<u n="24" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0084">oh mate <pause dur="short"/> it looks really nice <pause dur="short"/> I like the colours together</u>
<u n="26" who="S0041">it's shoe time tomorrow <pause dur="short"/> huh</u>
<u n="27" who="S0084"><unclear/> shoes <pause dur="short"/> yay</u>
<u n="28" who="S0041">shoe time  shoe time  So how did the meeting go?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0084">er actually it was really good <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was really good <pause dur="short"/> um tut one of those meetings where everyone comes away with points <pause dur="short"/> which is what I wanted really <pause dur="short"/> I didn't want <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to feel like we were ganging up on him and saying you didn't do this <pause dur="short"/> you didn't do that <pause dur="short"/> why did they do this? Why did er they do that? As project manager I think it was really useful for him to be able to say well how about we do it this way? Cos it's sort of the end of two projects <pause dur="short"/> but we've got four more to finish off <pause dur="short"/> and then two more coming <pause dur="short"/> so we need to get it right</u>
<u n="30" who="S0041">nip it in the bud now <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0084">but is was a er a big learning curve for everybody</u>
<u n="32" who="S0041">oh that's good</u>
<u n="33" who="S0084">so it was really useful <pause dur="short"/> it was er good <pause dur="short"/> it <trunc>g</trunc> went on longer than I thought it would <pause dur="short"/> cos everyone had more to say than I thought they would <pause dur="short"/> so I think generally it actually was quite a productive meeting</u>
<u n="34" who="S0041">sounded like everyone wanted the meeting <pause dur="short"/> everyone seemed to have something to</u>
<u n="35" who="S0084">everyone wanted the meeting <pause dur="short"/> everyone brought stuff to the meeting <pause dur="short"/> which I think was good <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't just that I'd compiled all of the feedback and then people were just like yeah right well you do all the talking <pause dur="short"/> we're just gonna sit here <pause dur="short"/> like</u>
<u n="36" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0084">I think even though no one had actually responded to me so I didn't know if anyone actually would come with anything to say <pause dur="short"/> I think that's what I was most nervous about <pause dur="short"/> that no one had really responded <pause dur="short"/> so I'd sent out the agenda <pause dur="short"/> and I'd sent out the talking points <pause dur="short"/> and I guess just cos everyone's really busy <pause dur="short"/> but in their head they were like yep <pause dur="short"/> great <pause dur="short"/> gonna bring stuff to talk about <pause dur="short"/> tut <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so yeah it was good <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0041">ah</u>
<u n="39" who="S0084">I'm just  I'm just  knackered <pause dur="short"/> really</u>
<u n="40" who="S0041">I'm very knackered</u>
<u n="41" who="S0084">really tired</u>
<u n="42" who="S0041">very knackered in the world <pause dur="short"/> in the worm</u>

<u n="49" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="50" who="S0041">then I went all the way to Marks and Spencers after finding a this colour orange one online</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="65" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> tut <pause dur="short"/> but in the ordinary</u>

<u n="82" who="S0041">or if I find another one <pause dur="short"/> which is gonna have to be Bravissimo tomorrow</u>
<u n="83" who="S0084">or or you don't have the straps <pause dur="short"/> so you have like a sort of basque thing pushing it up and holding it in</u>
<u n="84" who="S0041">tut</u>
<u n="85" who="S0084">you know <pause dur="short"/> like your zip up</u>

<u n="447" who="S0084">in of your overdraft <pause dur="short"/> and then they will charge you an interest rate <pause dur="short"/> so that but how can that be different? How can that be a hundred and eighty pounds but it was a hundred and thirty-two pounds but it was sixty pounds?</u>
<u n="448" who="S0041">because the amount I'm over my overdraft limit is increasing <pause dur="short"/> so every time they're putting a charge on they're taking <unclear/></u>
<u n="449" who="S0084">yeah so that's not but that's not the interest <pause dur="short"/> that's not interest is it <pause dur="short"/> a hundred and eighty pounds?</u>
<u n="450" who="S0041">no but the percentage</u>
<u n="451" who="S0084">yeah but that can er that can never be the percentage</u>
<u n="452" who="S0041">I think they're working this out</u>
<u n="453" who="S0084">though can it</u>
<u n="454" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> course it can <pause dur="short"/> cos if my limit's</u>
<u n="455" who="S0084">unless er unless it's er <trunc>f</trunc></u>
<u n="456" who="S0041">five hundred <pause dur="short"/> and then at this point where they charge me a hundred and thirty-two</u>
<u n="457" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="458" who="S0041">I'm over my overdraft limit by a hundred and thirty-eight pounds <pause dur="short"/> so perhaps I mean I don't know cos I'm not very good at maths but perhaps a hundred and thirty-two is the initial charge plus</u>
<u n="459" who="S0084">the interest</u>
<u n="460" who="S0041">a percentage of how much you're over <pause dur="short"/> because I'm only over a hundred and thirty-eight pounds it's a percentage of that against the five hundred <pause dur="short"/> because obviously once they put another charge on and I'm four hundred pounds over</u>
<u n="461" who="S0084">well that would be the explanation <pause dur="short"/> but that interest rate is fucking huge</u>
<u n="462" who="S0041">isn't it</u>
<u n="463" who="S0084">that's like fifty percent</u>
<u n="464" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="465" who="S0084">that's not three percent or six percent</u>
<u n="466" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="467" who="S0084">or whatever is the standard</u>
<u n="468" who="S0041">that's like nutty on the TV loan</u>
<u n="469" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="470" who="S0041">payday thing</u>
<u n="471" who="S0084">yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> aPR that's like twelve you know two thousand percent</u>
<u n="472" who="S0041">and my interest on there</u>
<u n="473" who="S0084">you need to work that out</u>
<u n="474" who="S0041">on the account usually is like really low <pause dur="short"/> that's why I've always kept it and always paid it off</u>
<u n="475" who="S0084">we need to work it out</u>
<u n="476" who="S0041">and the kicker is that if they  if they  look back on my accounts</u>
<u n="477" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> huh</u>
<u n="478" who="S0041">is if they took out every single error that's been theirs I've always been really good with it <pause dur="short"/> always kept on top of it <pause dur="short"/> always</u>
<u n="479" who="S0084">it's weird</u>
<u n="480" who="S0041">always paid it back over the month <pause dur="short"/> as you're supposed to <pause dur="short"/> cos I wanted to  my credit rating up</u>
<u n="481" who="S0084">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="482" who="S0041">and any time it's ever gone over or there's been a problem it's been their error</u>
<u n="483" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="484" who="S0041">I mean this isn't their error <pause dur="short"/> this is them just being unbelievable</u>
<u n="485" who="S0084">I think it is their error <pause dur="short"/> because I just can't see how that can be a charge <pause dur="short"/> even if it's the initial charge for breaking your overdraft agreement and then the interest there's no way that it can be a hundred and eighty pounds in the space of not even four months <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>e</trunc> cos that's only one charge <pause dur="short"/> or maybe it's two charges <pause dur="short"/> that's the conversation that you remember having</u>
<u n="486" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="487" who="S0084">the guy saying you've got another charge due <pause dur="short"/> but according to this you've only gone over your overdraft that one time <pause dur="short"/> so unless it's something historical</u>
<u n="488" who="S0041">I have no idea</u>
<u n="489" who="S0084">I mean what you need to go and do is go back and trace you know the last sort of six months <pause dur="short"/> nine months <pause dur="short"/> a year <pause dur="short"/> and total how many times you've broken your overdraft and total what they've taken from you</u>
<u n="490" who="S0041">mm</u>
