<u n="3" who="S0426">young man?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0425">the issue er that er I'm I'm currently in the process of marking the second years' work</u>
<u n="5" who="S0426" trans="overlap">ah well don't mention any</u>
<u n="6" who="S0425" trans="overlap">well it's all <trunc>mar</trunc> it</u>
<u n="7" who="S0426">don't mention any names</u>
<u n="8" who="S0425" trans="overlap">no of course not</u>
<u n="9" who="S0426" trans="overlap">that'll be okay</u>
<u n="10" who="S0425" trans="overlap">of course erm it's all so it's all er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s moderated it et cetera er the only thing I was gonna ask is about rounding up</u>
<u n="11" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0425"><trunc>f</trunc> so for the <trunc>ti</trunc> <trunc>d</trunc>does it do they have to be the using the grey boundaries?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0426">yes</u>
<u n="14" who="S0425">right</u>
<u n="15" who="S0426">now it depends whether all the questions are of equal weight are they?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0425">they're fifty fifty yes</u>
<u n="17" who="S0426">okay that's</u>
<u n="18" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0426">how many there are two questions?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0425">two questions fifty yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0426">alright</u>
<u n="22" who="S0425"><trunc>s</trunc>so er er</u>
<u n="23" who="S0426">you have two options one you could mark each question with the usual forty-two forty-five</u>
<u n="24" who="S0425">uhu</u>
<u n="25" who="S0426">forty-eight</u>
<u n="26" who="S0425" trans="overlap">which is er that's</u>
<u n="27" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0425" trans="overlap">that's</u>
<u n="29" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0425" trans="overlap">what I have done <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="31" who="S0426" trans="overlap">then you add up the two</u>
<u n="32" who="S0425">yes</u>
<u n="33" who="S0426">and then <pause dur="short"/> okay you you er round up that's the only way to do it really</u>
<u n="34" who="S0425" trans="overlap">right okay yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0426" trans="overlap">okay now</u>
<u n="36" who="S0425" trans="overlap">cos that's er so I've got</u>
<u n="37" who="S0426" trans="overlap">but hang on a minute hang on a minute</u>
<u n="38" who="S0425" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="39" who="S0426">that will never produce anything that requires rounding up because it won't be in fractions the only rounding up happens is when you <pause dur="short"/> add things which'll produce a fraction like</u>
<u n="40" who="S0425" trans="overlap">uhu</u>
<u n="41" who="S0426" trans="overlap">forty-eight point five goes</u>
<u n="42" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="43" who="S0426" trans="overlap">to the forty-nine</u>
<u n="44" who="S0425">right</u>
<u n="45" who="S0426">you don't</u>
<u n="46" who="S0425" trans="overlap">but</u>
<u n="47" who="S0426">you do not round up forty-nine to fifty</u>
<u n="48" who="S0425">right but because the department has the the boundaries you know the erm er from the coursework so it's like seventy-five sixty-eight those</u>
<u n="49" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0425">so the <pause dur="short"/> the one I've just er calculated so two questions sixty-eight and seventy-five</u>
<u n="51" who="S0426">right</u>
<u n="52" who="S0425">added together divided by two brings out seventy-one point five</u>
<u n="53" who="S0426">okay yeah when you have the coursework and the exam that will produce then you do er round up</u>
<u n="54" who="S0425">yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0426" trans="overlap">and that gives you</u>
<u n="56" who="S0425">to seventy-five</u>
<u n="57" who="S0426">yes</u>
<u n="58" who="S0425">right</u>
<u n="59" who="S0426">well hang on a minute <pause dur="short"/> er say those two numbers again</u>
<u n="60" who="S0425">er <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>s</trunc> er <trunc>sev</trunc>seventy-five and sixty-eight</u>
<u n="61" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="62" who="S0425">and I think it's seventy-one point five? I think <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0426">oh seventy-one point five?</u>
<u n="64" who="S0425">seventy-one</u>
<u n="65" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes seventy-two I thought you said</u>
<u n="66" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0426" trans="overlap">seventy-five</u>
<u n="68" who="S0425" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="69" who="S0426">oh yeah yeah yeah that's seventy-two no problem</u>
<u n="70" who="S0425" trans="overlap">so it's</u>
<u n="71" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0425">so so seventy-two</u>
<u n="73" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0425">is is</u>
<u n="75" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0425" trans="overlap">fine</u>
<u n="77" who="S0426">is what you put down</u>
<u n="78" who="S0425" trans="overlap">it doesn't have to be seventy-five you know because of the</u>
<u n="79" who="S0426">oh I see what you mean</u>
<u n="80" who="S0425" trans="overlap">the do you see what I mean? the</u>

<u n="85" who="S0426" trans="overlap">no no no no</u>
<u n="86" who="S0425" trans="overlap">just a whole number?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0426">just a whole number whatever that</u>
<u n="88" who="S0425" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="89" who="S0426" trans="overlap">whole number whether that whole number exists in our marking scheme or not</u>
<u n="90" who="S0425">is irrelevant?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0426" trans="overlap">is irrelevant</u>
<u n="92" who="S0425">super right</u>
<u n="93" who="S0426">alright good</u>
<u n="94" who="S0425" trans="overlap">okay that's</u>
<u n="95" who="S0426" trans="overlap">otherwise yeah you'd be really inflating</u>
<u n="96" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0426">the scores</u>
<u n="98" who="S0425">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0425">no that's what I</u>

<u n="104" who="S0425" trans="overlap">that was my concern</u>
<u n="105" who="S0426">yes so</u>
<u n="106" who="S0425" trans="overlap">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> wasn't a hundred percent sure so I thought oh I know</u>
<u n="107" who="S0426">hang on what's <vocal desc="laugh"/> he been doing</u>
<u n="108" who="S0425" trans="overlap">I I I</u>
<u n="109" who="S0426" trans="overlap">these last ten years then?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0425"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="111" who="S0426">oh god and I suppose all those</u>
<u n="112" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="113" who="S0426" trans="overlap">firsts two years ago</u>

<u n="119" who="S0426">what are you doing it on?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0425" trans="overlap">well <pause dur="short"/> er er</u>
<u n="121" who="S0426" trans="overlap">what are you examining on?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0425">oh well it's er individual differences yeah so</u>
<u n="123" who="S0426">so our</u>
<u n="124" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0426" trans="overlap">second year lot</u>
<u n="126" who="S0425">the second year</u>
<u n="127" who="S0426">and how are they looking?</u>
<u n="128" who="S0425">I'm quite impressed actually yeah yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0426" trans="overlap">well that's good to hear</u>
<u n="130" who="S0425">yeah there's erm I mean they're obviously they've tended to go for certain questions</u>
<u n="131" who="S0426">yes</u>
<u n="132" who="S0425" trans="overlap">over</u>
<u n="133" who="S0426">sure</u>
<u n="134" who="S0425" trans="overlap">over over others and er you know but <trunc>y</trunc>yeah I I think the sort of er I haven't calculated the mean yet but it's I I would anticipate it's gonna be in the sixties</u>
<u n="135" who="S0426">blimey</u>
<u n="136" who="S0425">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0426">well that's impressive</u>
<u n="138" who="S0425">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0426" trans="overlap">erm</u>
<u n="140" who="S0425">no I mean even some of the students that perhaps we wouldn't expect</u>
<u n="141" who="S0426" trans="overlap">well yeah yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0425" trans="overlap">to do as well</u>
<u n="143" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0425">have have erm yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0426" trans="overlap">well I <pause dur="short"/> that's very pleasing of course in one <trunc>se</trunc> I'm looking for my distribution of er Cog anyway it's largely</u>
<u n="146" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0426">in the Cs</u>
<u n="148" who="S0425">right okay</u>
<u n="149" who="S0426">largely in the Cs so <pause dur="short"/> you know maybe I've been slightly tougher</u>
<u n="150" who="S0425">or maybe it's a <trunc>ca</trunc> cos er you know in in I I I have asked er a few of the students you know how how are the exams and stuff and and I think they found the questions for the individual differences exam easier <pause dur="short"/> so maybe that maybe it's a an issue of questions? I don't know it's do er I I mean the the questions for individual <trunc>dis</trunc> differences were very er <pause dur="short"/> they were fairly open</u>
<u n="151" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="152" who="S0425">so <pause dur="short"/> they couldn't really get it wrong if they'd done revision</u>
<u n="153" who="S0426" trans="overlap">if they knew the material</u>
<u n="154" who="S0425">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0426">okay well <pause dur="short"/> that's a fairly generous way of asking questions to be sure</u>
<u n="156" who="S0425">mm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0426">er <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> has been tried to make us <pause dur="short"/> er synchronise our styles for exams but <pause dur="short"/> with pressures of time people</u>
<u n="158" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="159" who="S0426" trans="overlap">just haven't had the time to do that</u>
<u n="160" who="S0425" trans="overlap">and I think <trunc>i</trunc> that's not always possible with different cos <trunc>y</trunc>you you're gonna have different materials</u>
<u n="161" who="S0426">well</u>
<u n="162" who="S0425">erm er</u>
<u n="163" who="S0426" trans="overlap">er <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s point is you could always ask er you should always ask a question which allows or require sorry not allows requires critical</u>
<u n="164" who="S0425">yes</u>
<u n="165" who="S0426">analysis</u>
<u n="166" who="S0425" trans="overlap">oh absolutely yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0426" trans="overlap">of something</u>
<u n="168" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="169" who="S0426" trans="overlap">right er because the student otherwise will just simply reproduce as it were what he she knows about X</u>
<u n="170" who="S0425">yes I know</u>
<u n="171" who="S0426" trans="overlap">er now sometimes you can do it by putting in that word in the title critically</u>
<u n="172" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="173" who="S0426" trans="overlap">evaluate the contribution of Z to</u>
<u n="174" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="175" who="S0426" trans="overlap">you know whatever er but if you don't then it you might well get these fairly voluminous answers er which you might feel obliged to give marks to because the volume is there</u>
<u n="176" who="S0425">yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0426" trans="overlap">but if they don't have the critical analysis</u>
<u n="178" who="S0425" trans="overlap">the that's right now I mean erm <pause dur="short"/> there are I <trunc>mea</trunc> that that one of the more popular questions was you know critically evaluate</u>
<u n="179" who="S0426">right</u>
<u n="180" who="S0425">er</u>
<u n="181" who="S0426">and did they in fact</u>
<u n="182" who="S0425" trans="overlap">some</u>
<u n="183" who="S0426" trans="overlap">critically evaluate?</u>
<u n="184" who="S0425" trans="overlap">and the good students did</u>
<u n="185" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="186" who="S0425">the</u>
<u n="187" who="S0426" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="188" who="S0425">the er less capable tended to just sort of a give you a <pause dur="short"/> a verbatim account of you know <trunc>w</trunc> well essentially was just the textbook <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="189" who="S0426">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="190" who="S0425" trans="overlap">er and and er if they did that proficiently with <pause dur="short"/> erm some sort of contrasting and comparing with other <pause dur="short"/> then then they were in the Bs lower</u>
<u n="191" who="S0426" trans="overlap">alright okay</u>
<u n="192" who="S0425" trans="overlap">if they if they demonstrated extra reading erm and the you know it was er they they clearly understood they had a decent structure and stuff like that then they were moved up higher that was the sort of</u>
<u n="193" who="S0426">how high would you go on that kind of</u>
<u n="194" who="S0425">I don't think I</u>
<u n="195" who="S0426" trans="overlap">material?</u>
<u n="196" who="S0425">I I went any higher than sort of giving seventy-five</u>
<u n="197" who="S0426">er how how many seventy-fives did you give?</u>
<u n="198" who="S0425">not <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> possibly sort of er <pause dur="short"/> three or four perhaps?</u>
<u n="199" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="200" who="S0425" trans="overlap">not</u>
<u n="201" who="S0426" trans="overlap">alright</u>
<u n="202" who="S0425" trans="overlap">sort of</u>
<u n="203" who="S0426" trans="overlap">okay yeah</u>
<u n="204" who="S0425" trans="overlap">not a a</u>
<u n="205" who="S0426" trans="overlap">alright</u>
<u n="206" who="S0425">massive proportion there was quite a few sort of Bs B pluses</u>
<u n="207" who="S0426">okay alright</u>
<u n="208" who="S0425" trans="overlap">but but er but there was also a fair few <pause dur="short"/> lower as well I mean <pause dur="short"/> some of them were very very poor</u>
<u n="209" who="S0426">we've said this to each other</u>
<u n="210" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0426">before about this particular cohort you know <pause dur="short"/> but they were there they did it</u>
<u n="212" who="S0425" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="213" who="S0426">they got the mark er and that mark is a I'm sure a pass mark</u>
<u n="214" who="S0425">yeah</u>
<u n="215" who="S0426">so good luck to them</u>
<u n="216" who="S0425">absolutely</u>
<u n="217" who="S0426" trans="overlap">and with the probably inevitably better coursework</u>
<u n="218" who="S0425">yes yeah well the coursework was a bit more of a mixed bag so that's it so I I think I <trunc>th</trunc> the tendency was perhaps for them to have done slightly better in the exam</u>
<u n="219" who="S0426">really?</u>
<u n="220" who="S0425">rather than the coursework</u>
<u n="221" who="S0426" trans="overlap">that's extremely unusual</u>
<u n="222" who="S0425">yeah because the <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>c</trunc> I I think the problem with the coursework was erm <pause dur="short"/> they were over ambitious with</u>
<u n="223" who="S0426" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="224" who="S0425">with the sort of material</u>
<u n="225" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="226" who="S0425" trans="overlap">they were <trunc>try</trunc> and and so again there was there were some students who did very well and I think the ones who did very well in the coursework probably did less well in the exam</u>
<u n="227" who="S0426">mm</u>
<u n="228" who="S0425" trans="overlap">but the ones that did less well in the coursework <pause dur="short"/> seemed to have put maybe it's a case of they thought I'd better put some effort in</u>
<u n="229" who="S0426">well it could be just</u>
<u n="230" who="S0425"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="231" who="S0426">regression to the mean I mean there is</u>
<u n="232" who="S0425" trans="overlap">oh it oh it's yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="233" who="S0426" trans="overlap">an element of that of course <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="234" who="S0425"><trunc>ye</trunc></u>
<u n="235" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
