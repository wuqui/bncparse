<u n="463" who="S0109">and it's another thing er at a time when you feel probably if you're anything like me that</u>
<u n="464" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="465" who="S0109">church should actually be helping you say no to things by not offering you more things <pause dur="short"/> and certainly not by telling you you ought to be doing</u>
<u n="466" who="S0050">yeah well we weren't really offered it were we <pause dur="short"/> we were <trunc>tol</trunc> I felt awful when I spoke to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> like I basically</u>

<u n="469" who="S0050">yeah <pause dur="short"/> we were told we had to do it didn't weren't we</u>
<u n="470" who="S0109">yeah</u>
<u n="471" who="S0050">and</u>
<u n="472" who="S0123">wow <pause dur="short"/> the thing is like you guys are all have been doing this for a while for the experience so</u>
<u n="473" who="S0034">that's but they're they're making it compulsory for new leaders <pause dur="short"/> but it wasn't actually compulsory for us</u>
<u n="474" who="S0123">oh okay</u>
<u n="475" who="S0034">although they kind you know there was that kind of assumption that we would do it</u>
<u n="476" who="S0109">I E <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said well I'm gonna sign you up for it <pause dur="short"/> if you really don't want to do it then come and tell me</u>
<u n="477" who="S0123"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Okay</u>
<u n="478" who="S0050">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was really funny when he announced it <pause dur="short"/> like there was a real silence around the table</u>
<u n="479" who="S0034"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="480" who="S0050">I felt a bit like oh <pause dur="short"/> I felt like we should be positive</u>
<u n="481" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="482" who="S0109">well</u>
<u n="483" who="S0050">um</u>
<u n="484" who="S0109">the trouble is if you announce it on a Friday night at like half ten</u>
<u n="485" who="S0050"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="486" who="S0109">when everyone's just wants to go to bed</u>
<u n="487" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="488" who="S0109">you're not gonna get a positive response are you</u>
<u n="489" who="S0050">yeah</u>
<u n="490" who="S0123">I kind of feel though that new leaders</u>
<u n="491" who="S0034"><unclear/></u>
<u n="492" who="S0123">new leaders should be shipped into Twenty Twenty and then we should be moving leaders on from twenty twenty into other things <pause dur="short"/> rather than cos if you think about it leading twenty twenty is probably the easiest thing you could do because you're you're leading your peers <pause dur="short"/> you're just um</u>
<u n="493" who="S0109">but it won't help you in any way for for leading for children's work cos it's just so different</u>
<u n="494" who="S0123">um <pause dur="short"/> I think in terms of like I guess cos with all this like the stuff you've just been doing there the your knowledge of scripture and this kind of and that kind of stuff <pause dur="short"/> twenty the leading twenty twenty does equip you with <pause dur="short"/> and of course you know being able to study a passage look at it and then try and you know work out questions and express <pause dur="short"/> I think it provides all the foundations <pause dur="short"/> you still have to build upon it but</u>
<u n="495" who="S0109">but just doing a Bible study every so often in your home group would would manage that</u>
<u n="496" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="497" who="S0050">I I'm not I don't know what I think about Pathfinder leading now <pause dur="short"/> cos I think it's quite hard <pause dur="short"/> and I think</u>
<u n="498" who="S0109">mm</u>
<u n="499" who="S0050">if you've just started coming to Church or you wanna get involved and you wanna get serving I think it would be a really hard place to to get serving <pause dur="short"/> like I think you're really well supported</u>
<u n="500" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="501" who="S0050">but I think a lot of is is expected of you in terms of being able to manage to lead groups <pause dur="short"/> to manage behaviour <pause dur="short"/> to to stand up and do talks</u>
<u n="502" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="503" who="S0050">um</u>
<u n="504" who="S0109">it's far more intimidating than say Scramblers</u>

<u n="506" who="S0034"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="507" who="S0109">scramblers for a start they don't care about coolness or anything like that</u>

<u n="511" who="S0050">yeah</u>
<u n="512" who="S0109">but it's just that age group plus the fact that they're at that level when they're really spiritually starting to engage</u>
<u n="513" who="S0050">yeah</u>
<u n="514" who="S0109">and you feel the responsibility</u>

<u n="611" who="S0123">there was also a discussion on the apocalypse as well</u>
<u n="612" who="S0034"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="613" who="S0123">there was that was er interesting <pause dur="short"/> turning up and people um yeah saying like so where did you get your inspiration for writing books about the apocalypse? And do you find it stressful? And duh duh duh <pause dur="short"/> um</u>

She was like well I don't really know but he's an important person</u>
<u n="624" who="S0034"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="625" who="S0123">so <pause dur="short"/> well apparently <trunc>ea</trunc> <trunc>ea</trunc> each one does is different <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> so it would depend upon the personality of the person as opposed to the job</u>

<u n="794" who="S0123"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I was reading something interesting er on the um resurgence <pause dur="short"/> um and it had had an interesting comment <pause dur="short"/> not I haven't  to my family but it was just an observation that said that every family is broken <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>sta</trunc> you start off with a you know if you get married and you have a family <pause dur="short"/> so you start off with a broken family because everyone's flawed and everything <pause dur="short"/> um it's just a question of how quickly you realize it</u>
<u n="795" who="S0109">oh <pause dur="short"/> what do you mean broken?</u>
<u n="796" who="S0050">gosh that's quite sad <pause dur="short"/> so what's the  what's the  kind of</u>
<u n="797" who="S0123">it was the</u>
<u n="798" who="S0050">what the feeling is that</u>
<u n="799" who="S0123">well he</u>
<u n="800" who="S0050">because it's broken</u>
<u n="801" who="S0123">well so he the guy was saying he was sort of so he was <unclear/> so I <trunc>th</trunc> so he said a lot of people say like oh my family was absolutely fine until my dad walked out <pause dur="short"/> or my um you know my marriage was really was great until I found out my wife was being unfaithful <pause dur="short"/> and there there's lots of these kind of um so <trunc>p</trunc> people have like a big disaster in the family <pause dur="short"/> it just seems to be something you hear that they they blame the brokeness in the family on a particular event or a particular person making</u>
<u n="802" who="S0050">yeah</u>
<u n="803" who="S0123">a particular mistake <pause dur="short"/> and he said it's um probably what you need to realize is that the family was broken all along you just couldn't see it <pause dur="short"/> um and you know</u>
<u n="804" who="S0050">what and it just took an event?</u>
<u n="805" who="S0123">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and he said actually if you think about it</u>
<u n="806" who="S0050">for you to realize it</u>
<u n="807" who="S0123">you know you you kind of extend that there you have to assume that everyone's family is in some way broken <pause dur="short"/> um and you have to be proactive to try and keep it together and to um you know help it survive <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="808" who="S0109">well no family's gonna survive without work</u>
<u n="809" who="S0123">no <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="810" who="S0109">but that doesn't mean every family is broken <pause dur="short"/> cos broken implies something</u>
<u n="811" who="S0050">I'm not sure about the word broken</u>
<u n="812" who="S0109">is er</u>
<u n="813" who="S0123">well okay so the the the if I try a different analogy <pause dur="short"/> the um er guy who founded Pixar <pause dur="short"/> ed Catmull um gave an <trunc>interv</trunc> interview with the um er Economist which was <trunc>v</trunc> he <trunc>re</trunc> where he <trunc>re</trunc> I think he revealed himself to be a very wise man <pause dur="short"/> he said about Pixar he said so you know that Pixar make you know consistently great movies <pause dur="short"/> um but he said the thing I have to accept about Pixar is that there is already something going wrong with it and I can't see it because I'm blinded to it <pause dur="short"/> he said I accept that there are problems in the company that I just can't see <pause dur="short"/> that I er that that I have a blind spot for <pause dur="short"/> er um and then he he went on to talk about like you know ways in which he try you know he has to keep his hand on the rudder and this kind of stuff <pause dur="short"/> and I think that that that I think that's true for <trunc>e</trunc> everything and every every relationship we have not just sort of the companies <pause dur="short"/> that there are always things going wrong <pause dur="short"/> things are out out of balance <pause dur="short"/> things where the emphasis are on the wrong place <pause dur="short"/> um and you just have to accept that you know fundamentally we're all imperfect people <pause dur="short"/> um er and whenever you get more than one imperfect person in a place you've got trouble brewing</u>
<u n="814" who="S0050">hence why you never have a perfect Church</u>
<u n="815" who="S0123">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="816" who="S0050">and if you do then you must</u>
<u n="817" who="S0123">completely not</u>
<u n="818" who="S0050">leave cos you'll ruin it</u>
<u n="819" who="S0123">mm <pause dur="short"/> the thing you think about a Church <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> you've got a bunch of people all going damn I'm screwed <pause dur="short"/> I need a saviour <pause dur="short"/> turning up in the same building <pause dur="short"/> that's never gonna wind up nice</u>
<u n="820" who="S0050">yeah</u>
<u n="821" who="S0123">I was trying to explain that to er my colleague <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who thought that she was asking me whether I <trunc>di</trunc> whether I thought that maybe heaven might be the Church now <pause dur="short"/> and I was like</u>

<u n="823" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="824" who="S0123">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I mean it would be I could kind of see her point if you really idolize the Church community and failed to see any of the problems with it then you could be like well maybe this was a manifestation of you know <pause dur="short"/> to some extent</u>
<u n="825" who="S0034">it is</u>
<u n="826" who="S0123">the embodied Christ <pause dur="short"/> it is <pause dur="short"/> but not in a final she was like saying it in a sort of final this is it way <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="827" who="S0034">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="828" who="S0050">I think always before I've been really annoyed when I've  when I've  seen non-Christians being really nice</u>

<u n="1689" who="S0034">oh</u>
<u n="1690" who="S0050">although it I think it is quite frustrating <pause dur="short"/> cos I think it's one of those things where like every musical instrument you kind of that you're rubbish and then you get reasonably good quite quickly <pause dur="short"/> have this</u>
<u n="1691" who="S0109">oh yeah and then you have to work hard at it after that</u>
<u n="1692" who="S0050">kind of really fun thing and then it's quite hard work <pause dur="short"/> so I'm at  I'm at  that stage <pause dur="short"/> having started the um I could just about drum a rhythm</u>

<u n="1694" who="S0050">and feel like I'm in control of the drums <pause dur="short"/> but actually to do anything better I now need to properly practise <pause dur="short"/> and I can't be bothered <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I was like that with the trumpet <pause dur="short"/> I borrowed a <trunc>trump</trunc> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s trumpet don't know how long ago <pause dur="short"/> two years ago <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I learnt to play it <pause dur="short"/> so I could play the notes <pause dur="short"/> I could play a scale <pause dur="short"/> I could play some rough things <pause dur="short"/> and then I couldn't be bothered any more <pause dur="short"/> it was a bit boring after I'd learnt to play it</u>

<u n="1707" who="S0050">well no <pause dur="short"/> I really wanted to play it cos I wanted to be able to play er in carols</u>
<u n="1708" who="S0109">ah</u>
<u n="1709" who="S0050">I think it's fun then</u>
<u n="1710" who="S0109">I suppose</u>
<u n="1711" who="S0050">you do all the descants <pause dur="short"/> but you have to learn to play quite high for that</u>
<u n="1712" who="S0034">why is it not an exciting instrument?</u>
<u n="1713" who="S0109">but there are just some instruments which you know you look at them and you think I want to play that <pause dur="short"/> and I don't  I don't  feel that with the trumpet</u>
<u n="1714" who="S0123">the trumpet's more of an iconic thing <pause dur="short"/> I mean er <trunc>t</trunc> Louis Armstrong's a trumpeter isn't he <pause dur="short"/> and um er</u>
<u n="1715" who="S0050">huh?</u>
<u n="1716" who="S0123">was it Louis Armstrong was a trumpeter wasn't he?</u>
<u n="1717" who="S0050">yep</u>
<u n="1718" who="S0123">and that kind of stuff <pause dur="short"/> so you've got a couple of like really iconic guys who play the instrument <pause dur="short"/> and that sells it to you <pause dur="short"/> that's what something like the um for me you know some of the other instruments like er clarinet <unclear/> someone cool to be the face of it</u>
<u n="1719" who="S0034">Benny Goodman</u>
<u n="1720" who="S0123">Benny who? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1721" who="S0034">Benny Goodman</u>
<u n="1722" who="S0123">you see there's the problem there</u>
<u n="1723" who="S0034">king of the clarinet</u>
<u n="1724" who="S0050">I don't think the clarinet is that  is that  cool and trendy</u>
<u n="1725" who="S0034">no <unclear/></u>
<u n="1726" who="S0123">but it it <trunc>la</trunc> it lacks someone to make it cool</u>
<u n="1727" who="S0034">A lot of people um see it as a holder <pause dur="short"/> clarinet and then I'll do the saxophone <pause dur="short"/> that's the cool point</u>
<u n="1728" who="S0050">and then what?</u>
<u n="1729" who="S0034">learn the clarinet before you learn the saxophone</u>
<u n="1730" who="S0050">yeah <pause dur="short"/> which is ridiculous</u>
<u n="1731" who="S0034">but that would just confuse me because the fingering's different</u>
<u n="1732" who="S0050">because the fingering's different and the saxophone I think is much easier isn't it?</u>
<u n="1733" who="S0123">hm</u>
<u n="1734" who="S0050">than clarinet</u>
<u n="1735" who="S0034">er I dunno</u>
<u n="1736" who="S0123">I dunno</u>
<u n="1737" who="S0034">yeah</u>
<u n="1738" who="S0109">but if you did the soprano wouldn't it be the same?</u>
<u n="1739" who="S0050">no I can pretty much play the <trunc>s</trunc> the saxophone <pause dur="short"/> just because I played the oboe <pause dur="short"/> cos the fingering's the same</u>
<u n="1740" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="1741" who="S0050">and I could play a lot of tunes on a saxophone <pause dur="short"/> but I couldn't really play the clarinet</u>
<u n="1742" who="S0109">oh okay</u>
<u n="1743" who="S0050">I find it that much harder</u>
<u n="1744" who="S0034">really?</u>
<u n="1745" who="S0050">yeah</u>
<u n="1746" who="S0109">I think the clarinet suffers because of the oboe</u>
<u n="1747" who="S0123"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1748" who="S0050">do you think so?</u>
<u n="1749" who="S0109">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos the oboe's more distinguished than like the clarinet is</u>
<u n="1750" who="S0034">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I agree</u>
<u n="1751" who="S0050">yeah</u>
<u n="1752" who="S0034">and they look kind of the same so therefore</u>
<u n="1753" who="S0123">they must be the same</u>
<u n="1754" who="S0034"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Apart from the clarinet doesn't sound quite as good <pause dur="short"/> although it's very difficult to get a good noise out of an oboe I think</u>
<u n="1755" who="S0050">I think the <trunc>g</trunc> the good thing about the clarinet is you can play quite funky music with it <pause dur="short"/> in a way that you just can't with the oboe</u>
<u n="1756" who="S0123">how come?</u>
<u n="1757" who="S0050">um <pause dur="short"/> the oboe just doesn't really have the sound <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1758" who="S0034">you don't really play jazz oboe do you <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="1759" who="S0123"><unclear/> just</u>
<u n="1760" who="S0050">the jazz oboe is</u>
<u n="1761" who="S0034">although I'm really disappointed I have never really played jazz clarinet</u>
<u n="1762" who="S0050">is yet to be discovered</u>
<u n="1763" who="S0034">Cos that is actually quite cool <pause dur="short"/> I mean I listen to like some Supertramp songs and I'm like oh man</u>
<u n="1764" who="S0123">this could've been me <pause dur="short"/> I could've been</u>
<u n="1765" who="S0034"><unclear/> jazz clarinet and stuff</u>
<u n="1766" who="S0123">you know <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="1767" who="S0050"><shift new="singing"/> <unclear/> <shift new="normal"/></u>
<u n="1768" who="S0123">I love the end of um was it Joni Mitchell's playing Real Good for Free <pause dur="short"/> there's I think there's jazz clarinet at the  at the  end of that <pause dur="short"/> sounds absolutely awesome</u>
<u n="1769" who="S0034">but then soprano sax is also very cool</u>
<u n="1770" who="S0123">so I I tried playing the sax <pause dur="short"/> obviously I wasn't very good <pause dur="short"/> but I just there was part of me which you see well I love playing the classical er guitar cos even though I'm not very good at it it can make a nice sound <pause dur="short"/> and I just never got the feeling <trunc>wi</trunc> like with that with the saxophone <pause dur="short"/> I was <trunc>alw</trunc> it always felt like you know maybe it was just the instrument I had but</u>
<u n="1771" who="S0050">but</u>
<u n="1772" who="S0123">it didn't feel like it was ever gonna make a nice sound <pause dur="short"/> there wasn't <unclear/></u>
<u n="1773" who="S0050">but the <trunc>guita</trunc></u>
<u n="1774" who="S0034">but I think partly you know</u>
<u n="1775" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="1776" who="S0034">you just have to <trunc>g</trunc> you just have to you just get better and better</u>
<u n="1777" who="S0050">yeah</u>
<u n="1778" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="1779" who="S0034">and you can  you can  always tell someone who's better than someone else <pause dur="short"/> because your sound gets better</u>
<u n="1780" who="S0050">I think the <trunc>gui</trunc></u>
<u n="1781" who="S0034">and there's no way of skipping that out</u>
<u n="1782" who="S0050">the guitar as well like it's like the piano <pause dur="short"/> um in a sense</u>
<u n="1783" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="1784" who="S0050">that it's like everything's there <pause dur="short"/> you don't need anything else</u>
<u n="1785" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="1786" who="S0050">whereas with the saxophone you kind of  you kind of  need something else <pause dur="short"/> you can't just play the saxophone on its own <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't really sound that good</u>
<u n="1787" who="S0034">no</u>
<u n="1788" who="S0123">mm</u>
<u n="1789" who="S0050">unless you're amazing <pause dur="short"/> um whereas put it in a band or put it with some kind of accompaniment of some sort</u>
<u n="1790" who="S0123">oh okay</u>
<u n="1791" who="S0050">and it'd be really cool <pause dur="short"/> but your guitar you could just sit and strum or you can just sit and play</u>
<u n="1792" who="S0123">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1793" who="S0050">and you don't need to have anything else</u>
<u n="1794" who="S0123">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I just think something I think that that's the thing for me er an instrument for me to be able to learn an instrument it has to sound good yeah by itself <pause dur="short"/> it has to  it has to  be able to engage me by itself <pause dur="short"/> and um ideally you know needs to I think something like a guitar and a probably more so the piano it's the  it's the  mostly the instrument that's making the kind of the basic sound <pause dur="short"/> and it's learning how to put the note you know to your technique is is improving <pause dur="short"/> you you know unless you're mashing <trunc>t</trunc> two keys at once you're <trunc>gen</trunc> you're you're genuinely getting you know most of the sound out of the individual note</u>
<u n="1795" who="S0050">yeah</u>
<u n="1796" who="S0123">whereas with a saxophone</u>
<u n="1797" who="S0034">it's all about mashing two keys at once though</u>
<u n="1798" who="S0050">I think that's yeah I quite like that</u>
