<u n="745" who="S0142" trans="overlap">yeah go off this I think we're far too laid back</u>
<u n="746" who="S0144">you can't travel on this road because you don't have the the correct authorisation</u>

<u n="751" who="S0142" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> I don't think it's used as well as it should be because CCTV cameras in city centres they've saved er lots of people <pause dur="short"/> they can spot somebody being assaulted mugged</u>
<u n="752" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="753" who="S0142">and they're there for our protection if you look at it that way <pause dur="short"/> if you're a wrongdoer</u>
<u n="754" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="755" who="S0142">yeah beware <pause dur="short"/> but what would you ever do that you are really concerned about somebody watching do when you're walking around the city?</u>
<u n="756" who="S0144">no that's not the point <pause dur="short"/> the point is once that system's in place</u>
<u n="757" who="S0142">mm</u>
<u n="758" who="S0144">it can be used for different purposes in the future <pause dur="short"/> once you've allowed it to er get established</u>
<u n="759" who="S0142">mm</u>
<u n="760" who="S0144">then later on it can really be used to oppress the people <pause dur="short"/> that's why I'm worried</u>
<u n="761" who="S0142">erm <pause dur="short"/> if it got to that state where CCTV imaging around city centres got to the point where it could repress people I would've thought most people would have had the cameras down by then</u>
<u n="762" who="S0144">no but that's what I mean</u>
<u n="763" who="S0142">they'd have gone armed with shotguns and they'd have blasted it <unclear/> Problem solved</u>
<u n="764" who="S0144" trans="overlap">no but I think most people are saying what you're saying how it it's it's a good thing</u>
<u n="765" who="S0142">mm</u>
<u n="766" who="S0144">but it's these they do things by such like little erm incremental steps over such a long period of time that</u>
<u n="767" who="S0142">yeah yeah softy softy yeah</u>
<u n="768" who="S0144">that people don't notice it</u>
<u n="769" who="S0142">mm</u>
<u n="770" who="S0144">people don't question it <pause dur="short"/> and then before they know it like bang they've got all this stuff around them</u>
<u n="771" who="S0142">no no it's a  it's a  separate issue now because from what I was saying about fines</u>
<u n="772" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="773" who="S0142">now fines I think should be means tested</u>
<u n="774" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="775" who="S0142">because a millionaire now I've known people that are very very wealthy <pause dur="short"/> they'll park on the in the city centre <pause dur="short"/> right on the traffic lights cos it's near their office and they get sixty pound fine a day</u>
<u n="776" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="777" who="S0142">so what?</u>
<u n="778" who="S0144">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="779" who="S0142">I'll just claim that against the expenses <pause dur="short"/> you know?</u>
<u n="780" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="781" who="S0142">and they think nothing of it <pause dur="short"/> but a bloke earning a hundred and fifty pound a week <pause dur="short"/> a sixty pound fine is as serious <unclear/> as whether his kids have a dinner every day this week</u>
<u n="782" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="783" who="S0142">and that's the difference</u>
<u n="784" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="785" who="S0142">and so I think it you know it should be means tested like that <pause dur="short"/> millionaires can speed so what? I'll get another ticket <pause dur="short"/> I've got another ticket and so it's only a five hundred pound fine this time</u>
<u n="786" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="787" who="S0142">somebody who's earning a million pound a year five hundred quid is sod all</u>
