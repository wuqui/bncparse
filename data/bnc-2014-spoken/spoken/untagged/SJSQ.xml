<u n="1" who="S0486">there we are so yeah what's happening there is happening on thatch roofs</u>
<u n="2" who="S0523">oh right</u>
<u n="3" who="S0486">that there are rooks pulling off all the straw off thatch roofs</u>
<u n="4" who="S0523">oh dear</u>
<u n="5" who="S0486">and erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah er come over here and we can all talk together in fact</u>
<u n="6" who="S0523">oh yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0486">erm you carry on talking about that in there and I'll make coffee</u>
<u n="8" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes I think it's some something to do with the weather and maybe the the bugs that they're looking for in the grass and have proliferated through the warm weather through the winter</u>
<u n="9" who="S0523">yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0489">perhaps you know</u>
<u n="11" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0489">unfair really</u>
<u n="13" who="S0523">I know <pause dur="short"/> so few <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> certainly the garden's looking very nice actually isn't it? you know for this this for this time of year</u>
<u n="14" who="S0489" trans="overlap">we've we've we've got it reasonably stable now I think that's the thing</u>
<u n="15" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0489">cos you've finished the fencing I see all the fencing <unclear>all along</unclear> here</u>
<u n="17" who="S0523" trans="overlap">oh yes yeah yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0489" trans="overlap">just paint the horizontals yet</u>
<u n="19" who="S0523">yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0489">but er and we've put a path down this side of the fence</u>
<u n="21" who="S0523">right</u>
<u n="22" who="S0489">so you can get into the far side of the borders without too much difficulty that makes it a bit different</u>
<u n="23" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah excellent yeah</u>
<u n="24" who="S0489">so yeah it's it's reached a fairly stable situation I think</u>
<u n="25" who="S0523">the grass looks pretty good as well doesn't it? I mean apart from there where the crow's doing that <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yes we had a <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah that's just so unfortunate</u>
<u n="28" who="S0523">yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0486">because we had a lot of moss and erm well between myself and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> we got rid of it because <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I sprinkled a lot of this stuff on and I made some nasty black patches in the grass</u>
<u n="30" who="S0523" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0486">and ruined the lawn however</u>
<u n="32" who="S0523">mm mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0486">Alan Titchmarsh said that he'd done the same thing and he's never going to use that product again</u>
<u n="34" who="S0523" trans="overlap">oh yeah? <pause dur="short"/> oh really?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0486">er yeah that I heard that subsequently</u>

<u n="37" who="S0486">erm so erm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0523">and what so what did do you do?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0486">erm it was erm er er er you sprinkle it on it was a dry mix that you had to sprinkle on to the erm <pause dur="short"/> to the er <pause dur="short"/> moss</u>
<u n="40" who="S0523">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0486">and then I thought it would just seep into the ground and the moss would die</u>
<u n="42" who="S0523">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0486">instead of that it burned the moss and made it black</u>
<u n="44" who="S0523">yes yes</u>
<u n="45" who="S0486">so you have ghastly black patches all over the lawn</u>
<u n="46" who="S0523">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0486">which you well obviously didn't really want so erm now I've er er now erm we got rid of those last year so that went the lawn grew back it looked wonderful and then</u>
