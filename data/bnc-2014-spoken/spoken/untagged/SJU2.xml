<u n="1" who="S0454">so what did you think about that audio recording from Peter Kinderman?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0453">erm you mean the one talking about erm the factors contributing to mental health and <trunc>we</trunc> mental wellbeing and whether it's nature or nurture?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0454">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="4" who="S0453">I mean you know he he spends a long time telling us what we already know which is that</u>
<u n="5" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="6" who="S0453">it's a combination of the two</u>
<u n="7" who="S0454">it's kind of I mean that one's an introduction to his new book so I suppose it's a kind of obvious place to start that you sort of state the bleeding obvious erm and look at the historical context and then say there are some problems with it</u>
<u n="8" who="S0453" trans="overlap">plant <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0454">that you can't really say it's nature and you can't really say it's nurture it's a bit of both</u>
<u n="10" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0454">that makes sense</u>
<u n="12" who="S0453">yeah it does</u>
<u n="13" who="S0454">erm but I don't know it's I mean at the moment it seems like <trunc>n</trunc> psychology and psychiatry they're leaning more towards nurture erm but it seems like the treatment is still based on nature so then he was saying about how dopamine and serotonin are linked to wellbeing but like my sister's taken anti-depressants and I know those are</u>
<u n="14" who="S0453">so has mine</u>
<u n="15" who="S0454">SSSIs which are about serotonin uptake</u>
<u n="16" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0454">so if we say if we're accepting that it's mostly nurture why are we messing with the chemistry of the brain?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0453">I think the reason that medication is used in in these situations is because the symptoms can be so acute that doing elementary things like just plodding along with life and not not taking everything out on other people can be a real challenge so that's where medication comes in it's like a short term erm bridge to help you get to the long term goal of getting better which I agree with you is not going to be through medication it's going to be improving the erm <trunc>e</trunc> improving your your wellbeing through environmental factors and and wanting to get better and surrounding yourself with with people and and erm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm mm yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0453">yeah so so I think I think medication does have a role</u>
<u n="21" who="S0454">okay</u>
<u n="22" who="S0453">it's not that it doesn't have a role at all but erm particularly in depression I think anxiety is a bit different because with anxiety</u>
<u n="23" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="24" who="S0453">anxiety pills are really erm intended as short term medication and and not more and actually</u>
<u n="25" who="S0454">but isn't this is the danger that because GPs are busy that you go in</u>
<u n="26" who="S0453" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0454">okay initially you get prescribed some anti-depressants nothing wrong with that as you say people need a short term survival solution</u>
<u n="28" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0454">but then because GPs are busy they just let you have prescription after prescription and of course that's not going to solve the problem</u>
<u n="30" who="S0453">true this is true erm the er especially with the GP cuts</u>
<u n="31" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0453">that we have now and they're less likely to erm take a considered approach to the individual patient</u>
<u n="33" who="S0454">what do you mean by GP cuts that there are less of them?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0453" trans="overlap">well the cuts no well they it's not that there are less of them but they've got less erm well now that GPs are managing their own budgets GP surgeries</u>
<u n="35" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0453">they are prioritising cheaper treatments they are <trunc>tryi</trunc> it's like a factory production line they're trying to get through patients as quickly as possible</u>
<u n="37" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah this is a huge mistake isn't it? letting GPs manage their budgets</u>
<u n="38" who="S0453" trans="overlap">it is it is a huge mistake er and it basically it it's trying to central government are trying to save the administrative burden of dealing with those budgets</u>
<u n="39" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0453">er and also they're trying to incentivise those GPs to limit those budgets</u>
<u n="41" who="S0454">right</u>
<u n="42" who="S0453">but it's actually backfiring because it's having a catastrophic effect on the quality of patient care</u>
<u n="43" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0453">and particularly around mental health which you know to this day society even developed <trunc>s</trunc> you know sort of supposedly civilised societies like like in the UK erm think that mental they just don't view mental health as being on a par with physical health</u>
<u n="45" who="S0454">true</u>
<u n="46" who="S0453">they just don't</u>
<u n="47" who="S0454">even though actually people take more time off over stress and other mental issues than they do for physical ailments</u>
<u n="48" who="S0453">yeah yeah I mean you know you look at erm look at er someone who has been depressed for fourteen years</u>
<u n="49" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="50" who="S0453">for example erm they can't work they can't do anything they they don't have a hope of that they're going to improve that's not different to someone who has erm let's say a chronic disability</u>
<u n="51" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0453">they can't you know so so this is this is what needs to this this needs to change this idea that that mental health is you know the the sort of soldier on and you know pull yourself together and carry on approach</u>
<u n="53" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="54" who="S0453">erm which unfortunately is still prevalent in not just I mean not just in societies that where you'd expect that to be the case where mental health doesn't necessarily get the attention that that it it warrants but also in the West I mean in in the UK</u>
<u n="55" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm true</u>
<u n="56" who="S0453">erm so that that that needs to change erm it's yeah it's of course it's nature and nurture erm and you're right that medication shouldn't be seen as the end</u>
<u n="57" who="S0454" trans="overlap">the solution mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0453">it's the means to the end</u>
<u n="59" who="S0454">mm yeah so it's a means to provide some space some distance between the problem and getting on with daily life but it can't be used as a permanent solution you can't give someone anti-depressants and then tell them to go to work and not address the root of the problem</u>
<u n="60" who="S0453">yeah absolutely absolutely right</u>
<u n="61" who="S0454">but then at the end where he says erm that if we can just think in a different way then we'll all be happier I don't know if that's realistic either like telling someone who's depressed just to think more positively well they might not be able to do that</u>
<u n="62" who="S0453">yeah it's a bit it's a bit erm it can be a bit delusional but</u>
<u n="63" who="S0454">for the average person they probably can like if you're not mentally ill and then someone er trained you to think more positively you're probably capable of doing that but for someone who's already depressed that's just going to be slightly less depressed perhaps at the end they're not going to suddenly get better</u>
<u n="64" who="S0453">yes erm absolutely and er I I don't think there are any easy answers and I think that each individual's erm condition will be unique and will have unique erm er causative factors and</u>
<u n="65" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0453">and and treatment options erm so that so that we can't look at this I mean we we can at a high level we know it's nature and nurture</u>
<u n="67" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0453">or we know that erm that the the traditional approach to mental health treatment might not always be the right way of going about things</u>
<u n="69" who="S0454">no</u>
<u n="70" who="S0453">so this idea about cognitive behavioural therapy <trunc>tre</trunc> training yourself to think positively all the time erm you know it it can be beneficial</u>
<u n="71" who="S0454">but it's not perhaps very realistic or even a very natural erm result because nobody is happy all the time it's natural for everyone to feel down sometimes</u>
<u n="72" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0454">and sometimes there might be a physical reason for it like you know women when they get their period we feel unnaturally depressed for a couple of days</u>
<u n="74" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0454">and sometimes it might be environmental that you had a bad day at work and sometimes there might not be any discernible reason for it but you know that's real life isn't it? we don't have to be happy all the time and we shouldn't feel we do</u>
<u n="76" who="S0453">yeah absolutely we shouldn't feel we do erm it's natural to have to have varying moods ups and downs erm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0453">that's just the way the way life is but where it becomes where you stray into the territory of mental illness and it's preventing you from leading a</u>
<u n="79" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0453">a you know <trunc>fr</trunc> it's affecting your quality of life that's where where you where it's different and the stigma attached to mental health unfortunately still exists</u>
<u n="81" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0453">erm you know there's still a perception that mental health is just not taken as seriously as as physical ailments</u>
<u n="83" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0453">and that needs to change</u>
<u n="85" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0453">I think I think the more honestly I think in this culture of celebrities and social media I think the more those celebrities come forward and say that they're open up about the mental illness that they've suffered depression</u>
<u n="87" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0453">the less you know the the more the <trunc>sa</trunc> stigma will reduce</u>
<u n="89" who="S0454">don't you think the terminology itself though is stigmatising? like saying erm depression I mean depression in itself is a negative word it sort of suggests greyness and you know er something going down like the I think he touches upon that but so he says so-called mental health issues</u>
<u n="90" who="S0453">yes</u>
<u n="91" who="S0454">that <pause dur="short"/> that in itself leads to people not being open about it that perhaps most people everybody feels bouts of depression that doesn't mean we're clinically depressed but it may be there are better words to use like we don't say patient any more about erm people who see a therapist we talk about clients and that kind of distances them from the idea that they're broken</u>
<u n="92" who="S0453" trans="overlap">yeah mm yeah <trunc>po</trunc>possibly although erm they are broken I mean the fact is</u>
<u n="93" who="S0454">are they?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0453">well I I</u>
<u n="95" who="S0454">isn't it natural if a woman lost her husband for example after fifty years that she would be depressed? and there's nothing unnatural about this process of serious grief and depression</u>
<u n="96" who="S0453">well absolutely</u>
<u n="97" who="S0454">and they don't need erm you know to be fixed per se they need to be given the space to explore their feelings which perhaps they don't have anyone to talk to because their husband died and that was their closest you know confidant of fifty years that they need someone outside to to take that place</u>
<u n="98" who="S0453">absolutely</u>
<u n="99" who="S0454">and be a listening ear and to to have given be able to give them some perspective but not to tell them to snap out of it and be happy</u>
<u n="100" who="S0453">no <trunc>absolu</trunc>absolutely right but I think that erm we're we need to focus on reducing stigma and effective treatments rather than changes of terminology and nomenclature that somehow in this consistent with this sort of politically correct approach to everything er that we think is going to make a meaningful difference cos this is not I mean you know to change terminology that's been built up over years around depression around a patient to then start calling it erm you know I don't know whatever you want to call it natural grief or client</u>
<u n="101" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0453">that's not go this isn't this is just we're dealing with little superficial changes here</u>
<u n="103" who="S0454">but you know it's like some words now have become unacceptable because of the stigma they have associated with them I don't mean mental health I mean what like for example down syndrome we used to call the mongaloid but I mean that was a very insulting term because that implies the Mongolia doesn't it? mongols because of the the way their eyes were and we've stopped using that because it's well it's insulting to everybody it's insulting to the person with the condition</u>
<u n="104" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0454">and it's also got nothing to do with the country or the the features so I think there is a place for using less judgemental language</u>
<u n="106" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0454">right? er the same way that</u>
<u n="108" who="S0453">definitely</u>
<u n="109" who="S0454">when we talk about black people we don't use words that have you know very accusative meaning or</u>
<u n="110" who="S0453">like what?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0454">well like you know people of colour is a very insulting phrase isn't it? I mean</u>
<u n="112" who="S0453">well</u>
<u n="113" who="S0454">what are we saying white people are the absence of colour?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0453">well well I mean look the way I see those is they go through phases don't they? I mean you know we had we had a a phase when we said half cast and then it went to mixed race and</u>
<u n="115" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0453">honestly I don't this I don't view as important</u>
<u n="117" who="S0454">it depends how they're used though</u>
<u n="118" who="S0453" trans="overlap">exactly</u>
<u n="119" who="S0454">if we only use these words negatively then selling someone you know you are this is going to give them erm a bad feeling about it but also they're not going to feel comfortable going to their employer and saying I have this like I have a personality disorder I mean what how is the employer going to view that employee if they go and say that they're not going to take them seriously any more they're going to be like oh personality disorder do I really want this person on my team? whereas perhaps if we had a different term for it</u>
<u n="120" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0454">or you know a very umbrella term for it then people wouldn't feel so bad going to their employer and saying erm I'm receiving therapy at the moment for some personal issues</u>
<u n="122" who="S0453">yes</u>
<u n="123" who="S0454">but yeah you're right it's it doesn't make the problem go away but I do think it can help address the stigma around it</u>
<u n="124" who="S0453">absolutely I think you're right on that note</u>
<u n="125" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah just go no sorry just one more thing <trunc>g</trunc> before we finish if you don't mind erm</u>
<u n="126" who="S0453">mm yeah sure</u>
<u n="127" who="S0454">the the thing you were saying about nature not being very important erm it was kind of peripheral to his argument I'm not sure I agree because like in my experience mental health issues do run in families</u>
<u n="128" who="S0453">yeah you're right</u>
<u n="129" who="S0454">and you could say well that's a product of their upbringing so for example bad parenting tends to be intergenerational you don't tend to find you know the grandparents were fantastic parents and then suddenly your parents were terrible I mean that doesn't happen</u>
<u n="130" who="S0453">no</u>
<u n="131" who="S0454">so it's because they didn't have a model of good parenting that the bad parenting model continues cos I mean you learn good parenting from somewhere and mostly it's quite unconscious isn't it? what you picked up as a child from living in your house for eighteen years but I'm not sure that alone explains it I think that there is something going on at a chemical level erm that is intergenerational and that is something genetic</u>
<u n="132" who="S0453">yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0454">so if you look at a family without much mental health much in the way of mental health problems then you'd look at it and go well that's nurture</u>
<u n="134" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0454">you know that one guy who's got mental health issues out of fifty relatives that must be nurture</u>
<u n="136" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0454">must be erm you know some experience he had maybe at school or something but when you see whole families where all the women seem to have nervous breakdowns that to me suggests that nature is quite important</u>
<u n="138" who="S0453">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0454">and it's only by tracking those families that you'll see that like I've got a great uncle who was in a mental asylum for most of his life but it turns out all of <trunc>h</trunc> my grandfather's brothers had nervous breakdowns at some point in their lives apart from him</u>
<u n="140" who="S0453">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0454">so I don't know I mean maybe his upbringing was so terrible that erm you know they all developed mental health issues but I don't think so that's not the impression I get their father was undoubtedly strict but it seems there was something biochemical there</u>
<u n="142" who="S0453">yeah definitely I think you're absolutely right and I think on that note erm we'll er we'll draw that one to a close thanks a lot</u>
