<u n="5" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="6" who="S0530">what what do you they plan to achieve with it?</u>
<u n="7" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0530" trans="overlap">and basically it's like everyone should be Muslim on earth and that something and I can't even remember <pause dur="short"/> yeah they believe that I'd not actually considered this but like I've heard people like talking about it on the internet like people like do you <trunc>thi</trunc> do you reckon like <pause dur="short"/> whether say like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> feels quite nervous being around like people that are non Muslim right now in case we have prejudices against him</u>
<u n="9" who="S0529" trans="overlap">probably</u>
<u n="10" who="S0530" trans="overlap">because</u>

<u n="12" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0529">I mean actually like I spoke to him yesterday and I didn't tell I didn't like talk to him about the Paris attacks</u>
<u n="14" who="S0530" trans="overlap">no neither did I</u>
<u n="15" who="S0529">even though I've been speaking to most people I've seen about the Paris attacks cos it's like you know</u>
<u n="16" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0529" trans="overlap">a topic of conversation or whatever</u>
<u n="18" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0529">but no I didn't I say like I didn't think about oh I'd better not say anything to him he might be quite you know sensitive about it I just didn't think like I just didn't</u>
<u n="20" who="S0530">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0529">but yeah I wonder how he feels about it <pause dur="short"/> yeah I hope he doesn't think that people are gonna judge him because</u>
<u n="22" who="S0530" trans="overlap">no <trunc>definit</trunc> not</u>
<u n="23" who="S0529" trans="overlap">I don't think they would here cos I feel like this is quite an accepting place</u>
<u n="24" who="S0530">you'd think so</u>
<u n="25" who="S0529">I mean we have a lot of international students here and I'm not saying he's an international student but I'm just saying like the tolerance level here seems to be <pause dur="short"/> you know higher than</u>
<u n="26" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="27" who="S0529">than it might be</u>
<u n="28" who="S0530" trans="overlap">like most places</u>
<u n="29" who="S0529" trans="overlap">somewhere else yeah <pause dur="long"/> but no it would be interesting to see what he thinks about the whole Isis thing</u>
<u n="30" who="S0530">I can imagine he'd feel quite angry</u>
<u n="31" who="S0529">yeah yeah I don't think I'd wanna <vocal desc="laugh"/> ask him about it to be honest <pause dur="short"/> I just I like think it would be a bit rude</u>
<u n="32" who="S0530">yeah er I mean only if it comes up in conversation or he</u>
<u n="33" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="34" who="S0530">chips in himself like <trunc>ki</trunc></u>
<u n="35" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="48" who="S0530">kind of like yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0529" trans="overlap">like when she was trying to convince me to go she was talking about how like the only reason she liked her uni is because of the people she'd met and that she doesn't really like the way it's taught because it's really bad there and they don't pay attention to</u>
<u n="50" who="S0530">the welfare of the students</u>

<u n="102" who="S0530">with the workload as well</u>
<u n="103" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0530" trans="overlap">because of everything and it's really sad because it sounds like the way <vocal desc="sigh"/> I mean she's been put on like she's got such so many roles and responsibility like part of her problem is that she just she just takes too much on so she does like she's like head writer of one of the magazines there and everything</u>
<u n="105" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="n"/> yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0530">yeah so it's just like <pause dur="short"/> and it's like they don't see like she needs a break kind of thing you know like she <trunc>nee</trunc> they need to maybe keep an eye on her and help her</u>
<u n="107" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="108" who="S0530">because she really does like I mean like I they just don't know the half of it really they just see like professionals that are in a professional environment like these hard working students</u>
<u n="109" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0530" trans="overlap">when actually behind it all it's not always</u>
<u n="111" who="S0529" trans="overlap">they're really struggling</u>
<u n="112" who="S0530">yeah yeah definitely</u>
<u n="113" who="S0529">mm <pause dur="short"/> no it's just it's messed up like when you put it together like the figures of the amount of people our age who who are suffering with mental health problems or you know any personal thing like that</u>
<u n="114" who="S0530">yeah it's huge</u>
<u n="115" who="S0529">and when you like put it together with a university that's the cause of it all the time it's just they need to just look at that and think</u>
<u n="116" who="S0530" trans="overlap">definitely</u>
<u n="117" who="S0529" trans="overlap">oh we're not doing we're we're not doing enough here to help people</u>
<u n="118" who="S0530">like despite our parents saying they had the same problems at our age they really didn't</u>
<u n="119" who="S0529">no</u>
<u n="120" who="S0530">they didn't think the same</u>
<u n="121" who="S0529" trans="overlap">it's different</u>
<u n="122" who="S0530">it is completely different</u>
<u n="123" who="S0529" trans="overlap">this generation is way more aware we're way more socially aware <pause dur="short"/> we are way more like we're more deep thinkers</u>
<u n="124" who="S0530">yeah we're more reflective people</u>
<u n="125" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0530">in general</u>
<u n="127" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah which is</u>
<u n="128" who="S0530" trans="overlap">to be honest</u>
<u n="129" who="S0529" trans="overlap">sometimes a bad thing I get that but</u>
<u n="130" who="S0530" trans="overlap">it's yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0529" trans="overlap">but most of the time</u>
<u n="132" who="S0530" trans="overlap">it can be a good thing</u>
<u n="133" who="S0529">yeah cos it means that we actually question things that we that maybe our parents didn't erm I think we have more of a capacity to change things</u>
<u n="134" who="S0530" trans="overlap">we're less passive with what we</u>
<u n="135" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yes definitely</u>
<u n="136" who="S0530">yeah definitely yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0529">but no on the whole I think we're a more kind of depressed</u>
<u n="138" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0529">generation</u>
<u n="140" who="S0530">we really are like <pause dur="short"/> I mean</u>
<u n="141" who="S0529">I mean that as like an umbrella term cos I feel like being depressed comes under all mental health problems really like</u>
<u n="142" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah I mean it's a symptom yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0529" trans="overlap">it's almost kind of a side effect isn't it? yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0530" trans="overlap">of every single one pretty much <pause dur="short"/> like it's just crazy like how many people I know that have been to like counsellors or</u>
<u n="145" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="146" who="S0530" trans="overlap">have been in hospital because of mental illness</u>
<u n="147" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0530" trans="overlap">and stuff and it's really sad</u>
<u n="149" who="S0529">it is</u>
<u n="150" who="S0530">like <vocal desc="sigh"/> like even in the last decade it's just been a huge increase like</u>
<u n="151" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="152" who="S0530">obviously like when you were in primary school you're not really aware of these things so you don't really know but I swear like people seemed to actually enjoy being teenagers then like when we were like in year six</u>
<u n="153" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="154" who="S0530">like there was there was probably still like you know a lot of pressure but I think I don't think people <trunc>ca</trunc> like teachers can't remember as many students breaking down over their exams and shit like</u>
<u n="155" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0530">it seems to be quite common to have anxiety attacks before exams now it's very normal <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="157" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="158" who="S0530">when I don't that <trunc>wha</trunc> used to be the case</u>
<u n="159" who="S0529">I think also it's because we have more kind of understanding of mental illness</u>
<u n="160" who="S0530">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0529">and there's less I mean the stigma <trunc>hasn</trunc>hasn't gone at all like I'm not suggesting that but</u>
<u n="162" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0529">people have definitely become more aware of it</u>
<u n="164" who="S0530">definitely</u>
<u n="165" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0530">I feel like I honestly like I know I thought like I was depressed a few years ago I really didn't actually know the depth of it until like</u>
<u n="167" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="168" who="S0530">this year</u>
<u n="169" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0530">I know that sounds really strange but like</u>
<u n="171" who="S0529" trans="overlap">doesn't sound strange it's like I don't really get the</u>
<u n="172" who="S0530">yeah</u>
<u n="173" who="S0529" trans="overlap">thing of not really knowing that you are depressed</u>
<u n="174" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0529" trans="overlap">cos it's like you've dealt with it for so long that you can just sort of</u>
<u n="176" who="S0530">yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0529">start to think that it's just what you're like</u>
<u n="178" who="S0530">I mean I had like it was quite weird this time because like last time I kind of knew what happened because obviously like physically I was bad and obviously like</u>
<u n="179" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="180" who="S0530">a side effect of anorexia actually is like so it's to like be depressed because of your lack of nutrients to the brain and shit</u>
<u n="181" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="182" who="S0530">so that was like <trunc>s</trunc>sort of like whatsit it was a reactive depression</u>
<u n="183" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0530">whereas this was like everything physically was fine <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="185" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0530" trans="overlap">and it was really scary because I didn't know why it happened like I was doing so well before Christmas and then it was just like after Christmas overnight it was almost just like whoa you know? and it was like I don't even know why or what's going on and I think when you can't pinpoint why this has happened like why now? it's so scary because you just don't know how to go about</u>
<u n="187" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0530" trans="overlap">treating it except with medication obviously if it</u>
<u n="189" who="S0529">about your eating disorder cos my friend like she had trouble with it and then it sort of came back and</u>
<u n="190" who="S0530">yeah</u>
<u n="191" who="S0529" trans="overlap">do you feel like yours has ever</u>
<u n="192" who="S0530">I feel like</u>
<u n="193" who="S0529" trans="overlap">like resurfaced?</u>
<u n="194" who="S0530" trans="overlap">it's changed in a way like if feel like in my head like to be honest like mentally I still feel the same I just have to do whatever the opposite of it says</u>
<u n="195" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0530">like I have to just like cos sometimes it is just so tempting to backslide like it's so difficult</u>
<u n="197" who="S0529" trans="overlap">that's so strong <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="198" who="S0530">but like it's just like you know what's gonna happen if you do like? you can and I don't wanna end up back where I was because it's such a miserable life like</u>
<u n="199" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="200" who="S0530">it can almost feel safer because part of the <trunc>a</trunc> not the appeal cos that sounds a bit like mm a bit but part of like the reason why a lot of people like end up kind of stuck relapsing again is because it kind of numbs everything like</u>
<u n="201" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="202" who="S0530">you kind of just shut down like your whole body and it kind of just like gives you this like</u>
<u n="203" who="S0529">it must give you like control as well</u>
<u n="204" who="S0530">oh definitely like you can totally like shut yourself down from anything negative and also like I think a big part of it as well is like when nobody when you have like when you're at a low way and when you <trunc>ha</trunc>have to drop out of everything nobody expects anything from you</u>
<u n="205" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="206" who="S0530">like you're not expected to function like a normal human and people understand that you've got something like mentally wrong with you</u>
<u n="207" who="S0529">mm</u>
