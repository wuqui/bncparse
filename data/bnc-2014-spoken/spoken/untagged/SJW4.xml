<u n="751" who="S0084">urgh <pause dur="short"/> do you get a lot of that?</u>
<u n="752" who="S0082">not recently <pause dur="short"/> cos I've been up to date <pause dur="short"/> but some you know I always that's always the way you know you sort of leave it for a week to do something and you think oh well you know it's not that urgent and then somebody sends you an e-mail saying you haven't put this on the website</u>
<u n="753" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="754" who="S0082">it is that really annoys me when that happens so</u>
<u n="755" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/> If I were you I would just do um a bullet point list of things that you</u>
<u n="756" who="S0082">yeah I should</u>
<u n="757" who="S0084">do every time <pause dur="short"/> and then you know</u>
<u n="758" who="S0082">mm</u>
<u n="759" who="S0084">that way you don't have to keep watching the video</u>
<u n="760" who="S0082">yeah I should do</u>
<u n="761" who="S0084">and it'll be in your own words</u>
<u n="762" who="S0082">mm <pause dur="short"/> I should do really <pause dur="short"/> I've got it so I I know exactly I how I you know I haven't solved the <trunc>prob</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I still haven't solved the problem yet</u>
<u n="763" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="764" who="S0082">so once I've solved the problem</u>
<u n="765" who="S0084">yep <pause dur="short"/> then you can write it down</u>
<u n="766" who="S0082">I'll do it <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="767" who="S0084">while it's in your mind</u>
<u n="768" who="S0082">see the easy way would be um what I use to do <pause dur="short"/> I on the um er Compaq er you know the PC that I had er</u>
<u n="769" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="770" who="S0082">which you know when you go in to the hosting er website which holds all the information you've got a web er um download on there <pause dur="short"/> so you can download it to your computer <pause dur="short"/> but you know I tried it dozens of times and it just won't download onto the Mac <pause dur="short"/> it it</u>
<u n="771" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="772" who="S0082"><trunc>doe</trunc> did it first time on er on the er um on the Compaq <pause dur="short"/> and then when I had to have the hard disk replaced er it did it first time on the new hard disk <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="773" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="775" who="S0084">it's weird isn't it</u>
<u n="776" who="S0082">so I have to go through this really long and that's why  that's why  I can't remember it <pause dur="short"/> cos there's so many stages to it that you know it's easy to make a <trunc>mis</trunc> even with the video it's easy to make a mistake</u>
<u n="777" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> maybe it's one of those things that is just better on a PC <pause dur="short"/> annoyingly</u>
<u n="778" who="S0082">yeah</u>
<u n="779" who="S0084">just lends itself better <pause dur="short"/> you know <trunc>p</trunc> whoever created it created it on a PC rather than Mac</u>
<u n="780" who="S0082">well I think so <pause dur="short"/> I mean it just er from some it just you know as there there's no reason why it shouldn't download this disk <pause dur="short"/> er but it won't <pause dur="short"/> it just won't do it</u>
