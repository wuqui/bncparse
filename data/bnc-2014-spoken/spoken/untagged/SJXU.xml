<u n="91" who="S0115"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0037">transformer</u>
<u n="93" who="S0115" trans="overlap">Steven Steven Seagal oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0037">but like me and my nana went to see Little Women and my nana was like it's amazing and I was like</u>

<u n="99" who="S0115">it sounds to me like I think of uh big men is more up my street than little women</u>
<u n="100" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> maybe big men is right up your street <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="101" who="S0115">I think uh if if something was called Little Women I would would suspect that it might be like a romantic comedy or something</u>
<u n="102" who="S0037">yeah it is a bit floppy</u>
<u n="103" who="S0115">um no but I I don't romantic comedies</u>
<u n="104" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it's one of those classics though</u>
<u n="105" who="S0115">I think we were talking about them a couple of days ago actually</u>
<u n="106" who="S0037">yeah Bridget Jones</u>
<u n="107" who="S0115">you're you you <trunc>th</trunc> you don't like um <pause dur="short"/> you don't like them do you?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> no but I mean</u>
<u n="109" who="S0115">is that what Little Women is? What's it about?</u>

<u n="111" who="S0115">alright <pause dur="short"/> fight the carpet-baggers <pause dur="short"/> what side was he on?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0037">uh I don't know <pause dur="short"/> but they like do various things like <pause dur="short"/> there's like one of them who wants to be a writer and she goes off to the city to be a writer and then <pause dur="short"/> oh there's a man who lives next door and he likes them but they don't like him oh but just just</u>
<u n="113" who="S0115" trans="overlap">oh I think I'm gonna find myself uh slipping slipping into</u>
<u n="114" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it's like a  it's like a  Jane <trunc>Auste</trunc> no no no that's the end of the story <pause dur="short"/> it's like a Jane Austen-esque but not as exciting I suppose</u>
<u n="115" who="S0115" trans="overlap"><unclear/> Oh right</u>
<u n="116" who="S0037">but anyway it's um <pause dur="short"/> went to see that and <pause dur="short"/> but yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I didn't go to the cinema very much <pause dur="short"/> didn't really</u>
<u n="117" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I went uh I went for a bit like I got <trunc>b</trunc> uh taken got taken by my parents a bit when uh when I was in like</u>
<u n="118" who="S0037">I went on a like a date once to the cinema</u>
<u n="119" who="S0115">ha ha</u>
<u n="120" who="S0037">and I remember thinking it was the stupidest place to go because like</u>
<u n="121" who="S0115">well <pause dur="short"/> yeah it is yeah it's <trunc>i</trunc> it's one of the probably most common like child child date destinations innit?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it's so bad and stupid <pause dur="short"/> but I was like fifteen or whatever <pause dur="short"/> and I went to see you know Liar Liar with Jim Carey</u>
<u n="123" who="S0115">yeah yeah that's a  that's a  sort of typical</u>
<u n="124" who="S0037" trans="overlap">was quite a good film actually</u>
<u n="125" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0037">but it's just like <pause dur="short"/> well it's totally pointless <pause dur="short"/> you may as well just sit on your own for an <trunc>ho</trunc> two hours <pause dur="short"/> it is entirely pointless</u>
<u n="127" who="S0115" trans="overlap">but it is a bit silly actually isn't it cos you basically just sit next to each other</u>
<u n="128" who="S0037" trans="overlap">you should never go to the cinema with anyone that you like because there's no point <pause dur="short"/> it's like you can <trunc>ha</trunc> you can't speak to them you can't see them <pause dur="short"/> if you whisper something to them everyone else gets pissed off</u>
<u n="129" who="S0115" trans="overlap">people do though don't they they always go looking for like</u>
<u n="130" who="S0037" trans="overlap">like when we watch films I'm always like hey <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> so is that the guy that's done this that's done that? or What's happened then? What's happened now? Like you can't do any of that at the cinema cos you piss everyone else off</u>
<u n="131" who="S0115"><vocal desc="laugh"/> No I think my favourite way to watch a film would be yeah to like to be able to talk through it and like pause it and like</u>
<u n="132" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> rewind it yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0115">yeah <pause dur="short"/> let's watch this bit <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah definitely let's watch this bit again like <pause dur="short"/> and uh and in that bar I was talking about like you know my favourite  my favourite  bar in the world you know the the</u>
<u n="134" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah in Berlin</u>
<u n="135" who="S0115">there was next to it was a room called that they called the Multikulti <trunc>Rau</trunc> Room</u>
<u n="136" who="S0037">right</u>
<u n="137" who="S0115">and they would put they <trunc>l</trunc> they would screen films and you can do exactly that like</u>
<u n="138" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0115">it not only is the best bar in the world but also has like</u>
<u n="140" who="S0037">best cinema in the world</u>
<u n="141" who="S0115">like a <trunc>ver</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> a good cinema where you could sort of <pause dur="short"/> I think the best for me like it's all about like the best the best bar the best cinema is about like you can do what you want with it you know like</u>
<u n="142" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I've quite</u>
<u n="143" who="S0115" trans="overlap">it's about  it's about  allowing people to do <pause dur="short"/> it's about giving people the <trunc>op</trunc> the power and opportunity to do what they want</u>
<u n="144" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0115">and uh and a lot of that doesn't happen in uh in bars and cinemas like you're kind of stuck in like</u>
<u n="146" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no that's true</u>
<u n="147" who="S0115">yeah with a cinema you're kind of stuck there aren't you?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0037" trans="overlap">Cos like <pause dur="short"/> and like you know going to the loo is due you know in two hours it's natural that you would wanna at least pop to the loo once <pause dur="short"/> and like that's why it's sort of</u>
<u n="149" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah I mean it it's if your mates you would wanna get you and your mates uh quite a few of them and then just watch a <trunc>s</trunc> a film like that you know in in one of your houses like and that's the sort of thing</u>
<u n="150" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0115">problem is like there's a bit of an incentive to yeah getting talking about economics again but uh there's a bit of an incentive in the economy to to to against that you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0115">what is at? Fifteen? Have we done fifteen?</u>
<u n="154" who="S0037">nine</u>
<u n="155" who="S0115">oh <pause dur="short"/> uh there's a bit of an incentive against doing things yourself at home um and in favour of spending more money <trunc>bec</trunc> because of the need for for more  for more  growth and more money in the economy so that like maybe people like the kinds of bars I was talking about they're not <trunc>parti</trunc> not particularly profitable</u>
<u n="156" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no no</u>
<u n="157" who="S0115">in terms of the economy</u>
<u n="158" who="S0037">well</u>
<u n="159" who="S0115">um <pause dur="short"/> and a lot of that the bar thing would have an element of cash-in-hand-ness about it and I think it did <pause dur="short"/> you know you when when you were saying you'd keep some of the profits <trunc>f</trunc> for yourself like  the <trunc>c</trunc>  = the <trunc>c</trunc> the cinema screening thing that I was talking about was like that was free so there was no money in that so that economically speaking they you know the government might wanna  might wanna  <trunc>di</trunc> dissuade people from doing that</u>
<u n="160" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0115">from spending their time without spending money you know what I mean</u>
<u n="162" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0115">uh and also in the bar yeah I think you would take the money for the beers and you were allowed to keep a certain share of the profit and clearly that clearly that's cash in hand like I think you're not you're you're unlikely to uh I think</u>
<u n="164" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah pay tax on that and everything</u>
<u n="165" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I I <trunc>t</trunc> I I'm not  I'm not  sure but I I imagine that you would collect all the money up and then like</u>
<u n="166" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0115">I think you would <pause dur="short"/> no I <trunc>do</trunc> I don't know actually I I suppose it's it's it would surely possibly be illegal to uh</u>
<u n="168" who="S0037">well I don't know</u>
<u n="169" who="S0115">to uh I just felt like it was like</u>
<u n="170" who="S0037">maybe if it's a private institution like maybe it's</u>
