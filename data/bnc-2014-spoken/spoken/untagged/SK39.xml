<u n="305" who="S0183">mm hm</u>

<u n="308" who="S0180">so for them it's more important</u>

<u n="320" who="S0180">well you didn't know at the time you didn't? Well do you think it was useful to get both of them? The NHS and the NCT classes?</u>
<u n="321" who="S0183">I felt  I felt  a lot better with the information</u>
<u n="322" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="323" who="S0183">I didn't <trunc>partic</trunc> I didn't go there to make friends</u>
<u n="324" who="S0180">no</u>
<u n="325" who="S0183">I went there for the information</u>
<u n="326" who="S0180">well yes I think other people in the group went there to make friends didn't they?</u>
<u n="327" who="S0183">mm hm</u>
<u n="328" who="S0180">em</u>
<u n="329" who="S0183">because you know as much as you read books you still get a different set of information when you attend a class</u>
<u n="330" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="331" who="S0183">you know with the teacher and all?</u>
<u n="332" who="S0180">well that's right <pause dur="short"/> I mean em I mean it was useful but em yeah I mean just because you're in the same group as people you don't have to just cos you don't  you don't  necessarily hit it off with them <pause dur="short"/> I mean the men were alright but then I wouldn't say that they're that chatty or you know <pause dur="short"/> I mean I find the New Zealand and Australians generally a bit macho the men</u>
<u n="333" who="S0183">mm</u>
<u n="334" who="S0180">and if you don't sort of join in the banter without beer drinking and all that <pause dur="short"/> which a lot of British people can be like that as well but you know em then you're not not excluded but oh <pause dur="short"/> but em you're not excluded but what I'm I trying to say? I mean there's no there's certain superficial conversation around beer you know and all that sort of stuff <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="335" who="S0183">oh you know</u>
<u n="336" who="S0180">they're okay <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't say em I'll be best buddies within the year but eh</u>
<u n="337" who="S0183">mm no I don't think <pause dur="short"/> I just think and also after they all go back to work will they still keep in touch?</u>
<u n="338" who="S0180">that's it <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I don't think that <pause dur="short"/> I don't think it's important for the men either <pause dur="short"/> cos we're all working presumably and when I have time off do they want to be meeting up? Not really <pause dur="short"/> well I wouldn't say well I wouldn't personally</u>
<u n="339" who="S0183">and also don't they have the other friends that they need to you know entertain?</u>
<u n="340" who="S0180">oh that's right</u>
<u n="341" who="S0183">I mean I don't I can't be bothered <pause dur="short"/> I mean you know</u>
<u n="342" who="S0180">that's fine though <pause dur="short"/> em</u>
<u n="343" who="S0183">I don't know I don't feel like I should pressure myself into thinking</u>
<u n="344" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's</u>
<u n="345" who="S0183">I need to be friends with them</u>
<u n="346" who="S0180">that's like when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said oh see you in two weeks or something <pause dur="short"/> I thought two weeks? What do they mean by that?</u>
<u n="347" who="S0183">I mean cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> doesn't work</u>
<u n="348" who="S0180">yes</u>
<u n="349" who="S0183">she can't work</u>
<u n="350" who="S0180">right</u>
<u n="351" who="S0183">and she's only moved here for two years so she's usually you know wanting to make friends and meet people and</u>
<u n="352" who="S0180">well yeah cos it was interesting that she came there to these glasses after having a child already you'd think they were for people who haven't had children yet</u>
<u n="353" who="S0183">mm hm</u>
<u n="354" who="S0180">but she's had a child and she didn't have them for her it's definitely where they're meeting people isn't it?</u>
<u n="355" who="S0183">and also she knew she was gonna have a caesarean</u>
<u n="356" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's right</u>
<u n="357" who="S0183">em</u>
<u n="358" who="S0180">well yes a double reason really for not going to NCT classes isn't it?</u>
<u n="359" who="S0183">mm hm</u>
<u n="360" who="S0180">because but so yeah she was obviously there which is fine <pause dur="short"/> you know some people do want to make friends in those classes <pause dur="short"/> but eh it's not for everyone is it? Em</u>
<u n="361" who="S0183">no that's right</u>
<u n="362" who="S0180">yeah but em <pause dur="short"/> that man's got strange glasses hasn't he? He looks a bit like a Richard O'Brien from the crystal maze</u>
<u n="363" who="S0183">mm</u>
<u n="364" who="S0180">these super super fashionable glasses <pause dur="short"/> you're right about the baby glasses cos I saw a child this morning in a pram with these silly plastic glasses on that didn't look as though they had lenses in and I think I thought are the parents putting them on as a fashion statement?</u>
<u n="365" who="S0183">no they're real glasses</u>
<u n="366" who="S0180">really?</u>
<u n="367" who="S0183">to correct their sight</u>
<u n="368" who="S0180">but how do they know if the child's sight needs correcting at that young age?</u>
<u n="369" who="S0183">I don't know</u>
<u n="370" who="S0180">it's ridiculous</u>
<u n="371" who="S0183">maybe they went to opticians and</u>
<u n="372" who="S0180">no but <pause dur="short"/> when the child's growing up when it's a toddler you need to give it time for its eyes to grow into its you know face</u>
<u n="373" who="S0183" trans="overlap">I don't know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="374" who="S0180">I only needed glasses when I was fourteen</u>
<u n="375" who="S0183">I know <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what they're thinking they're probably thinking they're correcting it them now</u>
<u n="376" who="S0180">but that's so stupid <pause dur="short"/> when did you start wearing glasses?</u>
<u n="377" who="S0183">about fourteen as well</u>
<u n="378" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so on average I think it's when you are just entering the teenage years is when most people</u>
<u n="379" who="S0183">mm</u>
<u n="380" who="S0180">and you can you know you can articulate that you need glasses <pause dur="short"/> because you're sitting at the back of the classroom squinting at the blackboard or something</u>
<u n="381" who="S0183">mm hm</u>
<u n="382" who="S0180">but em if you're a toddler you can't say I need glasses can you?</u>
<u n="383" who="S0183">mm <pause dur="short"/> shall we bath him tonight or not?</u>
<u n="384" who="S0180">I don't know I think he's he's out for the count at the moment isn't he? So em let's see if it gets to nine and he wakes up em I'll bath him if not we can go straight to bed but when did we last bath him?</u>
<u n="385" who="S0183">not yesterday maybe the day before?</u>
<u n="386" who="S0180">it was the day before yesterday? Okay <pause dur="short"/> we should give him a bath <pause dur="short"/> now look at that car on the program <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> em on the program that would be perfect for London because they're like a little it's like a little minivan and the Japanese experts at em compactness aren't they? That will be perfect for parking in London streets and you can still get four or five six people in there with some luggage at the back <pause dur="short"/> they really know how to design in a compact way now <pause dur="short"/> if you look at cars in London now these stupid Chelsea tractors</u>
<u n="387" who="S0183">mm</u>
<u n="388" who="S0180">but you know I mean they're not London streets are not designed for them are they? They just get in the way</u>
<u n="389" who="S0183">no <pause dur="short"/> em I was going to say</u>
<u n="390" who="S0180">why don't Japanese companies sell these sort of cars here?</u>
<u n="391" who="S0183">I think they are going to aren't they? Cos em</u>

<u n="452" who="S0180">so what what what are the main storylines generally? What do they tend to be about?</u>
<u n="453" who="S0183">they tend to be just about families and you know in in all of that they'll be <pause dur="short"/> in the ones I watch anyway there's lots of different genres <pause dur="short"/> but the ones I watch tend to be about families</u>
<u n="454" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="455" who="S0183">and within the families they'll be like arguments or arguing about money arguing about eh inheritance say but <pause dur="short"/> and then in in all of that they'll be em romance there's always gonna be a romance <pause dur="short"/> it might be a <trunc>tr</trunc> a love triangle or things or something like that em</u>
<u n="456" who="S0180">A lot of them seem to deal with these em like small companies or something</u>
<u n="457" who="S0183">yeah or</u>
<u n="458" who="S0180">it seems to be a continuous theme from my casual observation of it like a small business</u>
<u n="459" who="S0183">yeah like say eh you know  you know  someone just got the job and they've got this really difficult task to do</u>
<u n="460" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="461" who="S0183">and it's like an impossible task then always someone comes along to help them which in reality won't happen of course</u>
<u n="462" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="463" who="S0183">but it's not</u>
<u n="464" who="S0180">like a fairy godmother type?</u>
<u n="465" who="S0183">yeah it's always like a fairy godmother type but you know no no one takes these series as real obviously no one thinks that they're realistic</u>
<u n="466" who="S0180">no</u>
<u n="467" who="S0183">or believe in or you know like <pause dur="short"/> it is actually a bit very fairy tale like <pause dur="short"/> like this man he's helping this woman unconditionally you know</u>
<u n="468" who="S0180">so as a <trunc>c</trunc> as a  as a  comparison maybe it compares with Neighbours?</u>
<u n="469" who="S0183">no</u>
<u n="470" who="S0180">is it less or more serious?</u>
<u n="471" who="S0183">it's even less serious</u>
<u n="472" who="S0180">it's even less serious than Neighbours?</u>
<u n="473" who="S0183">yeah</u>
<u n="474" who="S0180">right</u>
<u n="475" who="S0183">it's it's just fantasy really</u>
<u n="476" who="S0180">right</u>
<u n="477" who="S0183">which even though it plays out like</u>
<u n="478" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="479" who="S0183">or or normal everyday life <pause dur="short"/> is is it's just about</u>
<u n="480" who="S0180">more cartoonish?</u>
<u n="481" who="S0183">it is actually <pause dur="short"/> it is very cartoonish because because <vocal desc="laugh"/> it plays out it's just impossible</u>
<u n="482" who="S0180">do you think psychologically it appeals to what Hong Kong people want their situations to be? Or is it total escapism?</u>
<u n="483" who="S0183">I think it's just total escapism</u>
<u n="484" who="S0180">okay <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="485" who="S0183">Hong Kong people are too realistic for that</u>
<u n="486" who="S0180">are they?</u>
<u n="487" who="S0183">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean even if you you know if you watch any <trunc>y</trunc> you know none of them are real you know none of them because in terms of the time scale <pause dur="short"/> I mean okay let's not put a time to it you know in terms of what happens but you know people and their attitude like it's not  it's not  meant to be real and em</u>
<u n="488" who="S0180">so what who is the target audience? Is it very much housewives?</u>

<u n="511" who="S0183">and then we would watch all the series and it was only seven and eight <pause dur="short"/> so and then and so it's targeted at young people really <pause dur="short"/> really really young people and teenagers you know</u>
<u n="512" who="S0180">right</u>
<u n="513" who="S0183">it's because it's the teenagers who becomes fans of these uprising stars you know <pause dur="short"/> so and then these stars you know they'd be like these stars will be singers as well and then they'll be fan clubs and things</u>
<u n="514" who="S0180">you can do a PHD on <pause dur="short"/> no I'm serious <pause dur="short"/> you can do a PHD on TVB series the appeal of them and you can go around interviewing people</u>

<u n="517" who="S0183">well I'm off to</u>
<u n="518" who="S0180">that's if you've done sociology</u>
<u n="519" who="S0183">well it's quite interesting because a few years ago I met this girl who was gonna have a year's experience at at the TVB at the moment at the time which was only one studio</u>
<u n="520" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="521" who="S0183">non non paying they'd just be working I was really happy to go there</u>
<u n="522" who="S0180">voluntary</u>
<u n="523" who="S0183">voluntary <pause dur="short"/> but now recently there's another em cos it TVB has a had a monopoly?</u>
<u n="524" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="525" who="S0183">on like</u>
<u n="526" who="S0180">on soap operas</u>
<u n="527" who="S0183">on soap operas and they did have a years ago they did have another eh rival but they didn't  they didn't</u>
<u n="528" who="S0180">but they can't be the only channel who makes soap operas in Hong Kong? Are they?</u>
<u n="529" who="S0183">ah I think they might be <pause dur="short"/> I mean for while they might be but let me finish <pause dur="short"/> cos I was saying a few years ago there was this em eh the rival em studio and they produced em series as well and but they weren't very popular</u>
<u n="530" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="531" who="S0183">and they were buying these big stars from TVB</u>
<u n="532" who="S0180">I see</u>
<u n="533" who="S0183">and this this the series was not not very good or</u>
<u n="534" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="535" who="S0183">it wasn't very popular and then they started promoting these stars uprising stars that weren't even good looking and</u>
<u n="536" who="S0180">right</u>
<u n="537" who="S0183">eh I think they went bankrupt anyway <pause dur="short"/> and then em now I think there's lots of these TV series TV studios opening up</u>
<u n="538" who="S0180">right you mean private ones? So it's been deregulated?</u>
<u n="539" who="S0183">I think so  I think so  and then now they are then in talks with these real established stars to come over <pause dur="short"/> or it could be a <trunc>s</trunc> situation where I don't know whether you know this em in Hollywood on the nineteen twenty thirty forties em a star was had a seven year contract with one studio</u>
<u n="540" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="541" who="S0183">and they're not allowed to make any films</u>
