<u n="1" who="S0041">tread water <pause dur="short"/> that's fine <pause dur="short"/> I can do that</u>
<u n="2" who="S0084">so you just have to tread water for twenty minutes?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0041">swim for twenty minutes and then tread water for three</u>
<u n="4" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="5" who="S0041">that's easy <pause dur="short"/> so basically the issue here is the long distance running and the sit-ups</u>
<u n="6" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="7" who="S0041">and the fact that <vocal desc="laugh"/> I've got to knock another two minutes off my time</u>
<u n="8" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so really when do you so by the time you go and do your fitness in five weeks you need to be running at thirteen minutes?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> I need to be running at about fourteen <pause dur="short"/> but my fitness won't be in five weeks <pause dur="short"/> it'll be a minimum of six weeks <pause dur="short"/> very very minimum</u>
<u n="10" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="11" who="S0041">from now <pause dur="short"/> so I've got six weeks <pause dur="short"/> I've already been training for six weeks</u>
<u n="12" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0041">so just six seven weeks</u>
<u n="14" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's definitely feasible</u>
<u n="15" who="S0041">I could I <trunc>de</trunc> I reckon I could lose a minute in six weeks</u>
<u n="16" who="S0084">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> it's definitely feasible</u>
<u n="17" who="S0041">imagine if I'd not started doing this in January?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh man</u>
<u n="19" who="S0041">can you imagine if right now oh it's getting a bit closer I've passed my recruit test I should start training now?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I mean it's amazing how quickly your body copes with things like that <pause dur="short"/> you'd have to be training every day though wouldn't you</u>
<u n="21" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0084">you'd have to go every single day</u>
<u n="23" who="S0041">and your legs'd think your probably legs'd just fall off</u>
<u n="24" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="25" who="S0041">you'd just wake up one morning and you'd be legless <pause dur="short"/> not the good way</u>
<u n="26" who="S0084">legless <pause dur="short"/> and your heart might explode</u>
<u n="27" who="S0041">yes <pause dur="short"/> that's also an option</u>
<u n="28" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's a tough one <pause dur="short"/> well I mean it'll be worth it in the long run <pause dur="short"/> I suppose that's the idea about pushing yourself so much <pause dur="short"/> presumably that's why people do it <pause dur="short"/> I would <unclear/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0041">I've just sent <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> a message but it didn't save <pause dur="short"/> that's annoying <pause dur="short"/> I hope it went</u>
<u n="30" who="S0084"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> is he misbehaving?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0041">I hope so <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I just said um <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> should be okay I think <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="32" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">oh <pause dur="short"/> bugger <pause dur="short"/> it's cold</u>
<u n="33" who="S0041">freezing <pause dur="short"/> yep <pause dur="short"/> fact <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> to be honest I train most days during the week <pause dur="short"/> managed to get my run down to five O five</u>
<u n="34" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> let me know if you're free one daytime</u>
<u n="36" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0041">basically that's it <pause dur="short"/> I'm not  I'm not  being the person that he can easily see as an afterthought when he's got a a bit of spare time during the week <pause dur="short"/> he can fuck off</u>
<u n="38" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">love you <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="39" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="41" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="42" who="S0041">love you</u>
<u n="43" who="S0084">hm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so sod that</u>
<u n="45" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0041">fuck that for a game of soldiers <pause dur="short"/> and if he wants to spend his weekends travelling to <anon type="place"/> then go for it <pause dur="short"/> cos by the sounds of it</u>
<u n="47" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/> But then I put another wristband <unclear/></u>
<u n="48" who="S0041">this girl's a massive limp lettuce</u>
<u n="49" who="S0084">yep <pause dur="short"/> oh definitely</u>
<u n="50" who="S0041">she's twenty-six and she's still working at uni <pause dur="short"/> well fucking great <pause dur="short"/> and I tell you what <pause dur="short"/> if he has a a nice easy life with her then fantastic <pause dur="short"/> five years time he's gonna be bored to fuck</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">I was gonna say</u>
<u n="52" who="S0041">and he won't have achieved anything</u>
<u n="53" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's not gonna be <trunc>g</trunc> it doesn't sound like it's anything that's gonna be going anywhere <pause dur="short"/> like in the short-term it's probably quite the appeal is that it's different to what he had with you</u>
<u n="54" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0084">but that's nothing that's gonna keep him there and interested long-term</u>
<u n="56" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> definitely not</u>
<u n="57" who="S0084">and if she were living here it might be a very different story</u>
<u n="58" who="S0041">I bet if she was living here he'd get bored of her very quickly</u>
<u n="59" who="S0084">I can definitely say that's true</u>
<u n="60" who="S0041">like it's all lovely now cos she's <trunc>g</trunc> they're <trunc>ba</trunc> he goes there and he <trunc>t</trunc> she takes him to gigs</u>
<u n="61" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="62" who="S0041">Cos she gets to go at the student union</u>
<u n="63" who="S0084">oh nice</u>
<u n="64" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so they went to see <anon type="place"/> and somebody else or something</u>
<u n="65" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="66" who="S0041">either way <pause dur="short"/> if she'd not got that privilege do you think she'd be buying him tickets to see stuff? No I don't think so</u>
<u n="67" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0041">and do you think he he'd be so excited to go there? No <pause dur="short"/> probably not</u>
<u n="69" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0041">so</u>
<u n="71" who="S0084">oh huh <pause dur="short"/> she's blackmailing him</u>
<u n="72" who="S0041">yep <pause dur="short"/> blackmailing him and then he's gonna feel sorry for her cos she's so fat</u>
<u n="73" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and and boring</u>
<u n="74" who="S0041">and which makes me <trunc>s</trunc> do you know I hate  I hate saying that I hate  saying that cos that's one thing that I always think that if you're gonna insult someone don't go for the below the belt shot</u>
<u n="75" who="S0084"><vocal desc="yawn"/></u>
<u n="76" who="S0041">have the fat comment <pause dur="short"/> but it makes me feel better right now <pause dur="short"/> so huh <pause dur="short"/> whilst she can't actually physically hear it then</u>
<u n="77" who="S0084">well I mean and</u>
<u n="78" who="S0041">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> doesn't know it then</u>
<u n="79" who="S0084">and the anger isn't directed at her <pause dur="short"/> like er your frustration is that he's interested in someone like her <pause dur="short"/> but your anger isn't at her <pause dur="short"/> it's at him</u>
<u n="80" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0084">for being a douchebag <pause dur="short"/> because she is er by the by and totally inconsequential</u>
<u n="82" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0084">and</u>
<u n="84" who="S0041">and at least she's not hot</u>
<u n="85" who="S0084">she's not <pause dur="short"/> it'd be much worse</u>
<u n="86" who="S0041">can you imagine if he walked <trunc>r</trunc> walked round with a stunner on his arm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0084">well <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I have this conversation all the time</u>
<u n="88" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="89" who="S0084">all the time <pause dur="short"/> because of my two serious ex-boyfriends <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and the first um serious boyfriend <pause dur="short"/> he ended up with someone who was a complete troll <pause dur="short"/> who I detested and who I knew <pause dur="short"/> and I knew he was after her <trunc>w</trunc> when we were together <pause dur="short"/> and I broke up with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> it ended quite badly <pause dur="short"/> and he got together with this</u>
<u n="90" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="91" who="S0084">girl who is fat and horrible <pause dur="short"/> and I just hated her</u>
<u n="92" who="S0041">huh</u>
<u n="93" who="S0084">absolutely detested each other at college <pause dur="short"/> she is a complete cowbag <pause dur="short"/> and er just <trunc>sl</trunc> slept her way through our group of friends <pause dur="short"/> like she was just known as the group bike <pause dur="short"/> basically everyone had shagged her <pause dur="short"/> and um and she just really like a <trunc>m</trunc> massive knob <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean? Like no one had any time for her <pause dur="short"/> he got together with her and then they moved in together <pause dur="short"/> and they were together for about four years I think</u>
<u n="94" who="S0041">huh</u>
<u n="95" who="S0084">but they broke up last year</u>
<u n="96" who="S0041">Good</u>
<u n="97" who="S0084">and I said well at least she's a hound</u>
<u n="98" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0084">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said no no no no because it's a reflection on you <pause dur="short"/> like you'd want</u>
<u n="100" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0084">you'd want them to go for someone hot because then it means that they find hot women what you perceive to be hot attractive</u>
<u n="102" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0084">and therefore you know that you're hot <pause dur="short"/> cos then <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> obviously bit of a dickhead at the time but got together with this girl <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> who was I consider to be very attractive <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> big boobs <pause dur="short"/> um pretty face <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> could cook <pause dur="short"/> is quite homely</u>
<u n="104" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0084">all these types of things <pause dur="short"/> and I always used to compare myself to her <pause dur="short"/> but I  but I  knew we were very different <pause dur="short"/> but she is hot <pause dur="short"/> she's what I would <trunc>c</trunc> consider to be quite attractive <pause dur="short"/> and er typically his type <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> brunette <pause dur="short"/> quite curvy <pause dur="short"/> and that had got boobs <pause dur="short"/> and I  and I  knew that he that'd be his type <pause dur="short"/> so it's quite hard <pause dur="short"/> like I think I don't wanna think of <trunc>hi</trunc> of anyone that I've been with to be with someone hotter than me <pause dur="short"/> cos you don't wanna think they're comparing you <pause dur="short"/> but at the same time</u>
<u n="106" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0084">like you don't wanna think that their taste is munters</u>
<u n="108" who="S0041">well that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> do you know this'll</u>
<u n="109" who="S0084">so</u>
<u n="110" who="S0041">make me sound awful but I kind of thought well apart from Tom who's gonna be biased because it's his girlfriend's friend</u>
<u n="111" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0041">and he must still think it anyway <pause dur="short"/> is that I don't want him introducing this fatty to his friends who you know has you know similar length hair to me similar colour <pause dur="short"/> I'm not a small person <pause dur="short"/> you know I don't want them to think oh well er he obviously goes for you know chubby blondes</u>
<u n="113" who="S0084">you're completely different though <pause dur="short"/> you look completely different <pause dur="short"/> you've got  you've got  a completely different style haven't you <pause dur="short"/> like she <trunc>d</trunc> she doesn't wear er high heels from what you were saying <pause dur="short"/> like she's not feminine at all</u>
<u n="114" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="115" who="S0084">whereas you very much are <pause dur="short"/> like if they met her they would see that she's completely different to you</u>
<u n="116" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0084">I mean obviously all girls have a similar look in the sense that they've all got boobs and a vajayjay</u>
<u n="118" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="119" who="S0084">do you know what I mean? Like I don't think they would compare the two of you <pause dur="short"/> and I <trunc>th</trunc> maybe that's as I say part of the appeal</u>
<u n="120" who="S0041">freaking hope not <pause dur="short"/> that's partially why I wanted to see <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> I know it sounds awful and it makes me sound really shallow <pause dur="short"/> but I just wanted to do a bit of parading</u>
<u n="121" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0041">Cos last time he saw me <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>h</trunc> how big were? I was  I was  the same weight but a very different size <pause dur="short"/> I was like how I was when I moved in here</u>
<u n="123" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> your body shape</u>
<u n="124" who="S0041">so I wanted</u>
<u n="125" who="S0084">your body shape has changed a lot hasn't it <pause dur="short"/> you know I mean have you seen that?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0041">I wanted to parade</u>
<u n="127" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="129" who="S0084">no it has <pause dur="short"/> it really has <pause dur="short"/> you look completely different</u>
<u n="130" who="S0041">I can see my waist more now <pause dur="short"/> my waist's longer</u>
<u n="131" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> no you have changed shape <pause dur="short"/> definitely</u>
<u n="132" who="S0041">I wanted to parade</u>
<u n="133" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="134" who="S0041">so that there was no comparison between us</u>
<u n="135" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="136" who="S0041">at all <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="137" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0041">which makes me sound shallow but I don't care <pause dur="short"/> I still wanted to do it</u>
<u n="139" who="S0084">well at this point you know it's huh there's no rule book <pause dur="short"/> there's nothing to say you can or can't do this <pause dur="short"/> I mean</u>
<u n="140" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0084">you're sort of making it up as you go along <pause dur="short"/> because invariably people don't stay friends with their exes for this very reason <pause dur="short"/> cos it's very difficult <pause dur="short"/> very painful</u>
<u n="142" who="S0041">and seeing as if you do say something you don't get a reply</u>
<u n="143" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0041">I'm just sending a message saying has <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> gone road or rogue or did you actually get that message? Cos it's not going to my save er items sent items</u>

<u n="543" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> dunno <pause dur="short"/> just thought I was investigating volunteering possibilities in the city and there aren't really an awful lot <pause dur="short"/> like I thought oh you could like go and read to kids in school and stuff like that <pause dur="short"/> but can't really do that <pause dur="short"/> um although our our company give you seven hours a year so like one day a year to go and <trunc>s</trunc> spend a day volunteering <pause dur="short"/> doing something <pause dur="short"/> like you can have</u>
<u n="544" who="S0041">wow</u>
<u n="545" who="S0084">you can basically choose what you wanna do <pause dur="short"/> um but it'd be quite nice if you could do it more often <pause dur="short"/> um but like my our operations boss <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> whose birthday it was last week she's gonna do a project with the Romsey Mill</u>
<u n="546" who="S0041">oh yeah</u>
<u n="547" who="S0084">all the um teenage girls they're gonna um they're gonna take photos and make um a magazine front cover <pause dur="short"/> cos obviously er <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> can</u>
<u n="548" who="S0041">wow</u>
<u n="549" who="S0084">take her Mac and take along like all the software programs that we use like InDesign and put the photos in there <pause dur="short"/> and mock up a spread or a front cover for a magazine <pause dur="short"/> they can you know they can do whatever they like <pause dur="short"/> and then bring it into the <trunc>w</trunc> into the office and print them out <pause dur="short"/> cos we've got a super duper whizzy lovely one printer <pause dur="short"/> um and they can actually keep copies <pause dur="short"/> so she said she's gonna volunteer and do that <pause dur="short"/> cos they're one of  they're one of  our registered charities <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="550" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="551" who="S0084">it's quite a good idea <pause dur="short"/> but I think</u>
<u n="552" who="S0041">that is a nice thing to do</u>
<u n="553" who="S0084">the thing about <anon type="place"/> is you have to like if you get the nightshift you have to sleep on the sofa there overnight with them</u>
<u n="554" who="S0041">what?</u>
<u n="555" who="S0084">kind of a bit freaky <pause dur="short"/> like you either there's three shifts <pause dur="short"/> either you do the breakfast shift <pause dur="short"/> so you go in at like half six and go and make breakfast for everybody <pause dur="short"/> there's <trunc>twe</trunc> if it's full there's twenty people like sleeping there at any one time <pause dur="short"/> like <unclear/></u>
<u n="556" who="S0041">twenty people?</u>
<u n="557" who="S0084">like homeless people <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> they've got eighteen beds for blokes and two beds for women <pause dur="short"/> which at the time I was like <trunc>wh</trunc> why is that? And they were saying well predominantly it's you find there's more men on the streets than women</u>
<u n="558" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="559" who="S0084">and they they put it down to like the break up of the home <pause dur="short"/> um they're saying like you know if a husband and wife break up and they've got kids like it'll always pretty much be expected that the man will move out</u>
<u n="560" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="561" who="S0084">and if he has a bit of a break down of like <trunc>s</trunc> events spiral out of control <pause dur="short"/> like he might get a bit depressed <pause dur="short"/> he might not be able to go into work <pause dur="short"/> he might lose his job <pause dur="short"/> and then he hasn't got any money <pause dur="short"/> and all of a sudden <pause dur="short"/> he's too proud to ask for help</u>
<u n="562" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="563" who="S0084">before you know it it's like a really slippery slope <pause dur="short"/> and then once you're on the streets you can't get another job cos you haven't got an address and you don't ask for help <pause dur="short"/> I think women are much more um able to do that <pause dur="short"/> so you do just and actually when she said that I thought well yeah no you do mainly see men don't you</u>
<u n="564" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="565" who="S0084">you don't see a lot of women <pause dur="short"/> so yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I dunno <pause dur="short"/> it's hard</u>
<u n="566" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I I think it would freak me out too much</u>
<u n="567" who="S0084">I think the idea of it's probably worse than it actually  it actually  is like</u>
<u n="568" who="S0041">I'd just be scared of people that are on drugs</u>
<u n="569" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> although I mean obviously they've got very strict rules <pause dur="short"/> if they found out that anybody brought it onto the the site they'd be out instantly</u>
<u n="570" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="571" who="S0084">but um yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean you just don't know <pause dur="short"/> and if you</u>
<u n="572" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's my only problem <pause dur="short"/> the drug thing</u>
<u n="573" who="S0084">if you sleep there you've gotta sleep on the sofa <pause dur="short"/> which is out in the open <pause dur="short"/> like the er dormitory block on the side <pause dur="short"/> um but to get out and cross the room to the toilets they've gotta come into your space <pause dur="short"/> and there's always night people there <pause dur="short"/> like there's always <trunc>sta</trunc> cos you're a volunteer but there are extra paid staff <pause dur="short"/> and there's always someone sat in their little office <pause dur="short"/> but it's locked <pause dur="short"/> and it's got like bulletproof glass <pause dur="short"/> and they're they're behind the screen <pause dur="short"/> and I think God if anything</u>

<u n="577" who="S0084">with the crazies</u>
<u n="578" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I'm sure they're not all crazy <pause dur="short"/> but the risk of sleeping anywhere with a group of strangers</u>

<u n="582" who="S0041">you know <pause dur="short"/> freaks me out</u>
<u n="583" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it is hard <pause dur="short"/> cos you do sort of you get to a point where you think well I wanna  I wanna  do something <pause dur="short"/> I wanna give something back <pause dur="short"/> but it's finding the right thing</u>
<u n="584" who="S0041">mm</u>

<u n="699" who="S0041">that's really good</u>
<u n="700" who="S0084">I really  I really  would recommend it <pause dur="short"/> I mean the thing is actually it's quite sad because the fourth series is the last series <pause dur="short"/> and obviously it's set in the trenches <pause dur="short"/> and it's all very funny like darkly comic</u>
<u n="701" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="702" who="S0084">and the last episode in the every episode they're basically trying to find a way of getting out of being in the trenches <pause dur="short"/> like that's the idea in every episode <pause dur="short"/> I think there's eight <pause dur="short"/> blackadder's trying to find a way to get out <pause dur="short"/> he doesn't wanna die <pause dur="short"/> he really</u>
<u n="703" who="S0041">right</u>
<u n="704" who="S0084">wants to live quite badly <pause dur="short"/> doesn't wanna go over the top <pause dur="short"/> certainly doesn't wanna go out into no man's land <pause dur="short"/> certainly doesn't wanna get shot <pause dur="short"/> so in every episode he's trying to find a way out <pause dur="short"/> until the last episode <pause dur="short"/> and he thinks he's done it <pause dur="short"/> he thinks he's found a way out by acting mad <pause dur="short"/> but then he realizes it's it's it's not gonna work <pause dur="short"/> he's gonna have to go over the top <pause dur="short"/> and er and they do and they blow all their whistles and they go over the top <pause dur="short"/> and then you just see like footage of the men like coming over the top of the trenches <pause dur="short"/> and it's all in slow motion <pause dur="short"/> I don't really like slow motion but it's really powerful <pause dur="short"/> it's really poignant <pause dur="short"/> and um</u>
<u n="705" who="S0041">do you know I might have seen somebody talk about this on the TV before</u>
<u n="706" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="707" who="S0041">and then play that clip</u>
<u n="708" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and it's <trunc>re</trunc> it really brings tears to your eyes <pause dur="short"/> but obviously because it all just makes it so real <pause dur="short"/> because you knew that they were doing that <pause dur="short"/> boys were coming out of the trench into the cannons <pause dur="short"/> and then you know millions died in these fields <pause dur="short"/> and er they play like slow music over the <trunc>t</trunc> they play the theme tune but really slowly</u>
<u n="709" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="710" who="S0084">and er then then it all just fades</u>
<u n="711" who="S0041">I have heard it before</u>

<u n="713" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="714" who="S0084">because er I think because up to that point you don't  you don't  see it coming <pause dur="short"/> like the first time you watch it you think oh it's really funny  it's really funny  They're gonna get out <pause dur="short"/> of course they're gonna get out  they're gonna get out</u>
<u n="715" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="716" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> and they don't</u>
<u n="717" who="S0041">I think it was a programme about black humour I watched</u>

<u n="722" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean it is very very strange <pause dur="short"/> very daft <pause dur="short"/> I suppose <pause dur="short"/> but um it's worth  it's worth  a watch because I just think it's so clever <pause dur="short"/> it's so well done <pause dur="short"/> um that I think anyone should watch it really</u>

<u n="724" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="725" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> and I didn't really get it <pause dur="short"/> like I didn't find it funny at all <pause dur="short"/> whereas daft humour we're talking Drop Dead Fred and Bottom</u>

<u n="732" who="S0084">you're not  you're not  gonna have it all not everyone's gonna have the same sense of humour</u>
<u n="733" who="S0041">well it's <trunc>abou</trunc> it's the same type of comedy isn't it <pause dur="short"/> same type</u>

<u n="736" who="S0084">you yeah well that's that's what you like <pause dur="short"/> I mean the black humour obviously is is quite different I think <pause dur="short"/> cos it's like I think the Mighty Boosh draws from that <pause dur="short"/> that sort of silly silly humour <pause dur="short"/> but it's also so off the wall <pause dur="short"/> so obscure <pause dur="short"/> so abstract <pause dur="short"/> like it's it's sort of pushing those boundaries I think <pause dur="short"/> and now that he's done that stupid like</u>
<u n="737" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="738" who="S0084">luxury Comedy I think you know</u>

<u n="740" who="S0084">you're just being a twat now <pause dur="short"/> no one  no one  gives a fuck about you <pause dur="short"/> okay Regency era was eighteen eleven to eighteen twenty <pause dur="short"/> so it was pre-Victoria</u>
<u n="741" who="S0041">well done you</u>
<u n="742" who="S0084">well <pause dur="short"/> so it was turn of the century <pause dur="short"/> just not the nineteenth <trunc>centu</trunc> no it was the nineteenth century not the twentieth century <pause dur="short"/> actually I might've said that <pause dur="short"/> but yeah basically my my history is sort of earlier and then later</u>
<u n="743" who="S0041">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> I've none <pause dur="short"/> I have literally Egypt <pause dur="short"/> tudors <pause dur="short"/> romans</u>

<u n="750" who="S0084">I think it's probably the stuff that you learn at school though isn't it <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean? Like you probably don't go into that much detail of the cold war till <trunc>lat</trunc> until you do your GCSEs <pause dur="short"/> and if you haven't chosen to do history</u>
<u n="751" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="752" who="S0084">then you wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> you probably wouldn't study it</u>
<u n="753" who="S0041">and I moved schools as well so</u>
<u n="754" who="S0084">there's probably gaps there</u>
<u n="755" who="S0041">I completely missed like they were studying the Aztecs in the secondary school <pause dur="short"/> whereas I was studying like er dunno Tudors or something <pause dur="short"/> and as I moved</u>
<u n="756" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="757" who="S0041">they were studying Tudors again</u>

<u n="764" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="765" who="S0041">really bad</u>
<u n="766" who="S0084">that's that's the danger with the curriculum <pause dur="short"/> that you know it is open to um an interpretation at each of the schools that you're at so</u>
<u n="767" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="768" who="S0084">so yeah that is quite hard</u>

<u n="1073" who="S0084">then Alfred the Great <pause dur="short"/> edward the Elder <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> anyway anyway anyway <pause dur="short"/> so basically this has probably got Cromwell on here <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so after the Tudors</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0084">then you had the Stuarts <pause dur="short"/> which was Elizabeth the first</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> completely missed that</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> so Elizabeth the first was the first Stuart</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0084">but I dunno why <pause dur="short"/> because she never got married <pause dur="short"/> I dunno how she's classed as the first Stuart <pause dur="short"/> but it must be something to do with her line from the Boleyn line <pause dur="short"/> cos obviously she's Anna Boleyn's daughter</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0084">so it must be something to do with where she comes from <pause dur="short"/> as opposed to <pause dur="short"/> cos obviously her dad is Henry the eighth <pause dur="short"/> and he was a Tudor</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0084">so why she's a Stuart I don't know <pause dur="short"/> but at that point after her James the <trunc>f</trunc></u>
<u n="1084" who="S0041">Anne Boleyn's German?</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0084">huh? She's Stuart</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0041">Anne Boleyn</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0084">Anne Boleyn</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0041">oh Berlin <pause dur="short"/> that's where I was going with that</u>

<u n="1090" who="S0084">she's not German <pause dur="short"/> well I mean er she might be <pause dur="short"/> think I dunno  I dunno  if she's German</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0041">okay <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> I'm with it now <pause dur="short"/> I'm with it</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0084">yep <pause dur="short"/> so then you had all the Jameses <pause dur="short"/> so you had Elizabeth the first <pause dur="short"/> then</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0084">James the first <pause dur="short"/> who came after <pause dur="short"/> who was</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0084">some descendant of Mary <pause dur="short"/> cos obviously Mary at that point had gone mental</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0041">did he not last very long?</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0084">he didn't last very long either <pause dur="short"/> and he <trunc>w</trunc> he tried to unite Scotland as well</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oo yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0084">he was James the sixth of Scotland but James the first of England</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0084">it's all a bit confusing</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0041">is that Robin Hood?</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0084">that's not Robin Hood</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0041">do you think that's?</u>
<u n="1106" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="1107" who="S0041">oh <pause dur="short"/> damn it</u>
<u n="1108" who="S0084">that's definitely not Robin Hood <pause dur="short"/> then there was his son <pause dur="short"/> which is Charles the first <pause dur="short"/> now he was the one who was beheaded <pause dur="short"/> he was because he was a complete despot and then he dismissed Parliament <pause dur="short"/> and he just wanted to run the country himself <pause dur="short"/> and so all of you lot can fuck off</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0041">right</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0084">I'm the king <pause dur="short"/> you will do what I say</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0084">and people went</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0041">and everyone said no</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0084">that's very interesting <pause dur="short"/> goodbye <pause dur="short"/> give us your head</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0041">God says this</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so then he went <pause dur="short"/> they chopped his head off <pause dur="short"/> they had a trial that wasn't really a trial <pause dur="short"/> chopped his head off <pause dur="short"/> and buried him <pause dur="short"/> oliver Cromwell became oh I always want to say mother superior <pause dur="short"/> it's not mother superior</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1118" who="S0084">it's something  it's something  like that <pause dur="short"/> he was essentially he he essentially ran the country <pause dur="short"/> and but he was a  he was a  Puritan</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0041">right</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0084">like to the point where I think he used to flagellate self-<trunc>flage</trunc></u>
<u n="1121" who="S0041">puritan?</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> tut <pause dur="short"/> huh <pause dur="short"/> it's a type of Anglican er Christianity <pause dur="short"/> so it's not  it's not  from the Pope <pause dur="short"/> it's not Catholic <pause dur="short"/> it's far more right than than that <pause dur="short"/> like it's really you can't there's certain food that you can't eat <pause dur="short"/> you can't do certain things on the Sabbath day <pause dur="short"/> like it's it's religion to the extreme</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0041">to the extreme</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so he so the people got really annoyed with him <pause dur="short"/> cos they're like you're you're also maybe a bit mental as well <pause dur="short"/> so goodbye to you <pause dur="short"/> and then at the same time Charles the first who had his head beheaded his son was had had to flee when he was a boy <pause dur="short"/> and he'd been hiding out in Scotland</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0041">right</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0084">his son came back <pause dur="short"/> claimed the throne <pause dur="short"/> dug his dad up with his missing <vocal desc="laugh"/> head</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0041">what?</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> had and then had a ceremony for him and then reburied him <pause dur="short"/> and he chopped and he dug up do you know who he dug up? He dug up Oliver Cromwell <pause dur="short"/> chopped his head off when he was dead and put it on a spike um outside the palace <pause dur="short"/> as a fuck you <pause dur="short"/> because that's what they did</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0084">to Charles the first</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0084">all pretty gruesome <pause dur="short"/> then you had um James the second <pause dur="short"/> who was Charles's son <pause dur="short"/> and then it becomes a bit weird <pause dur="short"/> and you get these people from um Holland <pause dur="short"/> william and Mary and Anne and some other degenerates <pause dur="short"/> that's all about the seventeen hundreds</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0041">I don't know anything about those lot</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0084">I don't really know anything about that lot either <pause dur="short"/> how do I? Right so that takes you up to seventeen hundreds <pause dur="short"/> now we need the second list <pause dur="short"/> timeline <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> so at that point then you've got all the Georges <pause dur="short"/> which is the Hanover line <pause dur="short"/> which is this <trunc>ho</trunc> Dutch line <pause dur="short"/> then then the Germans come into it <pause dur="short"/> cos they all start having they they're all <trunc>int</trunc> intermarry</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0041">right</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0084">this is all the bit that I don't really know <pause dur="short"/> so you've got all the Georges <pause dur="short"/> another William <pause dur="short"/> and then it's Victoria <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> Um and then yeah <pause dur="short"/> so she dies nineteen O one <pause dur="short"/> then it's Edward the seventh <pause dur="short"/> for <trunc>qu</trunc> <trunc>qu</trunc> quite a long time according to this <pause dur="short"/> oh maybe about oh no no not a long time <pause dur="short"/> is that ten years then? Oh that's ten years <pause dur="short"/> so in nineteen thirty-nine possibly Edward the eighth er George so what do you think that means then? Like when does George the fifth come in? And when does Edward the eighth? Cos George the fifth is obviously Edward the eighth's dad</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0084">it's weird isn't it <pause dur="short"/> george the fifth must've come in at the end of Edward the eighth's reign er</u>

<u n="1363" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0084">do you know what I mean? If she'd walked away <pause dur="short"/> if she'd absolute cos er she was on the edge</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0084">she was frazzled <pause dur="short"/> if she'd kicked off surely Robin would've just said right fine well</u>

<u n="1368" who="S0084">you know as we can't keep this booking</u>

<u n="1381" who="S0041">he would <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so basically I think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got the gist of the story <pause dur="short"/> cos obviously she wasn't there <pause dur="short"/> but um <vocal desc="cough"/> you know he started kicking off <pause dur="short"/> and I just said look <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> that's not obviously that's not what I intended but I think</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0041">the best thing in this situation for you to do is talk to <anon type="name" nameType="n"/></u>
<u n="1384" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0041">he overheard me talking and basically saved my bacon <pause dur="short"/> and you know if it's stepping on toes then I don't know what to say other than speak to him <pause dur="short"/> it will all they're all in wrong <pause dur="short"/> I said well to be honest I don't know how to correct them <pause dur="short"/> or if they are in wrong <pause dur="short"/> cos I haven't got a clue <pause dur="short"/> you know it's not something that's part of my job <pause dur="short"/> and if <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> has put something in wrong that pisses you off I suggest you talk to him</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1387" who="S0041">and he was like but you know I came back from my lunch and you could've even told me <pause dur="short"/> you couldn't have even said to me that oh by the way we've sorted it and we've done this</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0041">I thought no I couldn't cos er you would've if if you wanted to do that</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0041">or if you had any intention of it you could've done it before then when I asked you in the first place</u>
<u n="1392" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> bell-end</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0041">so er I mean in the end Eve actually had to say <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I think you should kind of bring extract yourself from this conversation now <pause dur="short"/> even in front of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> cos I think you're not gonna get anywhere <pause dur="short"/> you know it's best if <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> just take it with <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> <pause dur="short"/> and I just thought oh my God <pause dur="short"/> for the sake of a hundred quid</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0084">oh it's just massive egos isn't it <pause dur="short"/> essentially that's all it is <pause dur="short"/> his ego's</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0084">been bruised</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="1398" who="S0084">he wants to think that he's running the show</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0084">and at the end of the day and he probably he he knows he's been caught out <pause dur="short"/> he knows that you know that he could've given you a better deal</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0084">he could've actually been a bit more helpful other than <unclear/> can do</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0041">well seeing how extreme that situation was</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0041">and he didn't do anything about it</u>
<u n="1406" who="S0084">in any business you've gotta make a call haven't you <pause dur="short"/> like a huh a <trunc>l</trunc> a less extreme version a less extreme example when I worked at Waterstones for example <pause dur="short"/> it'd be our policy not to do any returns outside of the twenty-eight day um exchange period or <pause dur="short"/> someone came in and were really kicking off <pause dur="short"/> just for the sake of what? A few quid? You'd just be like right fine <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> whatever <pause dur="short"/> do whatever you want <pause dur="short"/> of course we'll do you an exchange <pause dur="short"/> you think cos you wanna keep your customers happy <pause dur="short"/> you <trunc>wa</trunc> you know you particularly something like a wedding <pause dur="short"/> and they're spending</u>
<u n="1407" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0084">so much money <pause dur="short"/> and he's just think what is the matter with you? Like why are you so tight about this?</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and it's like he's it's coming out of his own pocket</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's er <trunc>co</trunc> it's just like he's he's read the rule book and he's taking it literally</u>
<u n="1411" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="1412" who="S0084">like there's no sort of grey area with him</u>
<u n="1413" who="S0041">but he bends it for he bends it <pause dur="short"/> all the time <pause dur="short"/> just not on this occasion <pause dur="short"/> like there's been times when basically we take a group booking it's contracted <pause dur="short"/> they're liable for bedrooms even if they don't take them</u>
<u n="1414" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0041">which with us on conference he's really strict with <pause dur="short"/> but I overheard him to Sarah earlier today</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0041">and she had a group booking the twenty rooms and they took one</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0041">and they didn't charge cos they're a corporate client that they didn't wanna piss off <pause dur="short"/> and I was like well er wedding woman that I don't wanna piss off cos I don't fancy getting that in the face next week thanks</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> absolutely <pause dur="short"/> so is it just that he's not being helpful towards you do you think? Is it personal?</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0041">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> it wouldn't surprise me <pause dur="short"/> after all the other things that have gone on</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0041">but God knows <pause dur="short"/> but basically <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> had said as he did it <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> knew that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was being a knob</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0041">and Simon and I both knew <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was being a knob <pause dur="short"/> which is why we both kind of just kept it quiet and just said agreed for <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> to do it <pause dur="short"/> I knew when he was doing it it was wrong</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0041">um but he said basically <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is very strict on what bedroom rates he offers <pause dur="short"/> however there's a new kind of scheme coming into play <unclear/> next week which is being trialed <pause dur="short"/> which basically will take that power away from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="1428" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0041">on conference bookings <pause dur="short"/> so they'll they'll give us a framework which basically says if the total booking is worth say one grand two grand three grand four grand then the the minimum acceptable bedroom rate is <trunc>l</trunc> like lower and lower as the price of the booking gets higher</u>
