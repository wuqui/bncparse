<u n="2" who="S0014">yeah <pause dur="short"/> every yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean I think the other option is we stay here and I take redundancy and then probably take a lower paid job <pause dur="short"/> but we might be happier because we're here <pause dur="short"/> but erm we haven't really talked about it like properly in terms of we need to make a decision now <pause dur="short"/> at the moment it's just kind of well er these are our options</u>
<u n="3" who="S0018">what shall we do? What shall we do?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0014" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="5" who="S0018">it's a difficult one though isn't it?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0014">I know <pause dur="short"/> it is like quality of life versus like money really I guess</u>
<u n="7" who="S0018" trans="overlap">exactly <pause dur="short"/> but not only I think it's the pace of life in London too</u>
<u n="8" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0018">I mean I</u>
<u n="10" who="S0014">I think if it had been ten years ago we would have both said yeah let's do it <pause dur="short"/> thank you <pause dur="short"/> cheers <pause dur="short"/> but yeah like now we're in our thirties we don't really want to make that kind of move really</u>
<u n="11" who="S0018">how I mean how far out of London can you live so that it's not actually really London living?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0014">erm it depends like basically the BBC will give me a relocation package</u>
<u n="13" who="S0018">oh yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0014">so they'd help me sell my house and help finance a move <pause dur="short"/> but if I did that I'd have to live within a thirty mile radius of where I'd be working which is central London</u>
<u n="15" who="S0018">oh right</u>
<u n="16" who="S0014">so I could say no I don't want any financial help <pause dur="short"/> I'll do it myself and then I could live wherever I wanted</u>
<u n="17" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0014">and then I thought well I could commute it from <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> but then I thought well I could probably do it for a couple of months <pause dur="short"/> thanks but er that would take its toll I think</u>
<u n="19" who="S0018">would you miss <anon type="place"/>? Do you actually like living here?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0014">erm well all my friends are here <pause dur="short"/> and I think it's just ideal because it's not far from my mum and dad <pause dur="short"/> they're an hour away <pause dur="short"/> my friends are all here</u>

<u n="28" who="S0014">mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0018">oh I guess cos London's more east to the east isn't it</u>

<u n="115" who="S0018">but there's a lot of things that England has that Spain doesn't</u>

<u n="118" who="S0014">all the time</u>
<u n="119" who="S0018">it is really nice <pause dur="short"/> another good thing about Spain is that it's always there</u>

<u n="124" who="S0018">just to feel the sun like this for example this morning if it was like this every day <pause dur="short"/> it's just the light and the warmth</u>
<u n="125" who="S0014">how how did you find the winter then that must have been tough</u>
<u n="126" who="S0018">well it <trunc>w</trunc> it wasn't too bad because it has been quite a mild winter</u>
<u n="127" who="S0014">mm</u>
<u n="128" who="S0018">when I got into December I was thinking I can handle this <pause dur="short"/> I can handle this <pause dur="short"/> and then I started going to everybody oh I'm alright <pause dur="short"/> I can handle British winters <pause dur="short"/> and they were like this is not a British winter <pause dur="short"/> this is the mildest it has been for years <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="129" who="S0014">mm <pause dur="short"/> you should have been here the winter before <pause dur="short"/> you would not have survived</u>
<u n="130" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> But you know little by little <pause dur="short"/> see how it ends up</u>

<u n="132" who="S0018">no actually I've not <pause dur="short"/> well obviously because I was doing the PGCE I was teaching Spanish</u>
<u n="133" who="S0014" trans="overlap">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="134" who="S0018">so I was still kind of thinking about it but I mean teaching Spanish at secondary school</u>
<u n="135" who="S0014">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="136" who="S0018">there's not much teaching or Spanish involved <pause dur="short"/> it's more like sit down <pause dur="short"/> stop trying to body slam him in the corner</u>
<u n="137" who="S0014">oh God</u>
<u n="138" who="S0018">come on sit down</u>
<u n="139" who="S0014">oh my God</u>
<u n="140" who="S0018">sit down <pause dur="short"/> am I gonna have to put you on report? Okay you in the other corner <pause dur="short"/> stop <pause dur="short"/> stop jabbing the pencil up his nose <pause dur="short"/> health and safety issues</u>
<u n="141" who="S0014"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Does does anyone want to learn?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0018">um <pause dur="short"/> there were a few kids in each class that were actually you could see they were very sparky and you could engage them</u>
<u n="143" who="S0014" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="144" who="S0018">but the thing is once you've engaged the kids that you know are open to it</u>
<u n="145" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0018">you've got all the ones that are playing up and have got anger management issues or</u>
<u n="147" who="S0014">God</u>
<u n="148" who="S0018">visual impairment <pause dur="short"/> or hearing impairment or</u>
<u n="149" who="S0014">that sounds really tough</u>
<u n="150" who="S0018">it is tough because you're dealing with so many variables in the one class</u>
<u n="151" who="S0014">mm</u>
<u n="152" who="S0018">that er as soon as you've engaged one of the groups you lose all the others <pause dur="short"/> and then it's like forever juggling <pause dur="short"/> and it wasn't that er I don't know I I seem to remember my classes when I was at secondary school <pause dur="short"/> because we were streamed they were a lot more homogeneous</u>
<u n="153" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0018">so it was only really a handful of naughty boys that used to distract the class</u>
<u n="155" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0018">but in the schools that I've seen and the schools that you know my colleagues were telling me it's it's not it's now it's only a handful of kids that you can actually work you know teach</u>
<u n="157" who="S0014" trans="overlap">oh God</u>
<u n="158" who="S0018">and it's the rest it's all crowd control and <pause dur="short"/> it's sole destroying <pause dur="short"/> it really is</u>
<u n="159" who="S0014">do you think you'll go back to it?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> it is my back up plan</u>
<u n="161" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0018">I mean having done the training in inner city <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's not really a microcosm of all the schools that exist</u>
<u n="163" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0018">I'm sure that there are schools that that you don't have to handle that amount of misbehaviour and <pause dur="short"/> but I don't know <pause dur="short"/> if I find a job working with adults I think I'd much prefer doing that</u>
<u n="165" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0018">and cos I'm <trunc>learn</trunc> I'm targeting like erm English Language Teaching <pause dur="short"/> publishing and</u>
<u n="167" who="S0014">oh okay</u>
<u n="168" who="S0018">that's why a lot of the jobs are coming up are in Oxford</u>
<u n="169" who="S0014">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0018">I think if you're targeting publishing it's Oxford Cambridge or London really</u>
<u n="171" who="S0014" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="172" who="S0018">erm <pause dur="short"/> so we'll see what happens <pause dur="short"/> I've just heard that I haven't got an interview for one of the jobs I went for</u>
<u n="173" who="S0014">okay</u>
<u n="174" who="S0018">but that was I think quite normal because I phoned the guy in Human Resources and asked him about this particular job that I couldn't work out whether it was in Oxford or Madrid <pause dur="short"/> and it ended up that it was in Madrid</u>
<u n="175" who="S0018" trans="overlap">but I kind of took that opportunity to just quickly tell him my experience and ask him a bit of advice</u>
<u n="176" who="S0014" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0018">and he was like look you know just because it says we require sales and marketing experience</u>
<u n="178" who="S0014">mm</u>
<u n="179" who="S0018">if there's one or two things on the requirements list that you don't have send your CV in anyway because</u>
<u n="180" who="S0014">okay</u>
<u n="181" who="S0018">you never know <pause dur="short"/> so it was one of those situations</u>
<u n="182" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="183" who="S0018">I didn't  I didn't  think that I think I might have got an interview had they only had like three people</u>
<u n="184" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="185" who="S0018">ha ha but I don't think in this day and age they only get three people</u>
<u n="186" who="S0014">no that's true <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> mm</u>
<u n="187" who="S0018">applying <pause dur="short"/> I think they get three hundred people applying for the</u>
<u n="188" who="S0014">mm <pause dur="short"/> what about teaching in sixth forms? Or do you still need to do the whole PGCE thing for that?</u>
<u n="189" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="190" who="S0014">do you?</u>
<u n="191" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="192" who="S0014">oh</u>
<u n="193" who="S0018">I did er teach in sixth form too because there were erm most schools nowadays have their own little sixth form</u>
<u n="194" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="195" who="S0018">and it was generally nicer because they were smaller classes</u>
<u n="196" who="S0014">and they wanna be there don't they I guess?</u>
<u n="197" who="S0018">they still don't wanna be there</u>
<u n="198" who="S0014">oh don't they?</u>
<u n="199" who="S0018">no no no no</u>

<u n="206" who="S0014">want to learn</u>
<u n="207" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean there were a couple of very good students in that class <pause dur="short"/> but again it's it's such a shame that you you're distracted from the very good students by the ones who er just disrupt everything</u>
<u n="208" who="S0014" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> god</u>
<u n="209" who="S0018">it's such a shame <pause dur="short"/> it really is</u>
<u n="210" who="S0014" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="212" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="213" who="S0018">effectively not because I'm an effective teacher but because the <trunc>s</trunc> the students that I've had have been you know obviously there's always kids are always gonna act up a little bit aren't they but</u>
<u n="214" who="S0014">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="215" who="S0018">these kids were at least motivated to be there <pause dur="short"/> because you could I found a lot that my personality in the classroom would motivate them</u>
<u n="216" who="S0014">okay</u>
<u n="217" who="S0018">because if you're energetic and enthusiastic</u>
<u n="218" who="S0014">mm</u>
<u n="219" who="S0018">and you know you make them laugh and you get them to do the work</u>
<u n="220" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="221" who="S0018">and you get them to see that they can actually do it <pause dur="short"/> and all those things together motivates them to continue and motivates them to progress</u>
<u n="222" who="S0014" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="223" who="S0018">but if you go into a secondary school class of thirty kids who don't want to be there <pause dur="short"/> who have no idea</u>
<u n="224" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="225" who="S0018">why learning languages would be important <pause dur="short"/> erm if you go in there with an enthusiastic bubbly personality all positive and la la la okay how are you? Rar rar rar rar cmo estÃ¡s hoy? They just sit there and think oh what is she doing?</u>
<u n="226" who="S0014"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>

<u n="228" who="S0014">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="229" who="S0018">and then you've just started off completely on the wrong foot with them</u>
<u n="230" who="S0014">God <pause dur="short"/> cos it's difficult to know how to kind of sort of kind of take it then</u>
<u n="231" who="S0018">well you just have to be really disciplinarian and serious</u>
<u n="232" who="S0014">mm</u>
<u n="233" who="S0018">gage the class and maybe ease off on the whole seriousness</u>
<u n="234" who="S0014">mm <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>

<u n="236" who="S0014">hmm</u>
<u n="237" who="S0018">it really is <pause dur="short"/> so yeah if I don't' find anything else I'll finish the course at least</u>
<u n="238" who="S0014">yeah <pause dur="short"/> would you have to start again or can you?</u>
<u n="239" who="S0018">no I'd only have to take it up from January</u>
<u n="240" who="S0014">oh that's good</u>
<u n="241" who="S0018">the stuff I've already done counts</u>
<u n="242" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="243" who="S0018">but I think it was a bad time for me to do it really cos I I'd just I pretty much had a year of full on intense work</u>
<u n="244" who="S0014">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="245" who="S0018">without without holidays and went straight from you know full on intense work in Spain to the day that I finished my job I moved back to England <pause dur="short"/> I moved all my life back to England and then the day after I moved my life back to England I started</u>
<u n="246" who="S0014">oh my God</u>
<u n="247" who="S0018">I know so I think maybe with a bit more</u>
<u n="248" who="S0014">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it might be easier this time then because you've had a bit of mental space as well and</u>
<u n="249" who="S0018" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> and the whole adapting to another culture cos</u>
<u n="250" who="S0014">mm</u>
<u n="251" who="S0018">England has changed so much since I left <pause dur="short"/> it is kind of like coming back to a foreign country in a way</u>
<u n="252" who="S0014">is it? God mm</u>
<u n="253" who="S0018">but you'll probably get that if you move to London as well</u>
<u n="254" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="255" who="S0018">it's like a different country <pause dur="short"/> a really different way of living <pause dur="short"/> a different rhythm</u>
<u n="256" who="S0014" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> cos I've I've gone I've lived there twice <pause dur="short"/> just like short term for work <pause dur="short"/> like the first time I I did it for eight months and the second time was for three months <pause dur="short"/> and both times there was nothing that kept me there <pause dur="short"/> I I just felt like I wanted to come back <pause dur="short"/> I just felt like I I'm earning the same money as that in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> but it's not going as far</u>
<u n="257" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="258" who="S0014">and I'm working longer hours <pause dur="short"/> just commuting all the time <pause dur="short"/> and I just thought I don't' really get the benefits of working here at all</u>
<u n="259" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> will they readjust your salary to London weighting?</u>
<u n="260" who="S0014">yeah they would <pause dur="short"/> though but that's only like three thousand five hundred on top <pause dur="short"/> which is still good but</u>
<u n="261" who="S0018">it doesn't reflect the</u>
<u n="262" who="S0014">it doesn't cover kind of you know tube fares and</u>
<u n="263" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="264" who="S0014">and all that</u>
<u n="265" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> and now the government are trying to pay people less than other places that's</u>
<u n="266" who="S0014" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's a bit crazy</u>
<u n="267" who="S0018">it is crazy <pause dur="short"/> especially when you consider that you know when you're shopping for food and when you're buying petrol</u>
<u n="268" who="S0014">mm</u>
<u n="269" who="S0018">and when you're paying the rent and pay like paying bills and stuff it's not significantly</u>
<u n="270" who="S0014">yeah</u>
<u n="271" who="S0018">cheaper in the areas that they wanna pay people minimum wages</u>
<u n="272" who="S0014">yeah yeah I know</u>
<u n="273" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> it sounds really dodge <pause dur="short"/> do you want some more soup?</u>

<u n="275" who="S0018">there's loads left</u>

<u n="277" who="S0018">ah</u>
<u n="278" who="S0014">so I can look into erm redeployment and and see if there's any work in Salford <pause dur="short"/> so that's another option which it's kind of maybe like a happy medium really <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="279" who="S0018">yeah?</u>
<u n="280" who="S0014">it's a bit more like <anon type="place"/> there <pause dur="short"/> not so expensive to live <pause dur="short"/> and Matt's seen some jobs there that he wouldn't mind applying for</u>
<u n="281" who="S0018">what kind of things is he looking for?</u>

<u n="294" who="S0018">mm</u>

<u n="629" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="630" who="S0014">he doesn't want to <pause dur="short"/> and I just think if I do want to get married soon I'm probably gonna have to back down on that cos I'm not going to convince him otherwise</u>
<u n="631" who="S0018">what is it you want about a Catholic church marriage?</u>
<u n="632" who="S0014">just because I dunno it's more of childhood thing <pause dur="short"/> like I just wanted to get married in the church I've always gone to and I still go to when I go back to Hereford and stuff and</u>
