<u n="442" who="S0589">yeah but then why they're timed differently you would have thought</u>
<u n="443" who="S0590">you'd think they would have put two and two together</u>
<u n="444" who="S0589" trans="overlap">the metrics say</u>
<u n="445" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="446" who="S0589"><anon type="place"/> maybe not the fact that you might be <trunc>c</trunc> travelling together</u>

<u n="459" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but er we'll we'll be well and truly ready by twelve erm because as I say the I think they'll need every minute of it <pause dur="short"/> yeah but er the I mean they they've obviously planned it so that people arrive for embarking er without too much waiting around although there is apparently a lounge with with er you know coffee and drinks and whatever you want actually</u>
<u n="460" who="S0589">but if you don't make it the boat sails on</u>

<u n="463" who="S0590">yeah they they'd have to wouldn't they? yeah <pause dur="long"/> I mean I'm well aware of the fact that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who build in <trunc>cond</trunc> even more than I do actually they were going to the Isle of Wight</u>
<u n="464" who="S0589">uhu</u>

<u n="468" who="S0589">blimey</u>
<u n="469" who="S0590">they completely missed it because they were they were erm gridlocked in their car they were taking their car across the Isle of Wight as well the reason being that there were two big cruise ships these are two four thousand passengers things and if you've got something like seven eight thousand passengers disembarking</u>
<u n="470" who="S0589">uhu</u>
<u n="471" who="S0590">and moving out of Southampton at the same as seven or eight thousand are embarking you really have a major problem in Southampton <pause dur="short"/> and the ridiculous situation is that the only way you can get from the harbour out of Southampton is on road which is quite crazy because you know there there is a possible train link that they could actually take people out of the environment of Southampton like a sort of park and ride on a rather grand scale <pause dur="short"/> well <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I have to say that <trunc>l</trunc>lamb</u>
