<u n="6" who="S0262">but is that a well-known college that's the reason why for education that you both went there? or is it because there was more location in terms of near to home or?</u>

<u n="15" who="S0262">it might have been they would have had hockey sticks</u>
<u n="16" who="S0299">you would have thought so erm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0262">and this is it here this is the <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> an old pupil of <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0299">yes</u>

<u n="24" who="S0299">yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0262">which is funny because my first proper teaching position I suppose erm was in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0299">oh</u>
<u n="27" who="S0262">not far really from <anon type="place"/> at all</u>
<u n="28" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="29" who="S0262">and actually strangely the college in <anon type="place"/> which is the the teaching college well the teaching college further education college sorry erm I call it a teaching college because I did my my postgraduate erm diploma in education while I was there</u>
<u n="30" who="S0299">yes I see yes</u>
<u n="31" who="S0262">they made you do it</u>
<u n="32" who="S0299">mmhmm yes</u>
<u n="33" who="S0262">I mean it was a good thing to do but it was to get you on to the next rung of the salary</u>
<u n="34" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes oh yes yes</u>
<u n="35" who="S0262">that's the way they got you in</u>
<u n="36" who="S0299" trans="overlap">that's right yes</u>
<u n="37" who="S0262">you know but I I worked there for two years so I actually was living in <anon type="place"/> erm just outside of <anon type="place"/> ten minutes down the road from mum and dad and then I would commute each day up to <anon type="place"/> and the college of <anon type="place"/> also has a college in <anon type="place"/> which is actually getting bigger now erm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="39" who="S0262">so the whole connection though</u>
<u n="40" who="S0299">it's amazing isn't it? yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0262" trans="overlap">really it is you know in way I know <anon type="place"/> is a sort of focal point for the family but erm just how <trunc>sh</trunc>she would have been there I don't know she would have been there from <pause dur="short"/> gosh I suppose</u>
<u n="42" who="S0299">well I went sixty-four to sixty-seven and she left in sixty she left in sixty-four</u>
<u n="43" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0299">so three years that would be sixty-two sixty-one</u>
<u n="45" who="S0262" trans="overlap">sixty-four yeah yeah well I mean she had <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> in seventy so she had me in seventy-three so she would have been there maybe in <anon type="place"/> for I don't think she did it for long I think she might have done it eighteen months or so</u>
<u n="46" who="S0299" trans="overlap">oh so your brother was born seventy</u>
<u n="47" who="S0262">yeah and so and she met mum er dad in erm well they got married in sixty <pause dur="long"/> sixty</u>
<u n="48" who="S0299">oh sixty oh no</u>
<u n="49" who="S0262">they must have got married in sixty <pause dur="short"/> eight I think that would make sense</u>
<u n="50" who="S0299">so was your brother born abroad?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0262">mm mm he was born in <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="52" who="S0299">oh that's</u>
<u n="53" who="S0262">they were posted up there so</u>
<u n="54" who="S0299">I see</u>
<u n="55" who="S0262">so funny because really you know I was born in England I was born in <anon type="place"/> dad was born in <anon type="place"/> but he's really an Irish has an Irish family</u>
<u n="56" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="57" who="S0262">erm and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was born in <anon type="place"/> and mum obviously was born in Wales so really the four of us kind of have a quite a Celtic you know</u>
<u n="58" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes very much yes</u>
<u n="59" who="S0262">represent represent you know the Celtic so erm yeah it's interesting how how that turned out to be the case but yeah <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> lives and works in London erm he has done for a number of years so</u>
<u n="60" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="61" who="S0262">and that's my my grandmother there yeah <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>

<u n="64" who="S0299" trans="overlap">so your <trunc>mo</trunc> your mother looks like her mother doesn't she?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0262">yeah yeah yes but I suppose there must be some resemblance to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I would imagine</u>
<u n="66" who="S0299">I can't see it</u>
<u n="67" who="S0262">can't see it no</u>
<u n="68" who="S0299"><unclear/> no</u>
<u n="69" who="S0262">I you see I <trunc>nev</trunc> well I I think I met him I wasn't entirely sure I might have met him once erm granny took me down to erm <anon type="place"/> when I was about nineteen and to see a friend of hers and it it might have been that we stopped off to see <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="70" who="S0299">yes yeah</u>
<u n="71" who="S0262">but that's a very hazy memory for me it's not something that I really recall very well so</u>
<u n="72" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes <pause dur="short"/> yes yes</u>
<u n="73" who="S0262">you know other than that I might have met <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> once as a little girl erm it's possible that I met him but again I don't have a recollection of that</u>
<u n="74" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes no yeah yeah so oh</u>
<u n="75" who="S0262">you know so he really remains quite a</u>
<u n="76" who="S0299">a mystery</u>
<u n="77" who="S0262">he does really</u>
<u n="78" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes well he is yeah I recognise this as <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="79" who="S0262">and he's much less of a mystery now that I know a bit more about mum <vocal desc="laugh"/> I didn't quite realise you know the er the significance of all of this you know</u>
<u n="80" who="S0299">well it was amazing cos I didn't know about er <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> my mother <trunc>w</trunc> called her erm until I went for my interview I went for an interview erm to <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="81" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0299">and this woman said to me are you expecting any mail? and I actually thought she meant M A L E</u>
<u n="83" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0299">I kind of looked at her I said no and she said oh cos there's some registered mail there's a notice on the noticeboard you know that they had for students saying registered mail for miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> well obviously she didn't know that miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> although it wasn't a big college and I told my mother about this and she said oh that's your father's daughter <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="85" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="long"/> no <pause dur="long"/>  right okay yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0299">and I didn't so I didn't know until I was eighteen that my father had a daughter and the fact that we went to the same college</u>
<u n="87" who="S0262" trans="overlap">right ok <pause dur="long"/>yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0299">but she so she was there when I had my interview but she left</u>
<u n="89" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="90" who="S0299">and it was that man where she's got the group photograph there</u>
<u n="91" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0299">a Mr er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> er well he was the education lecturer</u>
<u n="93" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="94" who="S0299">and I did erm so it was divided into the education was infants junior secondary so she and I both did</u>
<u n="95" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low">secondary</u>
<u n="96" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0299">and he said oh you anything belonging to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> so I said no because in those days if I if he might have said well how</u>
<u n="98" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0299">and the fact that my mother wasn't married was such a scandal so I just said oh no I think he said do you know her? so I quite honestly could say no</u>
<u n="100" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah said no I don't know her yeah yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0299">I don't but it was amazing that we should be in the same group</u>
<u n="102" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0299">and I don't know perhaps she didn't do she's got RE there oh she did geography</u>
<u n="104" who="S0262">she did geography she did English and she did something else which was a bit erm sort of like home economics or</u>
<u n="105" who="S0299">oh well you all had to do you had to do certain things were everybody had to do</u>
<u n="106" who="S0262" trans="overlap">right okay something like that yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0299">yes but my main subject was RE</u>
<u n="108" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="109" who="S0299">whereas hers might have been geography</u>
<u n="110" who="S0262">yeah I think it was</u>
<u n="111" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="112" who="S0262">so how much younger are you then than my than my mum?</u>
<u n="113" who="S0299">right I don't really I can't remember I did know I was born in nineteen forty-five</u>
<u n="114" who="S0262">yeah so she was born in forty-three</u>
<u n="115" who="S0299">forty-three yes it's just two two years</u>
<u n="116" who="S0262">yeah that would explain why you were at college kind of at about the same time yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0299" trans="overlap">and your mother's <pause dur="short"/> that's right yes cos she she was born in the January wasn't she?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0299">and I was born in the October</u>
<u n="120" who="S0262">that's no mum was born in December</u>
<u n="121" who="S0299" trans="overlap">oh December oh December I see</u>
<u n="122" who="S0262" trans="overlap">December tenth yeah yeah so yes yes so you're your birthday is this month?</u>
<u n="123" who="S0299">yes yes so so it was really quite incredible and then oh it was some time later and then there was a chap called <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> your dad might have told you about</u>
<u n="124" who="S0262">oh yes I've heard all about him</u>
<u n="125" who="S0299"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> there's a cake and biscuits there</u>
<u n="126" who="S0262" trans="overlap">in fact I've the <trunc>la</trunc> the latest oh thank you</u>
<u n="127" who="S0299">oh you've had a letter from him recently?</u>
<u n="128" who="S0262">I have no well he keeps actually writing to my dad I do feel a bit sorry for both of them cos I think they're sort of locked into this thing</u>
<u n="129" who="S0299">okay</u>
<u n="130" who="S0262">where dad has agreed to give erm you know the measurements to to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="131" who="S0299">oh</u>
<u n="132" who="S0262">but I think what started all of this from what I can recall erm before my mum died was I got a sense that after my gran died erm that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had written or phoned my mum and was probably asking her you know whether she she would allow for for us to be measured is the way he put it and I I don't think she was in to the idea at all</u>
<u n="133" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="long"/> yes <pause dur="long"/>no no</u>
<u n="134" who="S0262">at all erm so I think that really that came to a bit of a kind of a a head</u>
<u n="135" who="S0299">I see yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0262">erm but I think I was aware of the fact that some well not fact but some kind of sense of somebody from her past with some connection to her past probably was trying to come back into her present and I could sense that that wasn't making her happy at all</u>
<u n="137" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes <pause dur="short"/> yes yes yes</u>
<u n="138" who="S0262">erm but dad on the other hand has taken a you know I think he's taken more of a kind of a a objective approach which is you know this guy has been collecting this information for years and though he's not entirely sure why erm it's so important for him to have dad's measurements I think more importantly <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is really after <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and myself you know in terms of</u>
<u n="139" who="S0299">you could yes</u>
<u n="140" who="S0262">he's the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> link you know</u>
<u n="141" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="142" who="S0262">we'd have some sort of genes there you know to share</u>
<u n="143" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes yes it is possibly the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> link although he does he's taken all <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> as well</u>
<u n="144" who="S0262">oh has he?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="146" who="S0262">well I suppose in terms of the <trunc>fa</trunc> of the X and Y and the</u>
<u n="147" who="S0299">it's all the</u>
<u n="148" who="S0262">you know the genes yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0299">it's it's all an academic thing at the end of the day</u>
<u n="150" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm mm mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0299">and he does have some papers published but it's all in academia it doesn't sort of help you in any way</u>
<u n="152" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="153" who="S0299">erm but that is</u>
<u n="154" who="S0262" trans="overlap">he seems like a nice old man I mean</u>
<u n="155" who="S0299">he is he's an old man and he's in his eighties I expect and he's just continuing on what he's done all his life really because he also erm <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> so he does his family of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s as well</u>
<u n="156" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="157" who="S0299">but then he does as they as they branch out he'll do you know the the branch of where if <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> married so and so he'll marry</u>
<u n="158" who="S0262" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="159" who="S0299">he does all of those as well so he's he must I don't know what his house must be like because he doesn't use a computer</u>
<u n="160" who="S0262">no he doesn't</u>
<u n="161" who="S0299" trans="overlap">it's all written down</u>
<u n="162" who="S0262">yeah he's written a long list here of measurements you know by hand</u>
<u n="163" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes oh <pause dur="short"/> and yeah and have you done the tests and have you</u>
<u n="164" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well I haven't actually signed up for the tests yet you know because my brother and I haven't really discussed it erm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0299">and your birth weight</u>
<u n="166" who="S0262">the thing about it is is that <pause dur="short"/> I think the first important thing is to try to ascertain whether that was what mum would've wanted or not wanted</u>
<u n="167" who="S0299">I see yes</u>
<u n="168" who="S0262">and I know that she's not here today to say you know one way or the other but <pause dur="short"/> I'm kind of in two minds about it erm I'm sure if this this old gentlemen was in the room I'd probably go yeah yeah you know take my waist measurement but all these other bits and bobs and details I'm not quite sure whether erm you know that that's actually the sort of information that</u>
<u n="169" who="S0299">these are things</u>
<u n="170" who="S0262">I can be bothered to give him</u>
<u n="171" who="S0299">oh droopy eyes that is quite yeah I think from I he's got droopy eyes and so I have I hate my eyes</u>
<u n="172" who="S0262" trans="overlap">oh <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="173" who="S0299">it's that's <trunc>re</trunc> its <trunc>re</trunc> I haven't seen this before he just has sent things to us and we've done I mean we've got to do all these sort of tests like I IQ tests in a way and</u>
<u n="174" who="S0262">mm well I'm scared of doing that I don't want to know my IQ</u>
<u n="175" who="S0299">oh and he well he's done all of ours and my grandson and er but the worst ones are the taste ones and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> says he could be giving us any sort of drugs and we'd probably put it on the end of our tongue and say is it bitter is it this is it that? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="176" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> you see you see if I agree I can see this is gonna be an ongoing thing you know and apparently his daughter is also somehow related to the the project you know this <unclear/> project</u>
<u n="177" who="S0299" trans="overlap">of is she too <unclear/> sense that uhu</u>
<u n="178" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well she wrote another letter because I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> wrote something a little I suppose the way it comes across in the letter <pause dur="short"/> I suppose he's an old gentleman you know</u>
<u n="179" who="S0299">yes he's blunt he does he</u>
<u n="180" who="S0262">he's he's a bit blunt but he also insinuates insinuated something</u>
<u n="181" who="S0299">oh I see</u>
<u n="182" who="S0262">that could've been interpreted in slightly negative fashion about my grandmother</u>
<u n="183" who="S0299">oh I see yes</u>
<u n="184" who="S0262">now that really would've got me going because I had a very strong relationship with my grandmother</u>
<u n="185" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="186" who="S0262">erm and I didn't really like that so I sort of thought what if he really wants something from us wouldn't you be thinking you'd go along with a nice be nice and nice and nice rather than trying to put across something that almost was a little bit distasteful?</u>
<u n="187" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes yes yes</u>
<u n="188" who="S0262">well in fact it was distasteful he he basically said something along the lines of I can't remember the letter but you know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was erm you know not a bright spark which I disagree with erm and you know her head would be turned I suppose by men in parenthesis and it could even have been possibly that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s father I've forgotten his name so my great-grandfather</u>
<u n="189" who="S0299">yeah <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>

<u n="191" who="S0299">yeah</u>
<u n="192" who="S0262">that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> might have been you know had her head turned by <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="193" who="S0299">oh I see yeah</u>
<u n="194" who="S0262">and <trunc>in</trunc>inside of all that was an insinuation was just unfathomable to think about you know what that all meant so</u>
<u n="195" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="196" who="S0262">I could probably see why my mum wasn't a big fan of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="197" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="198" who="S0262">cos that's the sort of thing she would've taken a real</u>
<u n="199" who="S0299">well I I've never met him I know he does lots of these things I'm I but we haven't given him all this information he just sent us things from time to time and we haven't had anything for quite a while but we always knew his handwriting is distinctive so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> say oh it's <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> again</u>
<u n="200" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> oh I know that's what I say when I see the letters drop through the letterbox I say oh god here you go dad and I thankfully he's not so into to write to me you know as addressed to me</u>
<u n="201" who="S0299">yeah</u>
<u n="202" who="S0262">but he is definitely still after us</u>
<u n="203" who="S0299" trans="overlap">well his yes and his wife has died now so he's obviously <trunc>wa</trunc> you know keeping himself occupied</u>
<u n="204" who="S0262">yeah but the daughter wrote and I think she tried to make amends cos she may have erm read what he'd written or maybe he had had had second thoughts about what he'd written</u>
<u n="205" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="206" who="S0262">but he got I had the impression that he realised the error of his ways by writing something like that</u>
<u n="207" who="S0299">yes I see yeah</u>
<u n="208" who="S0262">and that you know certainly I would not take kindly to that</u>
<u n="209" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="210" who="S0262">and I think dad was actually a little bit upset by it too</u>
<u n="211" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="212" who="S0262">erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> on the other hand is you know water off a duck's back you know</u>
<u n="213" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="214" who="S0262">really couldn't be bothered either way</u>

<u n="219" who="S0299">yes he is yes</u>
<u n="220" who="S0262">but I I'm a something else a marine biologist or something but I help him from time to time with his research or his data collection I think she was trying to say this and</u>
<u n="221" who="S0299" trans="overlap">oh I see yes yes cos if he is er we've been in touch with him for years but he's always been slightly eccentric</u>
<u n="222" who="S0262">right so that must be it then <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="223" who="S0299" trans="overlap">and and absolutely blunt</u>
<u n="224" who="S0262" trans="overlap">right crikey</u>
<u n="225" who="S0299">and one might sort of say he's on an <trunc>as</trunc> if he's doing scales he's on an Asperger's scale <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="226" who="S0262">yeah yeah okay <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="227" who="S0299">you know but but I've never met him but through all his letters er he he's quite outspoken and that</u>
<u n="228" who="S0262">but what is the connection of the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> family to the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> family?</u>
<u n="229" who="S0299">oh he'd I think he's a <trunc>sec</trunc> a third cousin to me I'll tell you now right</u>
<u n="230" who="S0262">can I take that from you?</u>
<u n="231" who="S0299">yes and I'll I'll because I my I've not because I've got so much knowledge there I can't <trunc>re</trunc>remember it</u>
<u n="232" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="233" who="S0299">and to say it easily right so our grandfather is called <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and his father was called <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="234" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="235" who="S0299">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> married <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I think this might not be absolutely correct now</u>
<u n="236" who="S0262">oh no don't worry about it it's fact yeah</u>
<u n="237" who="S0299" trans="overlap">so his <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> married <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I think and then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s brother married a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> married <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s sister so from that line</u>
<u n="238" who="S0262">yeah okay</u>
<u n="239" who="S0299">so he's a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> I think she was called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> he's a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> through that line and they came down into the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> so can can you picture it?</u>
<u n="240" who="S0262" trans="overlap">right yeah yeah I see it it's interesting</u>
<u n="241" who="S0299" trans="overlap">I if you go back like that</u>
<u n="242" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="243" who="S0299">a brother a brother and sister married a brother and sister we come from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s line he comes from the sister's line</u>
<u n="244" who="S0262">okay yeah yeah</u>
<u n="245" who="S0299" trans="overlap">so er so I think it makes us like a third cousin or towards me anyway</u>
<u n="246" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="247" who="S0299">erm but <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> is a really good name to research although he is a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and he isn't you know as I am a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/></u>
<u n="248" who="S0262" trans="overlap">right <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="249" who="S0299">erm he does a lot so he will do it with the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s and then the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s also that they married but the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> is a good good name he will contact anybody</u>
<u n="250" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="251" who="S0299">who's a good name he a <pause dur="short"/> a lot of he's given a lot of information</u>
<u n="252" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="253" who="S0299">and I think a lot is right but I'm not sure about everything that he's given not from my research</u>
<u n="254" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="255" who="S0299">because and he seems to be quite obsessed with illegitimacy</u>
<u n="256" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="257" who="S0299">er now the I don't know if you've ever heard of judge <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="258" who="S0262">doesn't ring a bell</u>
<u n="259" who="S0299">oh well no it probably won't but he he sat on the trial for the Great Train Robbery</u>
<u n="260" who="S0262">oh right okay <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="261" who="S0299">well I and it it's just amazing because when I was in grammar school I think I was in first or second year er it was announced in assembly that one of the people from who'd gone to our school had been made a judge and that was him</u>
<u n="262" who="S0262">wow</u>
<u n="263" who="S0299"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said that he's a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> you see well er in my research</u>
<u n="264" who="S0262" trans="overlap">wow <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="265" who="S0299">erm he he his aunt was married to a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/></u>
<u n="266" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="267" who="S0299">his aunt from his</u>
<u n="268" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="269" who="S0299">mother's side</u>
<u n="270" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="271" who="S0299">and she died and the two of them the two boys lived <trunc>wi</trunc>with the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s</u>
<u n="272" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="273" who="S0299">now that's my research says that and definitely his name is <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and I've got them living in that place</u>
<u n="274" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="275" who="S0299">but <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> says that he was the illegitimate son of them but I</u>
<u n="276" who="S0262" trans="overlap">oh yeah yes</u>
<u n="277" who="S0299">so I I favour my research into <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s assumption he was in the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> but he he wasn't but erm</u>
<u n="278" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah oh well I'm beginning to get a bit of a picture now then about <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> because there's you know these kind of ideas that he has you know about how people are born and you know get well you know how they come about and and everything you know in terms of of who does what with who you know</u>
<u n="279" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> that's right yes</u>
<u n="280" who="S0262">erm I just I find yeah I mean he's he is quite an intriguing individual</u>
<u n="281" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="282" who="S0262">but erm but I'm still not sure whether it's not long really since my mother died</u>
<u n="283" who="S0299">no no</u>
<u n="284" who="S0262">and coming back and I you know I was in <anon type="place"/> when my dad told me that mum was dying</u>
<u n="285" who="S0299" trans="overlap">oh you were away yes</u>
<u n="286" who="S0262">erm and so that was in two May two thousand and twelve and she died June seventeenth two thousand and twelve I was due to come back anyway on a on a holiday with my husband</u>
<u n="287" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="288" who="S0262">actually that weekend we flew on the sixteenth of June you know you leave <anon type="place"/> sort of two PM and you you get to <anon type="place"/> at about six in the morning the following day and then we took a coach as we always do to get up from <anon type="place"/> to to <anon type="place"/> erm and you know my mum died about two hours after that so she was definitely holding on to see me and to see <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> erm</u>
<u n="289" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes mm</u>
<u n="290" who="S0262">so I didn't really erm you know I didn't really have much time to spend with her when she was dying so</u>
<u n="291" who="S0299" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="292" who="S0262">but it was so quick you know it was so it was just one of those aggressive cancers and</u>
<u n="293" who="S0299" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> it was cancer of the pancreas?</u>
<u n="294" who="S0262">it was and then it spread into the liver and I think that maybe the lung and you know it it was just</u>
<u n="295" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes how long did she have from the time she knew?</u>
<u n="296" who="S0262">well actually I you know I'm I wasn't there so should probably not say much but you know I know <anon type="place"/> is meant to be a very good hospital but I guess each cancer patient is different erm but what I didn't like about it was that I kept phoning up to say to dad any news any news about the tests?</u>
<u n="297" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="298" who="S0262">you know because we didn't quite know at that stage how far the cancer had spread and he was like well she's on the list for the MRI she's on the list she's on the list she's on the list</u>
<u n="299" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="300" who="S0262">she keeps getting bumped off the more and more and more <trunc>i</trunc>important you know as in more urgent things</u>
<u n="301" who="S0299">yes yeah yeah</u>
<u n="302" who="S0262">so well how about my mum's lost the <trunc>le</trunc> basically she couldn't walk</u>
<u n="303" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="304" who="S0262">you know from the time that I I think I Skyped her early May and I thought god she looks very gaunt</u>
<u n="305" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yeah yeah</u>
<u n="306" who="S0262">her face had actually gone into that kind of look</u>
<u n="307" who="S0299">yeah</u>
<u n="308" who="S0262">where you think to yourself but I thought she had been diagnosed with diabetes too</u>
<u n="309" who="S0299">yeah</u>
<u n="310" who="S0262">and they told her to change her diet radically I mean my mum loved everything that was basically bad for her</u>
<u n="311" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="312" who="S0262">she loved it</u>
<u n="313" who="S0299">mm mm</u>
<u n="314" who="S0262">so she really slimmed down pretty quickly on this new diet you know low salt low sugar and everything</u>
<u n="315" who="S0299" trans="overlap">mm mm yes yeah</u>
<u n="316" who="S0262">and so I thought well maybe it's a bit of that but then I thought in the back of my mind no no no no there's something else there that'll explain this look</u>
<u n="317" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="318" who="S0262">and she actually phoned me on Friday I was yeah Friday evening and she said to me <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I think I've got cancer this was before she lost the really lost her that the use of her legs</u>
<u n="319" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="320" who="S0262">erm she said yeah I think I've got cancer or I've got what granny had now my my granny had a a sort of <trunc>mus</trunc>muscular dystrophy atrophy it was one of those it was one of those ones that you get when you're basically older</u>
<u n="321" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes yes</u>
<u n="322" who="S0262">you know in your seventies which is when granny got it</u>
<u n="323" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="324" who="S0262">erm so I said oh crikey mum <trunc>no</trunc> why do you think that she goes oh I just have a feeling that something's not quite right and I thought okay</u>
<u n="325" who="S0299">mm mm</u>
<u n="326" who="S0262">I hadn't seen her in about a year and a half so I wouldn't know so I asked dad and he said oh I don't know I don't know she's a bit you know confused and  said well you're not gonna be that confused you know if you're not healthy you know</u>
<u n="327" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes yes yes</u>
<u n="328" who="S0262">so I said well let's see you know go to the doctor and it was to me the way it sounded just sounded horrific because she basically used to love a lovely chair like this and she used to sit in her chair</u>
<u n="329" who="S0299">yeah</u>
<u n="330" who="S0262">and she'd watch the television down in the sitting room and she went probably to get up and she realised</u>
<u n="331" who="S0299">yes so she couldn't walk</u>
<u n="332" who="S0262">that there wasn't anything left you know that these <trunc>mus</trunc> my muscles had just started to well just gone I guess so she said to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I can't really walk and he said what do you mean you can't really walk? you know you walked a couple of days ago okay you were a little bit kind of you know but I but anyway apparently it took the whole weekend for a or three or four days for a GP to even come and see her</u>
<u n="333" who="S0299">gosh yes</u>
<u n="334" who="S0262">which time she hadn't been able to I mean they didn't have a way at that time to get her to the bathroom</u>
<u n="335" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes mm</u>
<u n="336" who="S0262">so it all sounded quite from what I can say it sounded like quite a long time had passed before my dad had really clicked that something quite serious was going on with my mum erm and then the GP took blood tests and blood tests and blood tests</u>
<u n="337" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="338" who="S0262">but she still sat in the chair they didn't actually take her by ambulance to the hospital</u>
<u n="339" who="S0299">yes right</u>
<u n="340" who="S0262">so my poor father was trying to take care of my mum</u>
<u n="341" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="342" who="S0262">you know with the basics</u>
<u n="343" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="344" who="S0262">which he wouldn't have known much about how to do</u>
<u n="345" who="S0299">no</u>
<u n="346" who="S0262">he really sort of doesn't have a bedside manner</u>
<u n="347" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="348" who="S0262">he really doesn't have much of one <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="349" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0262">so it was all quite</u>
<u n="351" who="S0299">yes I see</u>
<u n="352" who="S0262">and I and then she got to hospital and she hates doctors and she hates hospitals</u>
<u n="353" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="354" who="S0262">even when I was in hospital she really didn't want to come and see me and er so I knew this would  be very this would've been the worst thing you know for her to happen but</u>
<u n="355" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="356" who="S0262">she was in there fourteen days erm until they realised that she was actually well they said to her look we can give you erm er you know we know it's we know it's spread we know it's aggressive erm we can tell you how much of it really there is in the liver by taking a erm what do they do? you know they go in and they take a kind of</u>
<u n="357" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="358" who="S0262">but my mum said well listen you know you're telling me that I've you're telling that I'm dying so you know erm why do you need to do that then? and they said well only just because and she said well if it's just because no not really I prefer to go home to my dog and my cats and</u>
<u n="359" who="S0299">so did she have she she didn't have chemotherapy?</u>
<u n="360" who="S0262">she chose not well she was too <unclear/> side yeah</u>
<u n="361" who="S0299" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="362" who="S0262">they said they couldn't do anything for her</u>
<u n="363" who="S0299" trans="overlap">so it was quick?</u>
<u n="364" who="S0262">yeah it was so there was so much of it that it was just</u>
<u n="365" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yeah and how long did she live from the time she was diagnosed?</u>
<u n="366" who="S0262">well she was diagnosed on about er I suppose maybe May the fifteenth and yeah she actually died a month later</u>
<u n="367" who="S0299">really?</u>
<u n="368" who="S0262">but the problem was was that the doctors you know what they're like you know some of them are I should say the consultants but some of the are very good cos I've I'm sure you know as well unfortunately you know people have passed away from cancer and you hear all the different ways that the doctors talk about how long people have to live you know and this one had said to my dad erm I would think in erm day no I would think in months I would think in weeks and months not years and <trunc>mon</trunc> or months and years okay I would think in weeks and months that's right now when I saw her when Ifirst got off the plane and we walked straight into the living room and there she was in her hospital bed and I thought well she's got a couple of days</u>
<u n="369" who="S0299">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="370" who="S0262">you know and I'm not a nurse or a doctor</u>
<u n="371" who="S0299">no no</u>
<u n="372" who="S0262">but I you can there's a smell as well you can sort of</u>
<u n="373" who="S0299" trans="overlap">really yes?</u>
<u n="374" who="S0262">it is that you know it's that smell as well and I just thought to myself well she's got a couple of days erm I didn't know it was just a couple of hours so everything was kind of like that it was <trunc>com</trunc> it was compacted into a very short amount of time which some would say it's better to go that way</u>
<u n="375" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="376" who="S0262">than having this</u>
<u n="377" who="S0299" trans="overlap">dragged out yes yes</u>
<u n="378" who="S0262">protracted you know and the palliative you know care was such that at least she got to die in her own home which was fantastic</u>
<u n="379" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="380" who="S0262">you know cos granny died in <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="address"/> and I think granny's mum died there so that would be my grandmother I think even the great-aunt died there too</u>
<u n="381" who="S0299">oh really?</u>
<u n="382" who="S0262">so it's like four women in the family have actually fortuitously in a way</u>
<u n="383" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="384" who="S0262">been able to have that <trunc>re</trunc> that sort of you know dignity</u>

<u n="793" who="S0262">round that part you know the bottom of <anon type="place"/> Street <anon type="place"/> Street so it was it's you know it's right in the heart of it and what was good about it I suppose at the time was erm you know all of these business people erm come in and do these lecturing you know the lectures and they do the the guest lectures and some of them were you know real high-flyers you know we were like oh wow erm because they're alright in the city you know so they were that was great you know that was like a wonderful er exposure to business and then after that I went off to Germany and I decided I wanted to do something different</u>
<u n="794" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes <pause dur="short"/> oh yes</u>
<u n="795" who="S0262">and I was an au pair as a way to get started in Germany</u>

<u n="872" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes so was her mother already here then or they came together?</u>
<u n="873" who="S0262">no no I think it was really granny's decision with a lot of advice and persuasion from her first cousin who married into the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> family erm in <anon type="place"/> so the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s were the people who owned the book stores</u>
<u n="874" who="S0299">okay those yes yes</u>
<u n="875" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah so her first cousin <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had got married and er and you know set up a life in <anon type="place"/> and said you know this is as good a place as any you should come up here because you'll have fun up here and granny I think just took the first chance and said great you know I'm gonna go off and do that and so they bought the house the one that we live in now or dad lives in</u>
<u n="876" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes yes</u>
<u n="877" who="S0262">granny bought it and moved everyone up</u>
<u n="878" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>

<u n="880" who="S0299" trans="overlap">and yeah and her sister</u>
<u n="881" who="S0262">and she moved aunty er well aunty <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> now yeah that would yeah you're right actually that would've been granny's aunt that's right yeah the great-aunt aunty <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> her sister</u>
<u n="882" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="883" who="S0262">and the three well basically granny looked after the two of them</u>
<u n="884" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes yes</u>
<u n="885" who="S0262">and then she had got well of course granny you know said to mum what are you going to do with your teaching qualification? you have to do something</u>
<u n="886" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes yeah</u>
<u n="887" who="S0262">erm and I suppose the idea was that she come here to <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="888" who="S0299" trans="overlap">so did your mother used to go down to <anon type="place"/> when she was in college so did your granny live there at that time or did she live in <anon type="place"/> earlier</u>
<u n="889" who="S0262">I think she had almost two lives gran you know she had a life down in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="890" who="S0299">oh I see</u>
<u n="891" who="S0262">where mum would be</u>
<u n="892" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="893" who="S0262">but quite a lot of the time she was in <anon type="place"/> or she was here</u>
<u n="894" who="S0299">oh I see</u>
<u n="895" who="S0262">or as in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="896" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="897" who="S0262">so throughout mum's teenage years and perhaps even when she was quite you know even before a teenager I get the impression that you know granny had other things to do put it that way</u>
<u n="898" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes I see yes</u>
<u n="899" who="S0262">and I don't know how much mum really did actually get to see of her <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="900" who="S0299">ah ha I see yes</u>
<u n="901" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah because I got the impression that her grandmother brought her up quite a bit</u>
<u n="902" who="S0299" trans="overlap">ah ha I see cos I know she went back to <anon type="place"/> because two of the girls who were in my <trunc>hou</trunc> the house that I lived in erm that's what we called those Nissen huts <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="903" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="904" who="S0299">erm they knew they knew your mother and one of them I can't remember where the other one came but one came from <anon type="place"/> and she she said oh do you know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>? she lives or near where I live</u>
<u n="905" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="906" who="S0299">so I I thought that she so she was going there to her granny then not to her mother really?</u>
<u n="907" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah I think so</u>
<u n="908" who="S0299">yes that was her</u>
<u n="909" who="S0262">think so maybe it was just the proximity as well is that you go for a weekend or</u>
<u n="910" who="S0299" trans="overlap">oh yes yes yes yes</u>
<u n="911" who="S0262">or something I don't but <trunc>fran</trunc></u>
<u n="912" who="S0299">yes it would <trunc>b</trunc> it was still a trek from north Wales to west Wales but</u>
<u n="913" who="S0262" trans="overlap">right that's yeah</u>
<u n="914" who="S0299">not as far as going over to <anon type="place"/> or wherever yes yes</u>
<u n="915" who="S0262">or it could have been that granny had sort of forewarned my mum said look you know I'm pretty much thinking of going here</u>
<u n="916" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="917" who="S0262">can you see if you can get a teaching position pretty quickly after you graduate</u>
<u n="918" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes that's it</u>

<u n="921" who="S0262">close to me</u>
<u n="922" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="923" who="S0262">and I guess they were just lucky to have it all happened so quickly</u>
<u n="924" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="925" who="S0262">I get the impression that that year erm must have been quite a lot of change</u>
<u n="926" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes yes yes I see yeah</u>
<u n="927" who="S0262" trans="overlap">but yeah I you know and then granny really just established herself in <anon type="place"/> and pretty much you know the links with with Wales became</u>
<u n="928" who="S0299">yes really severed yes</u>
<u n="929" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well yeah quite sort of loose really</u>
<u n="930" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="931" who="S0262">and the only person I think that she really really missed a great deal was her great friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who lived in <anon type="place"/> and you know was her great great friend</u>
<u n="932" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="933" who="S0262">erm and we would have make treks down to <anon type="place"/> to see <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> would trek all the way up to <anon type="place"/> to see granny you know on a on a regular basis so so that was when you knew that the <trunc>wa</trunc> the Welsh connection was strong in that friendship but with pretty much everything else it just seemed like</u>
<u n="934" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="935" who="S0262">you know it's it's a world apart</u>

<u n="1962" who="S0299">wherever we go I mean</u>
<u n="1963" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well good for you</u>
<u n="1964" who="S0299">we've lived we've lived here since <trunc>ni</trunc> we've lived in <anon type="place"/> since nineteen sixty-seven which is longer than I lived in Wales</u>
<u n="1965" who="S0262">yes</u>
<u n="1966" who="S0299">but we do feel very much that we are Welsh</u>
<u n="1967" who="S0262" trans="overlap">very Welsh</u>
<u n="1968" who="S0299">and we always say oh we're Welsh</u>
<u n="1969" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yes yes yeah</u>
<u n="1970" who="S0299">erm so it it is a heritage and it's it's lovely and we do come from a really <trunc>lov</trunc> I think they're a nice family the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s and the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s</u>
<u n="1971" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah oh well I'm lucky in that respect then</u>
<u n="1972" who="S0299" trans="overlap">erm my feeling yes yes</u>
<u n="1973" who="S0262">because it's funny because all that I'd heard really from my mum's side granny very rarely talked about <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and if she did it was quite um distant</u>
<u n="1974" who="S0299" trans="overlap">mm yes yes</u>
<u n="1975" who="S0262">but towards the end I asked her about you know her her well I suppose you know her her time with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> erm and <trunc>sh</trunc> and I said I suppose you know she was pretty much erm well she was actually er she was you know she had the disease and I think she sort of thought oh well I may as well just sort of say it like it is and she said oh well <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you know I was young and I married him for his horses you know</u>
<u n="1976" who="S0299" trans="overlap">oh yes yes</u>
<u n="1977" who="S0262">which some would say you know somebody had a nice car in those days</u>
<u n="1978" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes yes</u>
<u n="1979" who="S0262">you know she loved the horses</u>
<u n="1980" who="S0299" trans="overlap">well yes they did</u>
<u n="1981" who="S0262">and</u>
<u n="1982" who="S0299"><anon type="name" nameType="n"/> was a breeder of horses so</u>
<u n="1983" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah she loved these horses</u>
<u n="1984" who="S0299">they yes yes</u>
<u n="1985" who="S0262">she loved them</u>
<u n="1986" who="S0299">yes yeah</u>
<u n="1987" who="S0262">erm and I don't think it was because she married thinking that she'd marry into a wealthy family</u>
<u n="1988" who="S0299" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="1989" who="S0262">cos I think she actually came from quite a well-to-do family herself</u>
<u n="1990" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes yes yes yeah I wouldn't say they were wealthy but they were <trunc>com</trunc> very very comfortable</u>
<u n="1991" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah comfortable farmers</u>
<u n="1992" who="S0299">they were well off and especially as I say after the during the war I think it was even better but</u>
<u n="1993" who="S0262">yeah she these horses just sort of really captured her imagination but <trunc>un</trunc>unfortunately though mum has of the farm days the early days her early childhood really terrible memories</u>
<u n="1994" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="1995" who="S0262">I mean these are just shocking memories now how much over the years she I suppose maybe added to these this childhood memories</u>
<u n="1996" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="1997" who="S0262">but you know whatever her memories were it was unfortunate in a way because I think she carried rather than an anger and a and a hatred for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I think she carried the fact that you know he never really loved her</u>
<u n="1998" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="1999" who="S0262">and that's got to be one of the most hurtful things as a child</u>
<u n="2000" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes yes</u>
<u n="2001" who="S0262">she never felt he loved her</u>
<u n="2002" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="2003" who="S0262">and even though she can sort of rectify the idea or remedy the idea that a man and a woman might fall out of love with each other or not be compatible</u>
<u n="2004" who="S0299" trans="overlap">the man and the woman yes yes yes yes</u>
<u n="2005" who="S0262">she couldn't ever forgive him I think this is what ate her up for the fact that he he he from an early d <trunc>ti</trunc> he really wasn't that interested in her</u>
<u n="2006" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="2007" who="S0262">at all</u>
<u n="2008" who="S0299">yes</u>
<u n="2009" who="S0262">but later he sort of maybe grew into the idea of being a father and really wanting to have perhaps the proper kind of love with with her with his one of his you know his children you know</u>
<u n="2010" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes it it's strange really cos I would say I can talk dispassionately about my father</u>
<u n="2011" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2012" who="S0299">because really my mother's father my grandfather was my father that I the man that I really loved</u>
<u n="2013" who="S0262" trans="overlap">right yes yep</u>
<u n="2014" who="S0299">erm and felt that he was like a father erm so because I didn't really know my father didn't meet him many times really although well I did meet him at different times and he gave me away when I was married</u>
<u n="2015" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2016" who="S0299">erm he was a nice man I think he was I can quite dispassionately say like I could say about the man next door he was a nice man</u>
<u n="2017" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="2018" who="S0299">and he had lots of interests and I think he was very intelligent but I've got a feeling he and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> never had any children</u>
<u n="2019" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="2020" who="S0299">and I don't think he they he he didn't want any other children so I think he was a man who would've been better if he'd been erm never had children at all</u>
<u n="2021" who="S0262" trans="overlap">I see yeah right</u>
<u n="2022" who="S0299">or been a bachelor erm we were when we met him my brother and I erm it would be we'd go to <anon type="place"/> which is between <anon type="place"/> and where we lived and we would meet him for the day</u>
<u n="2023" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="2024" who="S0299">and he could cope with seeing us for the day</u>
<u n="2025" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="2026" who="S0299">and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> would pack a picnic</u>
<u n="2027" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2028" who="S0299">and we'd have a picnic erm it was and then as we were older erm he was more interested and he was more interested in me</u>
<u n="2029" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2030" who="S0299">than my brother because I had gone on to college and we would talk in the way he liked to talk he was seen to be more interested in <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> always says that he says oh he's more he wasn't interested in me but I think because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was a boy and he wasn't one who wanted to chat he'd rather go out and chat up the girls or <trunc>some</trunc> be playing whatever he liked he liked conversation so he would ring and ask to talk to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="2031" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="2032" who="S0299">erm but then she would have been at university or older by then so I think and they you know he did think a lot of her but I think it was because she was a young woman by then</u>
<u n="2033" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2034" who="S0299">erm so I think probably he was a man better off with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who and they never had any children and according to my mother erm she said that he had told <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> he didn't want any children</u>
<u n="2035" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="2036" who="S0299">so whether or not so I don't think it was by accident that they didn't have them because she was young enough</u>
<u n="2037" who="S0262">mm oh twenty yeah</u>
<u n="2038" who="S0299">but she can't be many years older than me</u>
<u n="2039" who="S0262">well that's right</u>
<u n="2040" who="S0299">really</u>
<u n="2041" who="S0262">I mean she was twenty when she married him so I think they</u>
<u n="2042" who="S0299">yes and he was thirty-four fourteen years so</u>
<u n="2043" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2044" who="S0299">so I think erm if that helps you in any way with regard to your mother</u>
<u n="2045" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2046" who="S0299">you can think of him as a nice man</u>
<u n="2047" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2048" who="S0299">but he wasn't paternal</u>
<u n="2049" who="S0262">no no</u>
<u n="2050" who="S0299">really when you were older and he could <trunc>re</trunc>relate to you as somebody who was older that was a different thing</u>
<u n="2051" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2052" who="S0299">he'd probably love you</u>
<u n="2053" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2054" who="S0299">you know with all your <trunc>aca</trunc> and he liked people who were clever and you know all of that sort of thing</u>
<u n="2055" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yes yes it's funny how people mm connect on those points yeah</u>
<u n="2056" who="S0299">but yes yes so erm</u>
<u n="2057" who="S0262">right well that's good I think that's good it is good to know you know these just fill in some of the details or the blanks because you know for many years I just really got the impression that it was more about mum's feeling toward him</u>
<u n="2058" who="S0299">mm</u>
<u n="2059" who="S0262">than myself or <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you know as as grandchildren you know</u>
<u n="2060" who="S0299">yes yes</u>
<u n="2061" who="S0262">erm but now yeah it's more of the point I guess is that you know it's more about the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s you know it's he's a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> I'm a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> you're a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> we all fit in together somehow</u>
<u n="2062" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes that's right yes</u>
<u n="2063" who="S0262">so it's more about that it's a bigger picture really than just one man</u>
<u n="2064" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes that's right yes</u>
<u n="2065" who="S0262">one man's decision what he did and what he didn't do</u>
<u n="2066" who="S0299">so you know I mean I don't really know much about anything because erm it my mother never spoke my mother did love my father</u>
<u n="2067" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2068" who="S0299">all the time until she died even though he was married to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="2069" who="S0262">yeah gosh that must have been heartbreaking for her</u>
<u n="2070" who="S0299" trans="overlap">erm and she did er but she but she never ever said anything bad about him</u>
<u n="2071" who="S0262">no</u>
<u n="2072" who="S0299">erm but she never said anything about why he she began to go out with him when he was married I think that from what I can gather my mother was in the land army</u>
<u n="2073" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="2074" who="S0299">and she worked on a farm and she lived there and I always got the impression that he was living there at the time</u>
<u n="2075" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="2076" who="S0299">so I'm not sure if she knew too much about your grandmother really so</u>
<u n="2077" who="S0262">mm probably not yeah two separate lives that way</u>
<u n="2078" who="S0299" trans="overlap">because you know they they yes and they were in different places and it would've been very just their life would've been there really at <anon type="place"/> I suppose or and then she would come be coming back</u>
<u n="2079" who="S0262">but there was one question I would've asked my grandmother but I think it was little disrespectful so I didn't ever ask erm that from my understanding to get divorced in those days one would have had a pretty good needed a pretty good reason to get divorced</u>
<u n="2080" who="S0299">oh yes yes</u>
<u n="2081" who="S0262">I don't think it's like how it is today just like oh well you know we just sort of don't want there would have to be quite a specific reason</u>
<u n="2082" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="2083" who="S0262">erm and you know most people would say one reason would be adultery that sort of thing</u>
<u n="2084" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes well it would be yes</u>
<u n="2085" who="S0262">and erm so but I never asked it because</u>
<u n="2086" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes well it must have been</u>
<u n="2087" who="S0262">basically you <trunc>ca</trunc> you can't ask that question</u>
<u n="2088" who="S0299" trans="overlap">no really and I mean that's I I don't I don't know if</u>
<u n="2089" who="S0262" trans="overlap">but you you never knew anything about whether that it through all of this I don't suppose the divorce</u>
<u n="2090" who="S0299">I think you can I think</u>
<u n="2091" who="S0262" trans="overlap">things has come though</u>
<u n="2092" who="S0299">ah you you can get records of of divorces but they only start at a certain time and I at the time I was doing this in more detail it wouldn't because they don't release records too early they take you know they every</u>
<u n="2093" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah they let</u>
<u n="2094" who="S0299">the censuses only come out every ten years</u>
<u n="2095" who="S0262" trans="overlap">right yeah</u>
<u n="2096" who="S0299">and it's something like that so I couldn't find a copy of my father's divorce but I'm sure it must have been adultery because I'm not much younger than than your sister your mother</u>
<u n="2097" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah that's right yeah</u>
<u n="2098" who="S0299">so my father was but I'm not sure my mother would have known that he had a child some or perhaps I'm making excuses for her</u>
<u n="2099" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2100" who="S0299">I don't know but it must have been that and it's awful to think that my mother would have been named as the co-respondent</u>
<u n="2101" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well this is it for her reputation</u>
<u n="2102" who="S0299">yes yes but erm well because it seems such a sort of harsh word somehow</u>
<u n="2103" who="S0262">it is really yeah</u>
<u n="2104" who="S0299" trans="overlap">and it seems as though you've done something really deliberate I don't know but erm</u>
<u n="2105" who="S0262">no of course not I wouldn't have seen it like that you know</u>
<u n="2106" who="S0299" trans="overlap">no but she she she never <trunc>re</trunc> she never spoke about that sort of thing really</u>
<u n="2107" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no no I don't I don't think you would yeah</u>
<u n="2108" who="S0299">erm so I don't know the detail of any of that then</u>
<u n="2109" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no but the one last question then is are you in contact with your brother?</u>
<u n="2110" who="S0299">oh my brother? yes</u>

<u n="2119" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah oh that's good</u>
<u n="2120" who="S0299">and and it's really it's so sad really because my mother was afraid she wouldn't say anything and I I had a I <trunc>sa</trunc> I kind of I cos I always loved reading and I I found a letter which said about changing my name and I was ten I think and I always think that's funny that why <trunc>m</trunc> you know I was always called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> but my I'm registered as <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="2121" who="S0262">okay interesting</u>

<u n="2123" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2124" who="S0299">and my mother wouldn't have known any better</u>
<u n="2125" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2126" who="S0299">because now you can put the <trunc>fa</trunc> because my brother is on his birth certificate is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="2127" who="S0262">a yeah yeah</u>

<u n="2129" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>

<u n="2133" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="2134" who="S0299">erm to <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> because my birth certificate had said <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> I can't remember what I was going to say now but so you did oh that's right so <pause dur="short"/> I used to say to my mother then as I got older mum you must tell <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you must tell <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> that you've never been married to our father</u>

<u n="2139" who="S0262" trans="overlap">oh really?</u>

<u n="2141" who="S0262">ah</u>
<u n="2142" who="S0299">and he always thought</u>
<u n="2143" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="2145" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="2150" who="S0299" trans="overlap">you know and he <trunc>mu</trunc> he was in his forties and I thought that is so awful that all the time he thought there was a secret he knew there was something but but that was it we just people weren't open about things in those days</u>

<u n="2152" who="S0299">they my my grandparents took my mother in</u>
<u n="2153" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="2154" who="S0299">erm and we and really having nothing but it was like you don't tell anybody sort of thing and I think everybody in the village where I lived believed that my mother was separated and divorced they didn't know that she was never married</u>
<u n="2155" who="S0262">yeah which I suppose even then separation and divorce would have been considered to be quite a thing to gossip about</u>
<u n="2156" who="S0299" trans="overlap">oh would have yes a thing that's right yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="2157" who="S0262">you know so but then she would have had to have gone quite through a lot of</u>
<u n="2158" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes so er</u>
<u n="2159" who="S0262">heartache</u>
<u n="2160" who="S0299" trans="overlap">that's right</u>
<u n="2161" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="2162" who="S0299">but I think I think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> told my mother to go because when she</u>
<u n="2163" who="S0262" trans="overlap">what to protect her?</u>
<u n="2164" who="S0299">no to get out</u>
<u n="2165" who="S0262">oh really</u>
<u n="2166" who="S0299">I don't know my mother had dementia in her last years and we were visiting her and she just used to talk about she talked a load of rubbish erm but she would say things and she oh god what have I done wrong now what I have done wrong now cos I think cos the way you brought there was religion was really quite it was very much about doing wrong in those days</u>
<u n="2167" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2168" who="S0299">and erm she thought I was born with spina bifida because of what she did</u>
<u n="2169" who="S0262">okay</u>

<u n="2171" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="2172" who="S0299">and then so we were there one day and she said why did she send me away? why did she send me away from the farm? I didn't do anything wrong so from that I think that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> must have said you've got to go back home now that you're having a baby cos I was born in a mother and baby home</u>
<u n="2173" who="S0262">okay yeah</u>

<u n="2179" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah no</u>
<u n="2180" who="S0299">but I do think it's much better to be honest about things you know all these secrets and I can't help you with you know what happened with your mother and my father because I my mother never said you know like my daughter said I can't believe you you believed your mother that there wasn't room in the house <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="2186" who="S0299" trans="overlap">or your grandmother rather yes</u>
<u n="2187" who="S0262">never remarried again so we we never had so it sort of to me it sort of revolved a a lot around <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you know about this relationship with this man you know the the daughter father relationship and the as my mother kept putting it failed marriage you know the way she'd phrase it</u>
<u n="2188" who="S0299" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
