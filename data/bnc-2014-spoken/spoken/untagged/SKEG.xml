<u n="237" who="S0521">this is the thing isn't it? there's no way that you could afford anything like that unless you'd been working for twenty years and you'd been lucky in previous houses because seven hundred thousand is just a huge amount of money</u>
<u n="238" who="S0520" trans="overlap">well that's the other things isn't it? of course it is erm I guess yeah I guess partly it's people who made wise investments with property as well</u>

<u n="244" who="S0520">I think so and people are not like you're no you're you're debt free which the majority of people simply are far from that</u>
<u n="245" who="S0521">it's very old fashioned to be debt free</u>
<u n="246" who="S0520">it is old fashioned but it's very wise</u>
<u n="247" who="S0521">has its advantages <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="248" who="S0520">exactly no of course just not</u>
<u n="249" who="S0521">we survived anyway</u>
<u n="250" who="S0520">yeah of course it's just the not the mentality for most people I think and for the good or for the bad people are paying off their mortgage till the end of their lives you know</u>
