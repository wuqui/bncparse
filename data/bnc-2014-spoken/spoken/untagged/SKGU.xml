<u n="293" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="294" who="S0440">they're about four hundred pounds each but <pause dur="short"/> it means you don't have to have the heating on in the whole of the house cos they're electric driven</u>
<u n="295" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh that's good</u>
<u n="296" who="S0440">and so he can have those on in his room <pause dur="short"/> all the time <pause dur="short"/> but you haven't gotta have the heating on at twenty-two in the rest of the house</u>
<u n="297" who="S0439">yeah but how expensive is that?</u>

<u n="299" who="S0439" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="300" who="S0440">and they keep it at twenty-two <pause dur="short"/> minimum twenty-two <pause dur="short"/> if you need to boost it up then obviously the electric will</u>
<u n="301" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="302" who="S0440">kick in but <pause dur="short"/> he's paying that <pause dur="short"/> in his electric</u>
<u n="303" who="S0439">yeah yeah yeah true</u>
<u n="304" who="S0440">you know his money <pause dur="short"/> but I can't keep the house at the same temperature <unclear>as they're keeping that</unclear></u>
<u n="305" who="S0439" trans="overlap">oh no <pause dur="short"/> not in the summer as well</u>
<u n="306" who="S0440">jesus christ that home last week <pause dur="short"/> cos I said to him <unclear>let's</unclear></u>
<u n="307" who="S0439" trans="overlap">and that makes it smell even more</u>
<u n="308" who="S0440">oh</u>
<u n="309" who="S0440" whoConfidence="low">the heat just</u>
<u n="310" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="311" who="S0440">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> and I just said er</u>
<u n="312" who="S0439" trans="overlap">I just I can imagine it being so nice it would be so <pause dur="short"/> even though it won't be perfect and you and dad'll have <trunc>argument</trunc> blah blah blah</u>

<u n="314" who="S0439" trans="overlap">it'll be so much better</u>
<u n="315" who="S0440">the other thing we'll do is we'll put a very cheap laminate on the floor</u>
<u n="316" who="S0439">yeah like a wooden laminate</u>
<u n="317" who="S0440">a a yeah <pause dur="short"/> an IKEA cheap laminate</u>

<u n="319" who="S0440" trans="overlap"><trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> that's right <pause dur="short"/> that's right <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> but you put something like that down <pause dur="short"/> so that when he's gone <pause dur="short"/> I know it sounds horrible when he's gone <pause dur="short"/> you could actually take it up and put a carpet down or put something else down</u>
<u n="320" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="322" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="323" who="S0440">I just <pause dur="short"/> I I'm trying to think of all the things that we can do <pause dur="short"/> to make that <pause dur="short"/> room</u>
<u n="324" who="S0439" trans="overlap">room his room <unclear/></u>
<u n="325" who="S0440" trans="overlap">but <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>l</trunc> I looked at the ceramic core <pause dur="short"/> radiators and I just thought to myself <pause dur="short"/> that then saves us having to heat <pause dur="short"/> use <pause dur="short"/> every time he wants to kick it up to twenty-two in his <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>that <pause dur="short"/> he's easily got that</unclear></u>
<u n="326" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> he can yeah</u>

<u n="328" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="329" who="S0440" trans="overlap">on <pause dur="short"/> central heating <pause dur="short"/> or it's not controlled on the central heating so I can set my temperature at <pause dur="short"/> what I normally do is eighteen or nineteen</u>
<u n="330" who="S0440" whoConfidence="low">erm</u>
<u n="331" who="S0440">at the weekend we normally set it at eighteen <pause dur="short"/> erm and that means that he can keep his room</u>
<u n="332" who="S0439">mm</u>
<u n="333" who="S0440">much warmer</u>
<u n="334" who="S0439">but it's it's just <pause dur="short"/> he can't carry on where he is and</u>
<u n="335" who="S0440" trans="overlap">oh god</u>
<u n="336" who="S0439">and the thing is <pause dur="short"/> we <trunc>dif</trunc> I like I rang dad a few weeks ago and when he told you that I could work from home on Fridays</u>
<u n="337" who="S0440">mm</u>
<u n="338" who="S0439">I said I rang dad <unclear>said that</unclear> if can work from home on <trunc>F</trunc>Fridays I can work from your house</u>
