<u n="2796" who="S0331">probably <unclear/></u>
<u n="2797" who="S0330" trans="overlap">in terms of like no it's it it'd be cheaper than paying rent that's why everybody wants to buy</u>
<u n="2798" who="S0331">yeah</u>
<u n="2799" who="S0330">it's just that you have to have all these credentials to get a mortgage and it ties you in er for the <trunc>f</trunc>for that time so if you <unclear/></u>

<u n="2862" who="S0330" trans="overlap">fucking hell</u>
<u n="2863" who="S0326">in like wherever and then you</u>
<u n="2864" who="S0331" trans="overlap">christ in <anon type="place"/> yeah</u>
<u n="2865" who="S0326">or like in if you're in uni in like <anon type="place"/> or whatever</u>
<u n="2866" who="S0331">yeah</u>
<u n="2867" who="S0326">you can buy a house in <anon type="place"/> and then you rent it out to other students</u>
<u n="2868" who="S0331">yeah</u>

<u n="2870" who="S0331">yeah</u>
<u n="2871" who="S0326">then once you've been there for three years cos the property's like you've already made twenty grand</u>

<u n="2873" who="S0326">you sell it and then you've got twenty grand <unclear/></u>
<u n="2874" who="S0330">woah</u>
<u n="2875" who="S0331" trans="overlap">yeah no matter what in in <anon type="place"/> especially or anyone like you make money if you predict a property</u>
<u n="2876" who="S0330" trans="overlap">but you don't necessarily that's just our perception right now because we're thinking of it <unclear>very</unclear> short term</u>
<u n="2877" who="S0331" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2878" who="S0330">but the housing market hasn't always been like that it's been up and down</u>
<u n="2879" who="S0331">yeah but it's always gonna be</u>
<u n="2880" who="S0326" trans="overlap">it's up it's up but</u>
<u n="2881" who="S0330" trans="overlap">like we've only seen it go up but it's not always up</u>
<u n="2882" who="S0326">the reason why it's</u>
<u n="2883" who="S0331">it's mainly always up</u>
<u n="2884" who="S0330" trans="overlap">it's not</u>
<u n="2885" who="S0326">it's not really gonna go down I think in especially in <anon type="place"/> because people buy rich people in other countries buy houses in <anon type="place"/> cos it's a better investment than having it in a bank</u>
<u n="2886" who="S0330">yeah but that's only been recently</u>
<u n="2887" who="S0331" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2888" who="S0330">like that's not that's not</u>
<u n="2889" who="S0331" trans="overlap"><unclear>almost always</unclear></u>
<u n="2890" who="S0330">like that it hasn't always been like that in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="2891" who="S0328">no that's true</u>
<u n="2892" who="S0330">you know like er I think</u>
<u n="2893" who="S0328" trans="overlap">but it's a safer bet like at least for the <vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="2894" who="S0331" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2895" who="S0328">short term <unclear>I guess</unclear></u>
<u n="2896" who="S0330">yeah it is a safer bet for the short term</u>
<u n="2897" who="S0328">but also it's not it's not as simple as that it's not like <unclear/> take forty grand er like with my <unclear/> altogether my situation it's not like I can turn that into</u>
<u n="2898" who="S0331" trans="overlap">no you'd have to try hard to get a mortgage and</u>
<u n="2899" who="S0328" trans="overlap">and then er you know <pause dur="short"/> oh man I don't know <unclear/> <unclear>I I really want the money</unclear> <unclear/></u>
<u n="2900" who="S0330">but also I think like things can change <unclear/> means where if <pause dur="short"/> you know if the <pause dur="short"/> you have to pay for upkeep of a building erm of a home or whatever and if suddenly costs go really high for like you know gas electricity and blah blah blah blah blah or rates or whatever like you know paying for er <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="2901" who="S0331" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2902" who="S0328" trans="overlap"><unclear/> basically</u>
<u n="2903" who="S0330">yeah no what I mean is that costs like there are so many variable costs which can change which is why people I think won't necessarily do that</u>
<u n="2904" who="S0331" trans="overlap"><unclear/> the house <unclear/> you're renting it</u>
<u n="2905" who="S0330">yeah I mean that's why people invest in a country where they live so they understand what's going on rather than investing in another country because there are more like unknowable risks you don't you don't always know what's what's happening it's like <unclear/></u>
<u n="2906" who="S0331" trans="overlap"><unclear>oh</unclear> you mean in terms of outside England?</u>
<u n="2907" who="S0330">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2908" who="S0331">oh I see rather than <unclear/></u>
<u n="2909" who="S0330">yeah</u>
<u n="2910" who="S0331"><unclear>I dunno</unclear> I wouldn't worry I think like</u>
<u n="2911" who="S0330">no I'm not saying you should worry I'm just saying these are the reasons why probably people don't do it as often</u>
<u n="2912" who="S0331">really? <unclear/></u>
<u n="2913" who="S0328"><unclear/> I'm gonna do it let's do it this summer</u>
