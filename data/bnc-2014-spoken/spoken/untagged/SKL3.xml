<u n="532" who="S0687">no well I didn't understand on Twenty-Four Hours in A and E was it? or something like that no it wasn't that I can't remember what programme it was erm well I saw it on Gogglebox there was erm <pause dur="short"/> there was erm a boy an eight-year-old boy who needed a new liver and his dad</u>

<u n="536" who="S0687">oh</u>
<u n="537" who="S0688">I mean it is amazing cos you've got your hepatic portal there and you've got all the blood vessels that support it they must have used his existing blood vessels to er</u>

<u n="542" who="S0687">was really really ill so they bumped him up the organ donor list and like six weeks later he he got erm he got a transplant and erm he was doing well but you can imagine his dad went through all that and then he rejects it the little boy <unclear/></u>
<u n="543" who="S0688" trans="overlap">they must have done tissue typing</u>

<u n="548" who="S0689">I wonder could they have not used stem cells to like?</u>
<u n="549" who="S0688">well they're trying to do that now aren't they? they're er using stem cells to grow organs</u>
<u n="550" who="S0687">mm there was erm a stem cell thing that was on erm that the vet was doing the super-vet he it was erm er what's it called? where the ball and socket in your hip doesn't form properly?</u>

<u n="555" who="S0688" trans="overlap">it grew the cup part</u>

<u n="562" who="S0687">that's the one</u>
<u n="563" who="S0689">I can't believe people are against stem cells it's such a</u>
<u n="564" who="S0687">why are people against it?</u>
<u n="565" who="S0689">it's cos they're taken from embryos so they say it's like</u>
<u n="566" who="S0688">sometimes they are but we've got a company in at the hospital collecting erm stem cells from placentas</u>
<u n="567" who="S0689">yeah you can do it from placentas umbilical cords</u>
<u n="568" who="S0687" trans="overlap">oh so like are they gonna ask for if they want to donate?</u>
<u n="569" who="S0688">yeah well they can pay to have their own saved or if they just donate the blood from the placenta er the hospital gets about a tenner for it but the company is is it's <unclear/> it's like two Chinese women</u>
<u n="570" who="S0687">right</u>
<u n="571" who="S0689">doing it it's called</u>
<u n="572" who="S0687">is it proper?</u>
<u n="573" who="S0688"><anon type="place"/> it's called yeah it's kosher the hospital let's them come in they pay the hospital to be there</u>
<u n="574" who="S0687">right</u>
<u n="575" who="S0689">I think it's a really really cool thing to do I mean we learned about it in biology it's really clever how they do it</u>
<u n="576" who="S0687">so women can pay to have their</u>
<u n="577" who="S0688">yeah</u>
<u n="578" who="S0687">stem <trunc>ce</trunc> is it their stem cells or the baby's <trunc>st</trunc>stem cells?</u>
<u n="579" who="S0688">the baby</u>
<u n="580" who="S0687" trans="overlap">stored from the placenta?</u>
<u n="581" who="S0688">yeah</u>
<u n="582" who="S0687">or they can donate it?</u>
<u n="583" who="S0688">or they can just donate it to er then I presume they sell it on</u>
<u n="584" who="S0687">you'd just keep it wouldn't you? in case your child ever needed it</u>
<u n="585" who="S0688">well you would but you don't you don't need that really <unclear/></u>
<u n="586" who="S0687" trans="overlap">you don't need all of it</u>
<u n="587" who="S0688" trans="overlap"><unclear/> also they're doing that</u>
<u n="588" who="S0687" trans="overlap">to be honest I don't know I don't know what I think about donating it so someone else can sell it for a profit</u>
<u n="589" who="S0688">yeah I know</u>
<u n="590" who="S0687" trans="overlap">donate it so that someone <trunc>cou</trunc></u>
<u n="591" who="S0688" trans="overlap">can make money from it</u>
<u n="592" who="S0687" trans="overlap">yeah well well I was gonna say to help you know like if somebody needed a new liver or whatever not donate for someone else to make a fortune</u>
<u n="593" who="S0688" trans="overlap">I I questioned them about it and they</u>
<u n="594" who="S0690" trans="overlap">it's not gonna happen unless someone makes a profit</u>
<u n="595" who="S0688">they're dead shady about it</u>
<u n="596" who="S0687">I was gonna say it sounds a bit questionable</u>
<u n="597" who="S0690">yeah but</u>
<u n="598" who="S0687" trans="overlap">do the women know that they're donating it to be sold?</u>
<u n="599" who="S0688">well they don't give them all the information but I've asked and asked and asked them <pause dur="short"/> but you see the thing is</u>
<u n="600" who="S0687" trans="overlap">how many women do it?</u>
<u n="601" who="S0688">they're not well organised enough cos they the the they work from seven in the morning till eight at night at the moment but they're</u>
<u n="602" who="S0687" trans="overlap">these two women?</u>
<u n="603" who="S0688">yeah er but they're gonna be twenty-four hours soon</u>
<u n="604" who="S0687">right</u>
<u n="605" who="S0688">erm cos they have to collect</u>
<u n="606" who="S0687" trans="overlap">so they can collect them quickly?</u>
<u n="607" who="S0688">yeah they have to collect it within</u>
<u n="608" who="S0689">is it just those two women running it?</u>
<u n="609" who="S0688">they're working for <anon type="place"/> company</u>
<u n="610" who="S0689">well they must</u>
<u n="611" who="S0688" trans="overlap">but there were other companies that used to come in before I've collected it before now</u>
<u n="612" who="S0687">mm</u>
<u n="613" who="S0688">when it first started</u>
<u n="614" who="S0687">how long ago?</u>
<u n="615" who="S0688" trans="overlap">about ten years ago</u>
<u n="616" who="S0687">right</u>
<u n="617" who="S0688">er no probably be more like about twelve years ago cos I was working in <trunc>hospi</trunc> er women would come with the pack</u>
<u n="618" who="S0687">mm</u>
<u n="619" who="S0688">and we'd take it from the placenta and they and then ring the company and they'd come and send a van and collect it take it off for processing</u>
<u n="620" who="S0687" trans="overlap">how much do people pay for it?</u>
<u n="621" who="S0688">and then they spent two thousand pound</u>
<u n="622" who="S0689">wow</u>
<u n="623" who="S0688">it's worth it though <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> if you had it when you think people spend that on a pram</u>
<u n="624" who="S0689">so people spend two grand on a pram?</u>
<u n="625" who="S0688" trans="overlap">yeah it's ridiculous yeah I'd rather have a second hand pram and do that and save your baby's stem cells</u>
<u n="626" who="S0689">I dunno why you'd save the baby's stem cells though</u>
<u n="627" who="S0688">well if they if they had a problem</u>
<u n="628" who="S0687" trans="overlap">because if if if in the</u>
<u n="629" who="S0689" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="630" who="S0688">an illness</u>
<u n="631" who="S0687" trans="overlap">in the future</u>
<u n="632" who="S0688">I suppose in they first used it for leukaemia so if a child developed leukaemia they could use the stem cells to just inject the bone marrow <pause dur="short"/> and they can cultivate it so it's not like they use them up they carry on reproducing in the right conditions</u>
<u n="633" who="S0689">yeah but those conditions are extremely hard to find</u>
<u n="634" who="S0688">no in the laboratory</u>
<u n="635" who="S0689">trust me mum we've done about it in biology they're trying to find the way different the different like so they tested different conditions and what those different conditions do to the way that the cells</u>
<u n="636" who="S0687">reproduce</u>
<u n="637" who="S0689" trans="overlap">no it's called right basically a stem cell is an undifferentiated cell</u>
<u n="638" who="S0687">yeah</u>
<u n="639" who="S0689">so before when a cell is formed it's not a a a liver cell or a</u>
<u n="640" who="S0687">yeah exactly it's just cell</u>
<u n="641" who="S0688" trans="overlap">heart cell and a <trunc>differ</trunc> if it differentiates to become a certain cell</u>
<u n="642" who="S0687">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="643" who="S0689">so an undifferentiated cell means that it's not picked what it is cell it is yet basically</u>
<u n="644" who="S0687">yeah</u>
<u n="645" who="S0689">so I'm saying scientists are trying to find the conditions needed to turn the cells in a <trunc>lab</trunc> er like when cultivating them to the cells that they want</u>
<u n="646" who="S0688">oh I know but I what I'm saying is in the raw form as an</u>
<u n="647" who="S0687" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="648" who="S0688" trans="overlap">undifferentiated cell</u>
<u n="649" who="S0687">it can just</u>
<u n="650" who="S0688" trans="overlap">they can just inject that they can just reproduce</u>
<u n="651" who="S0689">oh yeah sorry I didn't right yeah I understand</u>
<u n="652" who="S0688" trans="overlap">so that's what I'm saying</u>
<u n="653" who="S0689" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="654" who="S0687" trans="overlap">I didn't think</u>
<u n="655" who="S0688" trans="overlap"><unclear/> run out</u>
<u n="656" who="S0687">yeah I I it's not I didn't think it was like they've got a stem cell and then they grow a liver in a test tube they inject those to wherever it is in that and you within your body it it works I thought is that right?</u>
<u n="657" who="S0688">no but they're trying to grow organs now from stem cells</u>
<u n="658" who="S0687">right</u>
<u n="659" who="S0688">so they're trying to</u>
<u n="660" who="S0687" trans="overlap">so like in vitro stems?</u>
<u n="661" who="S0689">they've worked on mice and rats I know that</u>
<u n="662" who="S0688" trans="overlap">they yeah they've been putting them into a pig haven't they? they've just injected they took a they grew a heart in a pig</u>
<u n="663" who="S0687">right</u>
<u n="664" who="S0689">they've been growing insulin in pigs for years haven't they?</u>
<u n="665" who="S0687">and then what do they take it out of the pig then and put it in a human?</u>
<u n="666" who="S0688">mm</u>
<u n="667" who="S0687">so it is a bit questionable</u>
<u n="668" who="S0689">yeah but</u>

<u n="670" who="S0689" trans="overlap">a pig for a human you know</u>
<u n="671" who="S0687">yeah absolutely if you know if it was <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and it was a pig or <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> absolutely</u>
<u n="672" who="S0690">bacon sandwich? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="676" who="S0688">mm not bad</u>
<u n="677" who="S0687">yeah</u>
<u n="678" who="S0688">the thing is they've not got themselves well organised enough they come let so they'll come up to the birth suite and say is anyone in labour? what woman wants to talk about that</u>
<u n="679" who="S0687">yeah</u>
<u n="680" who="S0688" trans="overlap">when she's giving birth?</u>
<u n="681" who="S0687">I was gonna say</u>

<u n="683" who="S0687" trans="overlap">surely it should be something that they discuss with people beforehand and get them to agree to it beforehand</u>
<u n="684" who="S0688">yeah</u>
<u n="685" who="S0687">but you know like anyone who not being nasty but anyone who would understand why they would want their stem cells would surely want to save them for themselves</u>

<u n="687" who="S0687" trans="overlap">for their child?</u>
