<u n="7" who="S0615" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="8" who="S0525">don't give him a meal <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="9" who="S0615">well obviously not</u>
<u n="10" who="S0525">but yes he can still have some milk but <pause dur="short"/> why don't you try water and see how that's when I used to give you</u>
<u n="11" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0525">erm those herbal juices instead</u>
<u n="13" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0525">which was that like do they still do that? it was like a powder that went in the water</u>
<u n="15" who="S0615" trans="overlap">I think so yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0525">so it's really water so it's just the case of erm <pause dur="short"/> if they're not really hungry they'll go back to sleep on it</u>
<u n="17" who="S0615">mm yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> okey-doke <pause dur="short"/> we'll see <pause dur="short"/> yes I've got freezing in the ice cube trays there</u>
<u n="18" who="S0525">oh have they? well that's the easiest way to do it because erm <pause dur="short"/> you know once you've made an apple he's only gonna have a tiny bit of it</u>
<u n="19" who="S0615">mm hm yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> one to two teaspoons</u>
<u n="20" who="S0525">do they tell you what to do with it there? <pause dur="short"/> cos I I didn't add anything I just</u>
<u n="21" who="S0615" trans="overlap">one to two</u>
<u n="22" who="S0525">I'd just add maybe a drop of water</u>
<u n="23" who="S0615">yeah</u>

<u n="29" who="S0615" trans="overlap">first the baby should have purees of fruits like apples and pears</u>
<u n="30" who="S0525">do they puree it as well or do they just do they actually put it in the machine to <trunc>pu</trunc> to blend it or do they just leave it?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0615" trans="overlap">erm <pause dur="short"/> I don't know after the first few weeks your baby can graduate to either raw mashed or pureed fruits <pause dur="short"/> da da da da da nope <pause dur="short"/> make the rice or puree fairly wet and soft <pause dur="short"/> at first</u>
<u n="32" who="S0525">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0615">yes <unclear/> mix the puree in a plastic removable top on a feeding bottle <pause dur="short"/> which has been sterilised <pause dur="short"/> hold your baby comfortably on your lap or sit her in a baby chair <pause dur="short"/> it would be better if both of you were protected against spills <vocal desc="laugh"/> choose a time when your baby's not frantically hungry maybe give her some milk first to particularly satisfy her she will then be more receptive to the new idea <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> special weaning spoons can be bought</u>
<u n="34" who="S0525">crikey what's wrong with little plastic spoons we used to have?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> start by giving just one solid feed during the day <pause dur="short"/> at lunchtime <pause dur="short"/> yes apple <pause dur="short"/> choose a sweet variety of eating apple <pause dur="short"/> put into a heavy saucepan with four to five tablespoons of water so yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0525">mm hm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0615">heat and then or steam for the same amount of time <pause dur="short"/> puree</u>

<u n="39" who="S0615">if steaming add some of the boiled water from the bottom of the steamer to thin out the puree <pause dur="short"/> also apple and cinnamon as well <pause dur="short"/> I'll have some of that <pause dur="short"/> a bit for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> a bit for me</u>

<u n="54" who="S0525">no no I mean you're you're getting to the <trunc>s</trunc> the point the stage now where <pause dur="short"/> you haven't got to sterilise</u>

<u n="647" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="648" who="S0615">so it's <pause dur="short"/> takes quicker to <pause dur="short"/> so it takes less time to heal and</u>
<u n="649" who="S0525">yeah</u>
<u n="650" who="S0615">those sorts</u>
<u n="651" who="S0525">somebody else turned up half an hour late because of the traffic <pause dur="short"/> I didn't have to do my signing with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who only got four out of fifteen <pause dur="short"/> so me and <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> had got ten each</u>
<u n="652" who="S0615">oh dear</u>
<u n="653" who="S0525">we were much better <pause dur="short"/> so we're doing fingerspelling and then she was teaching us the time <pause dur="short"/> she didn't then she said because like I said she sits in two rows and one of us have our back to her</u>
<u n="654" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>

<u n="656" who="S0615" trans="overlap">okay <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="657" who="S0525">so she was trying to teach us <pause dur="short"/> she goes there's so many different ways of doing time <pause dur="short"/> so she said nobody likes any of them</u>
<u n="658" who="S0615">no</u>
<u n="659" who="S0525">so we were doing <pause dur="short"/> for one o'clock we bring it <pause dur="short"/> we were bringing it from the cheek cos we were told that age is from your nose</u>
<u n="660" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="661" who="S0525">money's from your chin</u>
<u n="662" who="S0615">mm</u>
<u n="663" who="S0525">time is from your cheek so we would go one o'clock like that</u>
<u n="664" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="665" who="S0525">two o'clock three o'clock she oh there's a rainbow out there she just does erm</u>
<u n="666" who="S0615">oh</u>
<u n="667" who="S0525"><vocal desc="misc"/> she just does one one o'clock <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> to does it like that <pause dur="short"/> which is fine</u>
<u n="668" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="669" who="S0525">and then we <pause dur="short"/> we did half past the same so that was</u>
<u n="670" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="671" who="S0525">half past one <pause dur="short"/> erm and that was all we did and then she she does that for quarter past</u>
<u n="672" who="S0615">okay</u>
<u n="673" who="S0525">and that's for quarter to</u>
<u n="674" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="675" who="S0525">so you're just pointing to where the she goes imagine that's an arrow and you're just pointing to where</u>
<u n="676" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="677" who="S0525">she does it all signing so</u>
<u n="678" who="S0615" trans="overlap">but it's you it's</u>
<u n="679" who="S0525">I understood</u>
<u n="680" who="S0615">to you not to the person?</u>
<u n="681" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah yeah she says so imagine you've got the clock in front of you</u>
<u n="682" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="683" who="S0525">and you're so your quarter past three and then quarter past five quarter past nine yeah?</u>
<u n="684" who="S0615">mm</u>
<u n="685" who="S0525">or quarter to twelve</u>
<u n="686" who="S0615">mm hm</u>
<u n="687" who="S0525">so she says you know do it <pause dur="short"/> and then it's no it's just she moved the hand away completely so it was just that one</u>
<u n="688" who="S0615" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="689" who="S0525">so I think erm <pause dur="short"/> and then she's doing <pause dur="short"/> and then we did ten past so you've got the sign for ten which is that</u>
<u n="690" who="S0615">okay</u>
<u n="691" who="S0525">ten past two</u>
<u n="692" who="S0615">okay</u>
<u n="693" who="S0525">ten past five</u>
<u n="694" who="S0615">okay</u>
<u n="695" who="S0525">so so you you're doing your ten and then you're moving your hand in a past motion so that made sense</u>
<u n="696" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> mm hm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="697" who="S0525">you know ten and she goes hold it kind of where your ten would be</u>
<u n="698" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="699" who="S0525">so ten past ten to was harder ten to one ten to two</u>
<u n="700" who="S0615">okay</u>
<u n="701" who="S0525">so you <pause dur="short"/> but ten to</u>
<u n="702" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="703" who="S0525">nine was a bit it's harder to get the movement with your hand or</u>
<u n="704" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="705" who="S0525">ten to twelve</u>
<u n="706" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="707" who="S0525">but I could see where she was going with that and loads of people couldn't get it so you're either moving like that or you're doing that</u>
<u n="708" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="709" who="S0525">which makes sense then we were doing twenty which is twenty past two <trunc>twe</trunc> er twenty so she's doing two</u>
<u n="710" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="711" who="S0525">and making a nought that way <pause dur="short"/> to past but then the twenty to was twenty to one</u>
<u n="712" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <unclear/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="713" who="S0525">twenty to two</u>
<u n="714" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="715" who="S0525">twenty to <pause dur="short"/> nine</u>
<u n="716" who="S0615">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="717" who="S0525">she goes you've just got to practise this now with this with this hand movement we didn't do twenty-five so I wonder what that would be?</u>
<u n="718" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> well what's twenty-five?</u>
<u n="719" who="S0525" trans="overlap">for <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> a two and then a five</u>
<u n="720" who="S0615">okay</u>
<u n="721" who="S0525">but then <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> a five would probably be easy cos you'd go five past or you'd got five to I'm assuming we didn't get that far</u>
<u n="722" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah mm <pause dur="short"/> you'd just go half past then <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="723" who="S0525">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> well you'd you'd say cos it'd be you'd go like well five <pause dur="short"/> twenty-five wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="724" who="S0615">mm yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="725" who="S0525" trans="overlap">you'd do it like that</u>
<u n="726" who="S0615"><unclear/></u>
<u n="727" who="S0525">but she was she's told us so many different ways to what <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> told us</u>
<u n="728" who="S0615">mm</u>
<u n="729" who="S0525">she doesn't she does that for week <pause dur="short"/> whereas we were making the W sign and she said no cos they class that as fingerspelling and anything you do that's fingerspelling marks you down like TV we'd have made</u>
<u n="730" who="S0615" trans="overlap">okay <pause dur="short"/> oh okay</u>
<u n="731" who="S0525">T and V</u>
<u n="732" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="733" who="S0525">she's no use that or use that aerial sign she goes <pause dur="short"/> it's a sign</u>
<u n="734" who="S0615" trans="overlap">oh wow okay</u>
<u n="735" who="S0525">she goes BSL is more about structures cos she's just put some people go I think was that a quarter? <pause dur="short"/> where they go like quarter past <trunc>quart</trunc> and they do that?</u>
<u n="736" who="S0615" trans="overlap">okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="737" who="S0525">she goes that's English cos you're doing quarter and you're doing past</u>
<u n="738" who="S0615">mm</u>
<u n="739" who="S0525">whereas BSL is quarter past is one word or one movement</u>
<u n="740" who="S0615">yeah yeah yeah which you think it should be for</u>
<u n="741" who="S0525">yeah so she says but a lot of people will go <trunc>quar</trunc> you know past quarter past like that</u>
<u n="742" who="S0615">cos otherwise you may as well be spelling it all out with the alphabet</u>
<u n="743" who="S0525">well this is yeah so it made sense what she's saying</u>
<u n="744" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="745" who="S0525">and then the other thing she's gonna do next week now we're gonna be timed to do this</u>
<u n="746" who="S0615">okay</u>
<u n="747" who="S0525">on the alphabet cos she's fingerspelling every week to us</u>
<u n="748" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="749" who="S0525">still she said your fingerspelling's really poor which it is <pause dur="short"/> so now we've got to go through the alphabet in and under ten seconds and I've not tried it yet</u>
<u n="750" who="S0615">oh wow</u>
<u n="751" who="S0525">so <pause dur="short"/> p <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> o P Q R <pause dur="short"/> s T U <pause dur="short"/> v V <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="752" who="S0615" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="nonsense"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="753" who="S0525">B X Y <pause dur="short"/> I'm probably not far off</u>
<u n="754" who="S0615">probably about fifteen seconds</u>
<u n="755" who="S0525">do you reckon? we'll have to time it but</u>
<u n="756" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="757" who="S0525">I think if you get you'd have to get <pause dur="short"/> she goes your practice is at home because you know I'm gonna time you</u>
<u n="758" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="759" who="S0525">so I think if you get it you know <pause dur="short"/> a B C <pause dur="short"/> d E F <pause dur="short"/> h I J <pause dur="short"/> k L M <pause dur="short"/> n O P Q <pause dur="short"/> what was that Q?</u>

<u n="761" who="S0525">R S <pause dur="short"/> T U V <pause dur="short"/> w X Y <pause dur="short"/> I think if I broke it down</u>
<u n="762" who="S0615">yeah into like threes and get the hang of it follow us upstairs <unclear/> doing his nappy</u>
<u n="763" who="S0525" trans="overlap">because <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos she just does yeah <pause dur="short"/> she just does that for S she doesn't link in</u>
<u n="764" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah I know you've said that last week</u>
<u n="765" who="S0525" trans="overlap">cos yeah <pause dur="short"/> and she just does that a lot for E and people are going for X cos <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> has spelt to me she she spelt out week she went W but she did X X looked at me and then <unclear/> but I knew <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was signing an E cos I'd been there</u>
<u n="766" who="S0615" trans="overlap">oh <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> oh okay</u>
<u n="767" who="S0525"><anon type="name" nameType="n"/> hadn't been there the week before so</u>
<u n="768" who="S0615" trans="overlap">right okay</u>
<u n="769" who="S0525">she was amazed I'd got I'd got what she signed but she didn't know</u>
<u n="770" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="771" who="S0525">what she was signing to me how weird is that?</u>
<u n="772" who="S0615" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="773" who="S0525"><vocal desc="laugh"/> so I got that</u>
<u n="774" who="S0615">that's a bit odd isn't it <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="775" who="S0525">yeah that was cos I could see the look on her face but she <trunc>do</trunc> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> does it depending on how she's holding her hands so if her hand's</u>
<u n="776" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="777" who="S0525">palm up instead of palm down she'll just put</u>
<u n="778" who="S0615">yeah that's what you said yeah</u>
<u n="779" who="S0525">cos she's just doing it <pause dur="short"/> it makes sense she's just doing it quicker</u>
<u n="780" who="S0615">well especially for a word like week that <trunc>ob</trunc> well if you've got W and K you're obviously not gonna have <unclear/></u>
<u n="781" who="S0525" trans="overlap">well she was that's cos she was there yeah we yeah</u>
<u n="782" who="S0615" trans="overlap">I'm gonna have to put him down</u>
<u n="783" who="S0525">rather than putting her hands moving her hand right around it's just W and the E E K was all <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="784" who="S0615">yeah <pause dur="short"/> see how your little <pause dur="short"/> jabs are doing <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="785" who="S0525" trans="overlap">but I missed she's I missed Tuesday and got it I spelt today <pause dur="short"/> I spelt</u>
<u n="786" who="S0615">oh</u>
<u n="787" who="S0525">erm I didn't I didn't see her doing she was too</u>
<u n="788" who="S0615" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="789" who="S0525"><unclear/> T U E S she must have got a bit I don't know she was kinda linking it</u>
<u n="790" who="S0615" trans="overlap">and you just went T O?</u>
<u n="791" who="S0525">yeah I went in the <unclear>O</unclear> wasn't sure what she'd done and I spelt today <pause dur="short"/> but I didn't think I'd got it right</u>
<u n="792" who="S0615">ah</u>
<u n="793" who="S0525">and that's the sign for no <pause dur="short"/> she spelt no out as well <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> that was quite simple <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="794" who="S0615" trans="overlap">okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="795" who="S0525"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I got so <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> has spelt no to me</u>
<u n="796" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="797" who="S0525">and then erm <pause dur="short"/> then what what she does then is she is she still stands behind us</u>
<u n="798" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="799" who="S0525">but she does the sign so when she spells out a name</u>
<u n="800" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="801" who="S0525">she then does the sign at the end so the they sign to me</u>
<u n="802" who="S0615">okay</u>
<u n="803" who="S0525">so you know if you've got your word right</u>
<u n="804" who="S0615">oh yeah</u>
<u n="805" who="S0525">cos when she does the fingerspelling as well when <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> signs to me she's not allowed to mouth it <pause dur="short"/> it's got to be it's got to go</u>
<u n="806" who="S0615" trans="overlap"><unclear/> it's got to be</u>
<u n="807" who="S0525">so obviously she's done N A M E and I've</u>
<u n="808" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="809" who="S0525">written it down so then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> does the sign</u>
<u n="810" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="811" who="S0525">that <pause dur="short"/> and we can mime it so you can say like that so <pause dur="short"/> er so that's how we knew we were doing it but obviously then she was doing <pause dur="short"/> no now I knew I'd got no right we all knew <unclear/> it's only N O</u>
<u n="812" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="813" who="S0525">so we all knew we'd spelt it right <vocal desc="laugh"/> and when she's doing the sign everybody in that side is like looking what? what?</u>
<u n="814" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> what's that? yeah</u>
<u n="815" who="S0525">and she's doing this she's doing this sign</u>
<u n="816" who="S0615">okay mm</u>
<u n="817" who="S0525">no <pause dur="short"/> and so she comes around to all of us then and stands at the head of the line</u>
<u n="818" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="819" who="S0525">what have you been learning?</u>
<u n="820" who="S0615" trans="overlap">ah <pause dur="short"/> oh no</u>
<u n="821" who="S0525"><unclear/> sign and she says she says you tell me what's the sign for no? so we all shake our head</u>
<u n="822" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="823" who="S0525">and she's yes that that is correct but in a lot of the context if you really wanna it's like if you said to me can I go home?</u>
<u n="824" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="825" who="S0525">no</u>
<u n="826" who="S0615">oh</u>
<u n="827" who="S0525">it's not you know not no or not <trunc>sh</trunc> no it would be that she's like this is what I would use with my children all the time no</u>

<u n="830" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="831" who="S0525"><vocal desc="laugh"/> she says erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah so she was and then she saw what we'd done on time and she goes well why have you only learnt as far as half past? and that was that so</u>
<u n="832" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="833" who="S0525"><unclear/> she said I'm gonna ask <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> how she would do all this</u>
<u n="834" who="S0615">okay</u>
<u n="835" who="S0525">so we've got a bit of work to do <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> on the old signing haven't we?</u>
<u n="836" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="837" who="S0525">we've got a bit of work to do</u>

<u n="840" who="S0615">oh that's good</u>
<u n="841" who="S0525">she signs</u>
<u n="842" who="S0615" trans="overlap">go through the alphabet obviously she needs <pause dur="short"/> she's realised that <pause dur="short"/> rather than just moving on so maybe it's not that bad if your exams <unclear/></u>
<u n="843" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yes it's it's because she's not going over new stuff she's just I mean we learnt structuring and she said and we learnt let you know let me know</u>
<u n="844" who="S0615">mm hm</u>
<u n="845" who="S0525">that was a <pause dur="short"/> so she's not signing all the words out she's giving us phrases</u>
<u n="846" who="S0615">which is yeah that's</u>
<u n="847" who="S0525">cos that's that <vocal desc="laugh"/> I was getting cos that's Wolverhampton don't forget</u>
