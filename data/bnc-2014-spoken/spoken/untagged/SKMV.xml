<u n="48" who="S0262">I loved it</u>
<u n="49" who="S0298">I thought it was quite fun though</u>
<u n="50" who="S0261">it was fun but it was actually well done</u>
<u n="51" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="56" who="S0298">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0262">I liked it but no I found I mean I found that yeah she wasn't I didn't think for one moment she was actually going to become a nun</u>
<u n="58" who="S0298">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0262">so that was the thing is that I thought oh she's just going to have to <unclear/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0298" trans="overlap">she's far too pretty to become a nun</u>
<u n="61" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's unbelievable really she had a child she could have just become her aunt</u>
<u n="62" who="S0298">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0262">she could have just moved into the aunt's place</u>
<u n="64" who="S0298">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0262">and become some sort of you know</u>
<u n="66" who="S0261" trans="overlap">of course she could have just lived her life</u>

<u n="69" who="S0261">she just wanted to come out for a peek before she kind of signed up</u>
<u n="70" who="S0262">well I think it was I think if that is if that's true that's a good idea that if you're if you're brought up in a in you know</u>
<u n="71" who="S0261" trans="overlap">it's a test</u>
<u n="72" who="S0262">that they actually</u>
<u n="73" who="S0298">oh and she <trunc>we</trunc> <trunc>go</trunc> I mean from what I understood she she was brought up in a convent</u>

<u n="75" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0261">yeah yeah yeah that's right mm</u>

<u n="78" who="S0298">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0262">you need to go and test yourself before you really take your vows I think that's a great idea</u>
<u n="80" who="S0298">yeah of course</u>
<u n="81" who="S0262">I didn't really know that they did that <pause dur="short"/> but it was a good film it's actually nice to see something which is professionally shot</u>
<u n="82" who="S0298" trans="overlap">I mean I really I really liked the photography in that</u>
<u n="83" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0298">because it was just it was really nice</u>
<u n="86" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0298">and they taped over the slightly <trunc>slo</trunc> er slower bits I mean the film wasn't particularly fast either but it was a because it was just like so nicely shot and so calm and reasonable</u>
<u n="88" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was it was quite meditative yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0298">yeah you were just like sit there and you know chill</u>
<u n="90" who="S0262">yeah they're quite nice stills actually when we came out there was like three really nice stills from the film</u>

<u n="95" who="S0298">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0261">I thought that was that was just it was</u>
<u n="97" who="S0298">I thought it was even better if er once they drove back to <unclear/> er if she ended up in a in a ditch again with the same policeman</u>
<u n="98" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah if she'd learnt to drive somehow yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="100" who="S0262">yeah that would be funny <pause dur="short"/> getting the horses to pull the car out of the ditch it's just unbelievable</u>
<u n="101" who="S0298">no I mean this was like what like nineteen seventies nineteen eighties er Poland</u>
<u n="102" who="S0262">ah even when I was there when I was driving on their well their main roads not the motorways well kind of like a motorway it's a main road</u>
<u n="103" who="S0298" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0262">and erm you know there'd there'd be one lane and there would be four different sets of traffic in your lane</u>
<u n="105" who="S0298" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0262">and you'd be overtaking some slow car and the slow car was <trunc>ta</trunc> overtaking somebody on a bike and the person on a bike was overtaking a horse and cart</u>
<u n="107" who="S0298">yeah mm</u>
<u n="108" who="S0262">and then you'd have BMWs and Mercedes</u>
<u n="109" who="S0298">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0262">overtaking my car which would I had a hire car I can't remember what it was</u>
<u n="111" who="S0298">yeah</u>

<u n="113" who="S0298">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0262">and then you'd find that the erm the ruts</u>
<u n="115" who="S0298">mm mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0262">in the roads were so bad</u>
<u n="117" who="S0298">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0262">that it's uncomfortable driving unless you know you're driving off the ruts but driving in the ruts is it's just</u>
<u n="119" who="S0298">yeah yeah my parents were there in eighty-five I think cos my father is from erm <anon type="place"/> and he</u>
<u n="120" who="S0262" trans="overlap">your dad?</u>
<u n="121" who="S0298">yeah well he he can't remember it he was like three years old when when when they fled but er cos they the Russians were coming</u>

<u n="123" who="S0298">but some of the his relatives stayed there erm er but they didn't get much er contact with them only sort of occasionally sort of letter and they were still speaking German there but they're and they several of them came to my grandparents' golden wedding anniversary er but not as a couple although the children had to stay behind to make sure that they go back</u>
<u n="124" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="125" who="S0298">I I'm not kidding you</u>

<u n="127" who="S0298">yeah so</u>
<u n="128" who="S0262">but its it's yeah it's funny that that's the way it's done so</u>
<u n="129" who="S0298" trans="overlap">so and then my parents and my uncle went there a couple of times</u>
<u n="130" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0298">er and <trunc>t</trunc> that must have been sort of eighty-five eight-six or something like that</u>
<u n="132" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah wow</u>
<u n="133" who="S0298">and er I'm not sure they still have photos from there was I remember seeing the photos and it was very much like like the film</u>
<u n="134" who="S0262" trans="overlap">like that yeah yeah yeah some of the hotels I went to</u>
<u n="135" who="S0298">and when I went in eighty-nine it was still very much like that</u>
<u n="136" who="S0262">yeah like that hotel they were staying in just not that dissimilar from the hotel I stayed in</u>
<u n="137" who="S0298">oh no we stayed in really nice hotel but I mean we had er German Marks right so er the hotel we stayed in in er in <anon type="place"/> was really nice it was like some old grand hotel kind of thing and</u>
<u n="138" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0298">mm got a couple of bottles of vodka for er for fifty P and er</u>
<u n="140" who="S0261">yeah and you'd be away</u>
<u n="141" who="S0298">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0261">and that's it a couple of bottles of vodka and cigarettes were a quarter of the price of the bottle of vodka</u>
<u n="143" who="S0262" trans="overlap">two great cities</u>
<u n="144" who="S0298">I know we went into bars and we went to like a really nice restaurant I think we paid like one Mark</u>
<u n="145" who="S0262">really?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0298">and the the toilet lady because I the toilet lady you had to give them a tip and none of us had had <unclear/> right? so I sort of threw one Mark at her thing and er she was <trunc>over</trunc>overvalued because it was like a month's salary on the black market</u>
<u n="147" who="S0261"><vocal desc="laugh"/> wow</u>
<u n="148" who="S0298">it was</u>
<u n="149" who="S0261">wow</u>
<u n="150" who="S0298">pretty pretty extreme</u>
<u n="151" who="S0262">yes yeah so erm but the Poles whocame here but then they went back is that is that what happened?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0298">sorry?</u>
<u n="153" who="S0262">the Poles who came over to England</u>
<u n="154" who="S0298">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0262">were thinking that they were going to find what a job paradise are then</u>
<u n="156" who="S0261" trans="overlap"><unclear>find</unclear> gold</u>
<u n="157" who="S0262">and then and then er apparently they they just thought it was shit and they've moved back</u>
<u n="158" who="S0298">yeah a lot of them moved back yeah</u>
<u n="159" who="S0261">but what's the real reason do you think? it's just that the economy got better in Poland?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0298">yeah mm and when they had an opportunity here they earned some money they were working quite hard and</u>
<u n="161" who="S0261">they got what they needed and went home</u>
<u n="162" who="S0298" trans="overlap">I mean Poland isn't Poland isn't a a bad place to live either so <pause dur="short"/> er I think a lot of them when they were here they were working very hard and er certainly like the sort of trades are better than the er the English counterparts in most cases and they worked harder and more and probably earned more money and then yeah went back right?</u>
<u n="163" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0298">I suppose they have you know enough money to like build a house or whatever so</u>
<u n="167" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0261">has the erm has the economy kind of European economy changed so it's that a lot of work gets outsourced to Poland or?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0298">dunno</u>
<u n="170" who="S0261">I've heard of it kind of being like Romania and Bulgaria and that kind of thing no?</u>
<u n="171" who="S0298">no and it it's not</u>
<u n="172" who="S0261" trans="overlap">it's not something you've heard of</u>
<u n="173" who="S0298">it's not really <pause dur="short"/> I mean Poland is Poland is still very much</u>
<u n="174" who="S0261" trans="overlap">what I know is that some</u>
<u n="175" who="S0298">er I mean it I mean it's A a very large country so it's it's I think the second largest in area size after</u>
<u n="176" who="S0261">Germany</u>
<u n="177" who="S0298">er France</u>
<u n="178" who="S0261">after France okay</u>
<u n="179" who="S0298">yeah er but it's agriculturally it's bigger than France and France is is actually a very agricultural country</u>
<u n="180" who="S0261">yes mm</u>
<u n="181" who="S0298">er but you know I think in the cities there are jobs and stuff so we</u>
<u n="182" who="S0261"><unclear/></u>
<u n="183" who="S0298" trans="overlap">they're they're not like a you know so it's not like sort of I don't think Poland ever was a a sort of a er a cheap labour kind of country unlike erm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0261">Romania or Bulgaria or somewhere like that</u>
<u n="185" who="S0298" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0261">okay</u>
<u n="187" who="S0298">so</u>
<u n="188" who="S0261">but it but I've heard that there's</u>
<u n="189" who="S0298" trans="overlap">because they were always they were always quite you know civilised well well-educated and er so yeah</u>
<u n="190" who="S0261">no yeah of course of course erm</u>
<u n="191" who="S0298">and relatively rich compared to say Bulgaria or Hungaria like even in in er in Soviet times</u>
<u n="192" who="S0261">so there's a big scale difference even in in between those countries?</u>
<u n="193" who="S0298">yeah I mean in in Poland okay you had to queue I mean when my parents were there which was before the with with you had to sometimes you had to queue for like three hours to get a loaf of bread or something like that right?</u>
<u n="194" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="195" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0298">er coffee was er impossible to get so we always had the parcels with coffee and shit like that</u>
<u n="197" who="S0262">yeah wow</u>
<u n="198" who="S0298">but they used it to trade right? and well overall they were you know not too too too bad off I I I think they probably managed the transition reasonably well as well so</u>
<u n="199" who="S0262">well my erm well my business partner <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she was Polish and she showed me her parents' old flat and they were you know in their thirties and forties and it was it was like wow okay it's communist kind of era obviously but it's like but she said you know what it all worked because her dad had a job her mum had a job they had enough money to buy food</u>
<u n="200" who="S0298">we I think in sort of er in the in the Soviet <trunc>e</trunc>era I think East Germany had probably the highest standard of living because they had most most industry erm were were best off from from all of them erm</u>
<u n="201" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="202" who="S0298">and and Poland probably wasn't too far well Poland was a bit off from it but well</u>
<u n="203" who="S0262">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it was a good film considering there wasn't really anything else on to watch anyway <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="204" who="S0298">yeah well I mean I looked through through the list and I thought you're more likely to come to <anon type="place"/> er if there's a film on rather than just saying let's go for a drink kind of thing</u>
<u n="205" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="206" who="S0298">er so I looked at it I said is that it? erm eh</u>

<u n="287" who="S0298">yeah</u>
<u n="288" who="S0262">and that's when Thatcher came down hard on him and he was saying oh look cos he'd been he's gone away to to Russia and he was exiled in Russia and and he apparently wrote this letter to Margaret Thatcher it's quite famous saying dear dear Margaret <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm I know that I'm going to be you know hanged for treason or he wouldn't have been but you know basically I know that I'll be locked up for evermore for for treason but can you just allow me one thing? can I please go to erm a cricket match at The Oval one last time?</u>
