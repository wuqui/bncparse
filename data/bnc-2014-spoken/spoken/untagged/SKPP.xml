<u n="1" who="S0202">oh for fuck's sake</u>
<u n="2" who="S0208">retard</u>
<u n="3" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="4" who="S0208">they've got erm thirty thousand followers</u>
<u n="5" who="S0202">right</u>
<u n="6" who="S0208">and</u>
<u n="7" who="S0202" trans="overlap">and they're following you?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0208">and they follow six thousand people and they started following me and I was like right</u>
<u n="9" who="S0202">I'm a <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="10" who="S0208">no no</u>
<u n="11" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="12" who="S0208">cos I know like I've learnt with pages like that what they do is they follow people and then obviously when it's like follow for follow</u>
<u n="13" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0208" trans="overlap">it's like if someone follows me I'll look through their stuff if they're interesting like yeah I'll follow you back if they're not interesting I'm like oh fuck you but erm cos they were interesting and like I really liked the outfits that they put up and like it was quite trendy</u>
<u n="15" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="16" who="S0208">erm I was like yeah I'll follow you back but then I thought</u>
<u n="17" who="S0202" trans="overlap">then they unfollowed you</u>
<u n="18" who="S0208">that's no no well they didn't but usually that is what happens</u>
<u n="19" who="S0202">right</u>
<u n="20" who="S0208">like some girl from <anon type="place"/> actually has quite a few hundred followers like <pause dur="short"/> now each have started following me she was like a third year or something and I started following her because I was like oh <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0202">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you must do <pause dur="long"/> oh <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="22" who="S0208">mm <pause dur="short"/> but then once I followed her back I re fronted my page and I'd gone down to like a hundred and eighty followers and I was like you fucking bitch sorry I <trunc>apol</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="23" who="S0202">so is that what they do then? they follow you so you follow them back and then they unfollow you?</u>
<u n="24" who="S0208">not not all the time some people do but like</u>
<u n="25" who="S0202">that's really sad</u>
<u n="26" who="S0208">because I don't really care it's like <pause dur="short"/> like it sounds great but it's like I've got a hundred and eighty followers like that's not much <pause dur="short"/> like I don't care</u>
<u n="27" who="S0202">right</u>
<u n="28" who="S0208">and I've made my profile erm public because there's nothing on there that I don't like but I made it public public sorry back when me and <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> were gonna start doing the Youtube video</u>
<u n="29" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0208">so I was in my bio was gonna put my Youtube link I was gonna make it public so that more people would see it</u>
<u n="31" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0208">cos it sounds really sad but what I'm genuinely scared of happening is me putting videos up on Youtube and like and practically no one seeing them or liking them and them just being like a flop <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="33" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="34" who="S0208">know what I mean? so like I made it public <pause dur="short"/> but since I made it public so many more people followed me like I've got forty more followers this summer just from making it public <pause dur="short"/> but I think what it is is like I know personally when I go on Explore cos I love Instagram I love it because I look at all the food stuff all the fitness stuff and just like pretty girls</u>
<u n="35" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0208">it's like one of my hobbies and I just enjoy it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0208"><event desc="unintelligible"/> and erm so I started doing that and that's what I see is that when the person is private I don't bother adding them cos I don't know what their photos are like I don't know if I'm gonna enjoy following them</u>
<u n="39" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0208">I don't like I don't like stuffing up on my news feed for no reason</u>
<u n="41" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0208">I like enjoying the pictures whereas when they're public and I can look through their pictures and I can see if I get a sense if I like following them</u>
<u n="43" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0208">or if I like the pictures that they're gonna pin up</u>
<u n="45" who="S0202">yeah I know what you mean</u>
<u n="46" who="S0208">so I started doing the same cos there's <trunc>noth</trunc> there's nothing on there that needs to be hidden <pause dur="short"/> er it's not like Facebook where it has to go like private</u>
<u n="47" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0208">yeah like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> thanks <pause dur="short"/> thank you she's got mm <pause dur="short"/> two thousand and something followers</u>
<u n="49" who="S0202">cos she's makeup and stuff innit?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0208">that is from her Youtube videos</u>
<u n="51" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0208">like a lot of like sometimes I read the comments on pictures I can see a picture of her that's really beautiful and you comment and I read the other ones and it's people who are like oh you're so beautiful your videos inspire me blah blah blah and she's always so lovely back to them thing is she gets gift packages from her followers</u>
<u n="53" who="S0202">really?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0208">on Youtube yeah cos she does makeup and stuff like a fashion blog she's <trunc>d</trunc>done a bit of music erm <pause dur="short"/> she gets packages from people cos like when she puts on like <pause dur="short"/> she does these videos where it's like her summer favourites or her autumn favourites or stuff like that and she'll say like all her products that she likes using and the clothes she likes <pause dur="short"/> she's gotten a few packages from like her followers and like people who like her fans basically and they sent her packages with her like her favourite stuff in</u>
<u n="55" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0208">and it is so cute like when I was at hers the last time and she explained to me and she was like yeah I got this from a follower and it's like that's my favourite lipstick and she's sent it to me and stuff like the <trunc>t</trunc> she gets packages in the post</u>
<u n="57" who="S0202">how do they know her address?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0208">probably look her up and find it</u>
<u n="59" who="S0202">that's creepy</u>
<u n="60" who="S0208">it's it's</u>
<u n="61" who="S0202">it's sweet and it's really nice like I would love that</u>
<u n="62" who="S0208">it's</u>
<u n="63" who="S0202" trans="overlap">if like having people</u>
<u n="64" who="S0208">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0202" trans="overlap">it's creepy</u>
<u n="66" who="S0208">but it is really sweet and like all the people that she talks to on Instagram like the people who she replies comments to are like oh thank you love you're so sweet and she's met loads of other bloggers</u>
<u n="67" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0208">mm <pause dur="short"/> like from it like <pause dur="short"/> really famous bloggers and like she left a a comment saying had a dinner date with and like tagged it so I just looked like out of interest and this person had like twenty-one thousand followers <pause dur="short"/> like on Youtube like subscribers and I was like wow like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s met them and like I genuinely reckon that she's gonna break into like internet business</u>
<u n="69" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0208">because she's got that style about her to be a blogger and to be like being famous on internet isn't big but there's a girl that a follow called Christian Bazan</u>
<u n="71" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0208">and she <pause dur="short"/> is she's stunning and she does beauty stuff and she started off as a beauty blogger and she did blogs and like put pictures up and stuff and now she's been recruited by some agency that's called Kayture On The Go</u>
<u n="73" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="74" who="S0208">and she travels the world she goes to different countries and she wears their like like their culture and she like she wears different outfits and like she's gotten famous and is paid for that and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s a few <trunc>subscr</trunc> well a few I'd say like a couple of hundred <pause dur="short"/> a couple of hundred subscribers away on Youtube to be paid to make videos</u>
<u n="75" who="S0202">really?</u>
<u n="76" who="S0208">cos when you get to I think it's three thousand or three thousand five hundred or something around that mark when you get to that many subscribers Youtube pays you to make videos because they get people in to like pay for advert time</u>
<u n="77" who="S0202">adverts yeah and that's when your videos start getting adverts on</u>
<u n="78" who="S0208">exactly so she's almost hit that point where her videos she's gonna be paid to do them</u>
<u n="79" who="S0202">really?</u>
<u n="80" who="S0208">and when when she came to <anon type="place"/> and she told me that <pause dur="short"/> sorry keeping it lit erm <pause dur="short"/> she got approached by a beauty company like a makeup company erm who approached her and sent her an email and was like we want you to erm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0202" trans="overlap">promote our product</u>
<u n="82" who="S0208">promote our product so just basically use our product and promote it and tell <trunc>y</trunc> tell er tell people what you think and I don't know if she's done it yet I'm not sure if it was like you need a few more subscribers to do it or can you do it whatever? but she told me that someone had approached her asking her to do that so she did it and she got loads more subscribers but can you imagine she's being paid like at first it's not much like don't get me wrong but</u>
<u n="83" who="S0202" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0208">there's a girl that I follow on Instagram I didn't know she did Youtube videos <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and her Youtube name is Velvet Ghost <pause dur="short"/> she does the most random videos but they're so much fun to like watch</u>

<u n="88" who="S0208">and like it's just it's just really lovely like it brings people together</u>
<u n="89" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0208">like I really really love that and that's why I wanted to start doing videos but for my music cos like I've wanted to do that for a while I've been too shy</u>
<u n="91" who="S0202">why though? cos er you're on the internet it's not</u>
<u n="92" who="S0208" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0202">you don't even have to put your face on it you can just like</u>
<u n="94" who="S0208">I know it's</u>
<u n="95" who="S0202">blur that part out sort of thing like</u>
<u n="96" who="S0208" trans="overlap">I know</u>
<u n="97" who="S0202">you don't even need to you know</u>

<u n="136" who="S0208">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0202">if you were the sort of person that were to turn around and say oh <trunc>y</trunc> I know like I'm so amazing like</u>
<u n="138" who="S0208"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="141" who="S0202" trans="overlap">make you a dickhead it's not attractive but the fact that you don't know it and the fact that you're so insecure receiving compliments makes it more clear that you are a beautiful person</u>

<u n="146" who="S0208">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0202">like I genuinely believe that you are a beautiful person and sometimes I wonder why you're my friend and</u>
<u n="148" who="S0208" trans="overlap">why?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0202" trans="overlap">I genuinely think that cos <pause dur="short"/> yeah just</u>

<u n="151" who="S0202" trans="overlap">insecurities</u>
<u n="152" who="S0208">I see a lot of myself in you <pause dur="short"/> but mostly I see a lot of my personality in you but it's parts of my parts of my personality that I would never show</u>
<u n="153" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="154" who="S0208">I think that's what drew me to you at first is because I'd love to be outgoing and I'm really outgoing with the people that know me <pause dur="short"/> but with strangers I'm not like when you were so outgoing with strangers and so came to my door and so easily made friends so this is the kind of person I need to be with because you'll you bring out like the better side of me</u>
<u n="155" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0208">if you know what I mean <pause dur="short"/> whereas if I was to hang out with another shy person it would be awkward like erm <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s friend <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> <pause dur="short"/> I had a absolutely fantastic night when I went out with them that was the first night I went out with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> black <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="157" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="158" who="S0208">and all of that lot <pause dur="short"/> and that was the night that erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> invited me to live with them</u>
<u n="159" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0208">because they were like oh we love you so much you have to live with us and I was like well thank you but I'm previously engaged</u>
<u n="161" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="162" who="S0208">I said that because I knew I was gonna live with you</u>
<u n="163" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0208">and because you didn't know then yet wasn't gonna be like okay but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> has to come cos they didn't know you</u>
<u n="165" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0208">so I just like yeah thanks I'm previously engaged <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="168" who="S0208">but erm that was the first night I went out with them but <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> is basically very much socially awkward like I am but all the same things so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and me and her I was already ready cos I'd came down for pre drinks it was about nine o'clock in the evening and I went down to her flat and I was in her room with her and I was getting to know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and like I saw the pictures on her wall and I was like used to go to school with that girl cos she went to erm <anon type="place"/> and I went to <anon type="place"/> high school and they were two private schools in the same town two girls' schools but right next to each other</u>
<u n="169" who="S0202">mm</u>

<u n="662" who="S0202" trans="overlap">and you stood up in a different way</u>
<u n="663" who="S0208">I I guess that's just kind of how I use myself it's like I will always show support where it's needed <pause dur="short"/> but like I'm not the kind of person that will put myself out there and say stuff and as <trunc>mu</trunc> no matter how much I try and rectify that or try and stand up</u>

<u n="665" who="S0208" trans="overlap">not not only for myself though it's just for you it's for myself I'm not even capable of saying stuff for myself like when I heard <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> saying that stuff I still didn't say something it was for myself <pause dur="short"/> well I just can't do it but</u>
<u n="666" who="S0202">no and I understand that and it's like I mean <pause dur="short"/> the hardest part for me well like I've said to this I've said this to you so many times I were twenty-two I were going into an environment where I were gonna be surrounded by eighteen year olds</u>
<u n="667" who="S0208" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="668" who="S0202">and everything was so perfect like you remember that little white board that we had?</u>
<u n="669" who="S0208">yeah</u>
<u n="670" who="S0202">like erm so and so in this flat</u>
<u n="671" who="S0208">put all our names on it</u>
<u n="672" who="S0202" trans="overlap">love so and so in four 0 seven and it was so nice and then as soon as <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> came into the situation everything changed and it just</u>
<u n="673" who="S0208" trans="overlap">not <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> just <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="674" who="S0202">no just not even <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="675" who="S0208" trans="overlap">because I don't know if I told you this but <pause dur="short"/> ages ago I mean like it was a while after all of that shit happened <pause dur="short"/> a long time after that I mean it was just before it happened with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> just before exams and stuff I was going to uni and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was obviously going up at the same time and we got into the elevator er elevator? am I American?</u>
<u n="676" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="677" who="S0208">got into the lift together and it was it was so awkward I mean I wasn't gonna say anything because well as much as I I don't have the guts to stick up for people that I love and stuff I have the guts to just remain silent so like I like I'm like my mum I'm very much like my mum I like to please people</u>
<u n="678" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="679" who="S0208">whether I like them or not I like to be liked and that's one of my faults I I I need to be liked</u>
<u n="680" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="681" who="S0208">so that's probably one of the reasons why I always stay silent but when we go into the lift I didn't say anything and I didn't look in her direction and I was like this is awkward but I'm I'm staying silent I was like I don't need to please this person I don't like this person and she started talking to me and she was like hi <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> so I knew it was obviously directed at me and I was like hi didn't wanna be rude erm but then when I was like in my head I was like why am I even speaking to this person? why am I giving her the time of day it was like so what if I'm rude to her? I was like she's been so rude to my friend but then instantly she was like I'm so sorry for everything that's happened like instantly <pause dur="short"/> and she wasn't with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I sort of that's when I sort of started to realise I was like you really are a lapdog I didn't say it but I was like I don't want your apology she was like no but I I feel genuinely bad about everything that's happened and I was like I don't care and she was like so I know I I haven't spoken to you in a while but like how is everything how are you? and she seemed genuinely</u>
<u n="682" who="S0202">interested</u>
<u n="683" who="S0208">like no worried like genuinely worried</u>
<u n="684" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="685" who="S0208">and I was like things could be better thanks like I was being short and I was</u>
<u n="686" who="S0202" trans="overlap">civil</u>
<u n="687" who="S0208">I was proud of myself in that moment because usually I would be civil as fuck but to this person I just I felt like I owed her nothing <pause dur="short"/> and I feel really bad because we were walking to uni together we were in the lift together we were going up the steps together and when we got to the top of the steps she kept walking straight and I walked over the cross lights but I always walk over that way anyway</u>
<u n="688" who="S0202">yeah we both do it's a habit yeah</u>
<u n="689" who="S0208">but she was I could tell she was trying and I just wasn't interested and I was like this is my time to rectify all those times I didn't stick up for you like do you know what I mean? because</u>
<u n="690" who="S0202" trans="overlap">but I don't need you to stick up for me</u>
<u n="691" who="S0208" trans="overlap">no I know</u>
<u n="692" who="S0202" trans="overlap">but like in my head</u>
<u n="693" who="S0208" trans="overlap">and you're saying you're saying this now <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="694" who="S0202" trans="overlap">in my head it's like</u>

<u n="696" who="S0202" trans="overlap">I wanted you to but then</u>
<u n="697" who="S0208" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="698" who="S0202" trans="overlap">I think to myself I don't need anyone to stick up for me because end of the day I did nothing wrong I did nothing to deserve that the thing is with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she doesn't like other people being looked at she doesn't like other people being pretty</u>
<u n="699" who="S0208">no but <trunc>h</trunc></u>

<u n="702" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="703" who="S0208">and that's when I tried to make a difference but I'm just I'm not that person no matter what someone does to me or as well as awful as it sounds especially to someone else because if someone does something awful to someone else as awful as it sounds they didn't do it to me</u>
<u n="704" who="S0202">yeah</u>

<u n="756" who="S0202" trans="overlap">or didn't deserve you were there as my friend you're still my friend now you know? and you didn't have to be the easy way out would have been do what <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> did going and being friends with them and not being my friend</u>
<u n="757" who="S0208">I wouldn't have done that ever</u>
<u n="758" who="S0202">exactly and that's your way of sticking up for me and being my friend</u>

<u n="760" who="S0202">it doesn't matter</u>
<u n="761" who="S0208">through you helping me and showing me that it's okay to stick up for yourself and it's okay to get angry at people it's not the end of the world <pause dur="short"/> because I I guess that from where I came from it's it was it was quite an enclosed environment like with my parents and my friends <pause dur="long"/></u>

<u n="763" who="S0208">so because I had had quite a closed upbringing and was so different to your situation I just want you to know that you have helped me to find the voice that I guess I've always wanted to have but I've been too scared to voice if you know what I mean it sounds really weird but because what I lived through with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and all that like I did I did stick up for myself for six months we didn't talk I literally couldn't look at her the silence I get I think that silence is my worst weapon because people always accept me to be that sweet person that's always gonna be forgiving or that I think the silence is the worse treatment I can give someone</u>
<u n="764" who="S0202">it is because I'm not being funny or anything but <pause dur="short"/> I wish that I'd have just not given them any er recognition at all</u>
<u n="765" who="S0208">but I think that's the worse I think that's the <trunc>wor</trunc> well <pause dur="short"/> I think that because I feel it's the worst treatment someone can give me when someone's mad at me and the silent treatment</u>
<u n="766" who="S0202">it's the worst</u>
<u n="767" who="S0208">it's the worst feeling I can have because I'd rather someone shout at me and me explain my side or me shout back than silence and I think you and seeing how the way you handle things and learning about your upbringing and just a completely different side to what I've ever lived through has helped me find it and this summer with all the shit that's gone through with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> when I was actually proud of myself for doing this because when I stood up to her and told her every single thing I had on my chest against her</u>
<u n="768" who="S0202" trans="overlap">and I was I'm proud of you as well</u>

<u n="770" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah you worked it out</u>
<u n="771" who="S0208">not even an awkwardness because she wanted to hear it and I was ready to say it it made me realise that I've got nothing to be afraid of by standing up for myself and that's because of you <pause dur="short"/> so I want you to know that if anything happens if ever I run into any of those girls or if ever they say something to me I'll be ready to say something back and if ever you have any problem with anyone else I'm I'm ready to stick up for you it's like</u>

<u n="773" who="S0208" trans="overlap">I had to live through this year of being naïve and being the sweet little shy girl or whatever to actually realise that life doesn't work like that you can't be nice to everyone and not everyone's gonna like you and I had to learn that but I learnt it from you because my parents have given me a sheltered upbringing and I have had that all through my life because I've never had to live through it do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="774" who="S0202">yeah</u>
