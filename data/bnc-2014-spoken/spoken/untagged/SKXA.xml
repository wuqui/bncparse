<u n="909" who="S0618">they work right through <pause dur="short"/> and having the conversation about how we felt that even if we were paid till five or work officially ended at five we should stay till six or seven or eight or nine to demonstrate some kind of dedication to the role well <pause dur="short"/> fuck that <pause dur="short"/> really and I I really it really brought home to me I've got a German friend who runs an ashfelt business <pause dur="short"/> and he must be worth millions he's got an extraordinary successful company he runs out of Berlin and Düsseldorf erm does a lot of work in China et cetera et cetera blah blah blah <pause dur="short"/> he works fewer than forty hours a week</u>

<u n="911" who="S0618">and I think that's great and I think <pause dur="short"/> no it wasn't him another German friend first said to me if you can't do your work in eight hours you're not sufficiently efficient <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="912" who="S0619">mm hm</u>
<u n="913" who="S0618">hallelujah</u>
<u n="914" who="S0619">yeah that's a good point</u>
<u n="915" who="S0618">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but the northern Europeans seem to be leading the way on that with more emphasis on family and less of an emphasis on work</u>
<u n="916" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="917" who="S0618">it's good</u>
<u n="918" who="S0619">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I don't know because <pause dur="short"/> I don't know where I'm gonna go with this sentence</u>
<u n="919" who="S0618"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="920" who="S0619">I'm really sorry I'm just working it out first before I continue <pause dur="short"/> erm I've always worked extremely hard but I've always known that fundamentally I'm quite a lazy person and if I can get away with the bare minimum <pause dur="short"/> erm I'm not a sort of I'm not a lazy person in terms of erm what I do in a day</u>
<u n="921" who="S0618">uhu</u>
<u n="922" who="S0619">but lazy in terms of er <pause dur="short"/> why do I need to do this? <vocal desc="laugh"/> sorry why am I working so much?</u>
<u n="923" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="924" who="S0619">erm <pause dur="short"/> so in that way I think I'm quite lazy and I can always draw the line and go right that's enough and I did it on CELTA I did it when I was a student I'm you know trying to do it now</u>
<u n="925" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="926" who="S0619">and you go right enough's enough sorry it's my time now bye</u>
<u n="927" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="928" who="S0619">erm and it's you know it's not easy to do and not everybody does it er but I've always been really sort of self aware of work not running into your normal life</u>
<u n="929" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="930" who="S0619">and in this job it's hard you know you're working at home or preparing at home</u>
<u n="931" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="932" who="S0619">where is that sort of erm <pause dur="short"/> line drawn</u>
<u n="933" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> where do you draw the line? yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I seem to remember you saying at some point that you'd set an alarm for your lesson prep time</u>
<u n="934" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no on a timer</u>
<u n="935" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="936" who="S0619">and once the timer goes off then</u>
<u n="937" who="S0618">stop preparing</u>
<u n="938" who="S0619">stop preparing it's either finished or it's not and if it's not it's your own fault <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="939" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="940" who="S0619">er and yeah that's the only way I can do it</u>
<u n="941" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> if you got the first part of your lesson planned I I think that's quite often <pause dur="short"/> sufficient</u>
<u n="942" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="943" who="S0618">cos lesson <pause dur="short"/> depending on the students depending on the day can go off on different tangents anyway</u>
<u n="944" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="945" who="S0618">so if you've planned the entirety of it you maybe have less flexibility then sometimes</u>
<u n="946" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="947" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="948" who="S0619">er you can't say <pause dur="short"/> do it all in eight hours because if you're teaching for</u>
<u n="949" who="S0618"><vocal desc="laugh"/> eight and a half</u>
<u n="950" who="S0619" trans="overlap">six hours <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah you can't necessarily do it all in</u>
<u n="951" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="952" who="S0619">erm that remaining two hours but you can have a go</u>
<u n="953" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I guess it's different with the job that you have because some days you will teach a lot of hours other days you will teach far fewer hours</u>
<u n="954" who="S0619">yeah and do the planning then</u>
<u n="955" who="S0618" trans="overlap">and it's yeah up to you to then balance when you do the planning so day is like the next day</u>
<u n="956" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> yep so it's all</u>
<u n="957" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="958" who="S0619">falls into place erm <pause dur="short"/> can't remember what I was <pause dur="short"/> originally gonna say before we started on that dunno <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> don't know if I can do it <pause dur="short"/> I've seen the effects of what happens if you work too much erm <pause dur="short"/> and you know it sort of ruins your life ruins your health and your mental health <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="959" who="S0618" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="960" who="S0619">you know and I compare myself to friends who live in London for example and they don't have enough time in the day to do anything</u>
<u n="961" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="962" who="S0619">you know they're on an hour commute on public transport er transport working all day <pause dur="short"/> more than they should <pause dur="short"/> for what to make money for someone else</u>
<u n="963" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="964" who="S0619">it's just a bit pants er and <pause dur="short"/> and you know and then me thinking oh god should I be doing be more? would I be making more money if I was doing more? would I be happier? no probably not so <pause dur="short"/> find the line <pause dur="short"/> find what's right for you</u>
<u n="965" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah exactly I do think also depends on the individual and what's right for you I think for me at the time when I had my er <pause dur="short"/> period of a number of years of working crazy hours <pause dur="short"/> I think in a way that was right for me at the time I got such a buzz off of it</u>
<u n="966" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="967" who="S0618">I got such a kick out of it <pause dur="short"/> you know it was stressful but I was kind of like an adrenaline junkie</u>
<u n="968" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="969" who="S0618">yeah and I always <trunc>fel</trunc></u>
<u n="970" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah and people say they feel like that as well</u>
<u n="971" who="S0618">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I had jobs that were you know sort of semi physical as well you know my day job was furniture <trunc>re</trunc>recycling <pause dur="short"/> charitable organisation and quite often I'd be driving the van or carrying washing machines up</u>
<u n="972" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah lugging the furniture yeah</u>
<u n="973" who="S0618">three flights of stairs and things like that <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and then I'd go home have something to eat have a nap and my night job would be washing up in a pub restaurant waitressing bar work</u>
<u n="974" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="975" who="S0618">so that's very physical as well <pause dur="short"/> erm and I did have a fair bit of paperwork cos I was the boss of the charitable jobs so I had to do all that accounting stuff and whatnot as well so you know I had the brain stimulation but I think importantly had the physical stuff</u>
<u n="976" who="S0619">mm hm</u>
<u n="977" who="S0618">whereas I think in other jobs where I've worked a lot of hours and it's just been desk based I've really struggled with that because I haven't been able to move my body</u>
<u n="978" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="979" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="980" who="S0619">yeah that's <unclear/></u>
<u n="981" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="982" who="S0619" trans="overlap">and in terms of you saying <pause dur="short"/> erm working more so that you look as though you're really dedicated and committed</u>
<u n="983" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="984" who="S0619">I think there is other ways to <pause dur="short"/> to show that without having to work</u>
<u n="985" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="986" who="S0619">more and more and especially in this job it's simply by saying it to the boss I say to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> all the time oh look here's what I'm doing to improve myself</u>
<u n="987" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="988" who="S0619">erm and like I'm not saying I'm doing it to <pause dur="short"/> I don't know to play games or to sort of look like I'm faking it in order to you know <pause dur="short"/> give this false impression of how much work I'm doing <pause dur="short"/> I am doing it</u>
<u n="989" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you are doing it <pause dur="short"/> yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="990" who="S0619">but I'm making sure that I'm fucking telling her because erm</u>
<u n="991" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah good for you</u>
<u n="992" who="S0619">you know she's the one who's going be writing references for me so I need her to see</u>
<u n="993" who="S0618">I'm sure she would mind if you added onto the end of that sentence just remember this when you're writing my reference please</u>
<u n="994" who="S0619">well yeah I'm I'm</u>
<u n="995" who="S0618">she's the sort of person I imagine you could say that to</u>
<u n="996" who="S0619">yeah and like I've not said it like that but I'm writing her a list and when I say is it okay if you write my references? here's the things I think are important</u>
<u n="997" who="S0618">definitely</u>
<u n="998" who="S0619">or would you consider putting them in?</u>
<u n="999" who="S0618">definitely</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0619">you know</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0619">it's not like I'm telling her what to write and it's just you know she's busy she's got so many teachers</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0618">exactly</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0619">she might forget all the times I've done X Y Z</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0618">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I I think as a busy person she'll really appreciate you giving her an outline of what you'd like to see in your reference</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah giving her <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0618">saves her having to sit and think so <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0619">so</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0618">and you're right she won't remember it all and she's got a few hundred teachers so <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0619">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so yeah it doesn't <pause dur="short"/> hours behind a desk <pause dur="short"/> doesn't really show dedication I think other things should</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0618" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0619">I don't know it depends on the job I guess</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0618" trans="overlap">it seems to be a sort of an equation with a bit of victimhood and martyrdom erm</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0619" trans="overlap">in what way?</u>
<u n="1015" who="S0618">seem to equate with hard work or you know oh I'm so tired oh I'm really sick erm</u>
<u n="1016" who="S0619">mm hm</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0618">oh I was working till midnight last night <pause dur="short"/> well <pause dur="short"/> more fool you you mug really</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0619">mm hm</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0618">and I don't you know maybe some bosses are impressed by that maybe that is a mark of dedication</u>
<u n="1020" who="S0619">if I was a boss I'd be like bloody hell get a life <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1021" who="S0618">yeah I would think that shows such a</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0619" trans="overlap">I'd be a terrible boss probably</u>
<u n="1023" who="S0618" trans="overlap">such a such a lack of respect of self really</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> mm hm</u>
<u n="1025" who="S0618">it's not necessarily a quality that you want to see in people</u>
<u n="1026" who="S0619">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1027" who="S0618">yeah actually saying that when I worked for <pause dur="short"/> a big charity in England I had er one manager who was in seven every morning didn't get paid until nine <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="1028" who="S0619">mm hm</u>
<u n="1029" who="S0618">but I think it kind of suited her as far as traffic and transport and getting lift and travel and things like that went</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0618">and she didn't lord it as a symbol of martyrdom but I used to say to her you're a mug you know you're a complete mug don't expect anybody <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know I was her boss</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> yeah to recognise it or</u>
<u n="1033" who="S0618" trans="overlap">but I was saying it to her you know obviously we had a good relationship and I express my appreciation and gratitude for the wonderful work that she did she was the best manager on the team by far but I'd say to her don't expect anybody to thank you for this don't expect anybody to recognise or appreciate this</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0619" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah nobody owes you anything</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0618">no exactly so if you do it you do it for yourself if you expect anything you're a mug</u>

<u n="1038" who="S0619">other than going to work earlier and they don't owe you for it</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0618" trans="overlap">and <pause dur="short"/> she's clearly showing how she doesn't respect herself so why should anybody else respect her?</u>
