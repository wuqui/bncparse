<u n="768" who="S0012">er</u>
<u n="769" who="S0278">cos you turn the tap on it turned how many years ago?</u>
<u n="770" who="S0013">when were we there? erm about three years ago now</u>

<u n="774" who="S0278">and the <trunc>alar</trunc> ah I couldn't <trunc>bel</trunc> this <trunc>mor</trunc> yesterday morning about five o'clock what whose alarm's going off now and there was a beep beep beep beep okay and I could hear it when erm I had I now know that one of my ears isn't good I could hear it louder when I put one <trunc>hear</trunc>ear down then the other <trunc>e</trunc>ear down on the pillow and and I thought well if someone's got their alarm going off in their suitcase or in their in their bag and no one did it eventually and it went on and on and in the end I slept through it a bit and I woke up and it was still going</u>
<u n="775" who="S0013">oh gosh</u>
<u n="776" who="S0278">then when I got downstairs it's the alarm panel that you put a key in</u>

<u n="778" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="779" who="S0278">that was beeping</u>
<u n="780" who="S0013">well</u>
<u n="781" who="S0278">erm and so I now know that one of my ears isn't right because when one was faced downwards towards towards it I could hear it and when the other turned around I couldn't hear it when the other my other ear was down</u>
<u n="782" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="783" who="S0278">and I've come to the conclusion somebody had perhaps left an alarm in the bedding or something one of the beds that wasn't being used</u>
<u n="784" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="785" who="S0278">only on the last night it did it</u>

<u n="791" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="792" who="S0278">perhaps someone smoked in the room and they shouldn't have done or something I don't know</u>
<u n="793" who="S0012">a lot of the problem is erm</u>
<u n="794" who="S0013">not many people do that</u>
<u n="795" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="796" who="S0013">you're not supposed to smoke most people I don't know anyone that's done that</u>
<u n="797" who="S0012" trans="overlap">a lot of the problem with that with that is people who use hairspray</u>

<u n="799" who="S0012">and that will set the alarm off</u>
<u n="800" who="S0278">mm</u>

<u n="952" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="953" who="S0278">erm but there are some who just can't fathom that and they they have have their their notes are coloured so they you know they know that they're orange but you've always got the one on the line is your left hand and the one on the gap on the stave is your right hand so they they're just marked where they are they know if it's on the line it's that hand like that <vocal desc="misc"/> and then you damp or <vocal desc="misc"/> damp it or if you want a sound for a long time <vocal desc="misc"/> damp it</u>
<u n="954" who="S0013">hmm</u>
<u n="955" who="S0278">it's such a laugh but so there's really only three of us that can read music properly but even on on some of the ones who just have it marked it's easier if you mark the colours but you keeping putting it on a different note but if and because you can have a whole load of bells ringing if you can have the whole erm twelve bells all say ringing all at once or something then you can't find your note or ten of them's ringing <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> if they're all put in one big straight line on one one clef</u>
