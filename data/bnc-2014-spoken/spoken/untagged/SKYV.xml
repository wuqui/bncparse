<u n="4" who="S0179"></u>
<u n="5" who="S0058">you're just gonna go in this way now</u>
<u n="6" who="S0179">do you want to think about that question? This one</u>
<u n="7" who="S0058">oh sorry yeah <pause dur="short"/> huh <pause dur="short"/> huh</u>
<u n="8" who="S0179">no actually</u>
<u n="9" who="S0058">hmm</u>
<u n="10" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0058">ah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0179">okay so what do you think of that <trunc>wh</trunc> <anon type="place"/> idea?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0058">the <anon type="place"/> idea? Um yeah I quite like it <pause dur="short"/> what are the er cottages like? Are they?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0179">are they you know the quality is very good</u>
<u n="15" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="16" who="S0179">er it's not <pause dur="short"/> or as in it wasn't <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't out and out luxurious</u>
<u n="17" who="S0058">uh-huh</u>
<u n="18" who="S0179">in the same way that sort of maybe newer and swisher ones are so we're gonna have our own <pause dur="short"/> I think they've now pretty much all got flatscreen TVs <pause dur="short"/> they don't have their our own hot tubs</u>
<u n="19" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0179">and that sort of thing</u>
<u n="21" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0179">erm but they're very very comfortable</u>
<u n="23" who="S0058">uh-huh</u>
<u n="24" who="S0179">erm they certainly er you know used to be er very good taste</u>
<u n="25" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0179"><unclear/> taste I used used to so</u>
<u n="27" who="S0058">hmm mm</u>
<u n="28" who="S0179">erm nowadays <pause dur="short"/> but I think they're all gonna been heavily modernised since I was last there anyway</u>
<u n="29" who="S0058">oh right okay so</u>
<u n="30" who="S0179">Cos then erm I erm we used to go to Pen Cywm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0179">from when I was at sixth form onwards <pause dur="short"/> so I haven't actually been to the complex itself maybe seven years</u>
<u n="33" who="S0058">yeah so <pause dur="short"/> they probably have all been</u>
<u n="34" who="S0179">well we can see from the pictures</u>
<u n="35" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0179">erm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> erm so I mean yeah pros and cons I guess <pause dur="short"/> I guess er nice cottage you know <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I mean I think the the main thing is it's not worth obviously we're not gonna go if they won't give us it for</u>
<u n="38" who="S0179">yes although to be fair it would be very little more expensive than the other one would have been just to have this one for the weekend and not use it</u>
<u n="39" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's ridiculous isn't it <pause dur="short"/> huh</u>
<u n="40" who="S0179">we could of course just have it for a week</u>
<u n="41" who="S0058">yeah I mean we could try and ask them and see if we can get it</u>
<u n="42" who="S0179">Don't I mean we could just go</u>
<u n="43" who="S0058" trans="overlap">or just go for the week yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> we could do <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0179">have the entirety of a week off</u>
<u n="45" who="S0058">so yeah <pause dur="short"/> so I mean if we do it Friday to Friday then we'd only need to have</u>
<u n="46" who="S0179" trans="overlap">still driving and fuel conserving petrol</u>
<u n="47" who="S0058">ha ha</u>
<u n="48" who="S0179">er it would be three to four days</u>
<u n="49" who="S0058"><unclear/> you need to have four days off <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="50" who="S0179">I think I'm not sure that's what I want to do particularly at the moment <pause dur="short"/> I think the idea about not taking leave is quite</u>
<u n="51" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> wow</u>
<u n="52" who="S0179">oh deer</u>
<u n="53" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh deer</u>
<u n="54" who="S0179">I though it was a fox to start with</u>
<u n="55" who="S0058">yeah I did yeah</u>
<u n="56" who="S0179">poor thing it was probably trapped on that side</u>
<u n="57" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> ah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0179">not hugely bright admittedly</u>
<u n="59" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="60" who="S0179">unlike the car lights which are coming towards it</u>
<u n="61" who="S0058">huh huh</u>
<u n="62" who="S0179">see what I did there?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0058">I did see what you did there <pause dur="short"/> very good</u>
<u n="64" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> I'm driving in high efficiency mode at the moment <pause dur="short"/> it's weird</u>
<u n="65" who="S0058">ha ha <pause dur="short"/> just automatically?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0179">well no I meant sort of in that situation</u>
<u n="67" who="S0058">you started off?</u>
<u n="68" who="S0179">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="69" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> get into the mind set <pause dur="short"/> yeah um I agree with you actually <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure I particularly wanna have time off <pause dur="short"/> I think a short break would really do the job</u>
<u n="70" who="S0179">yeah exactly I'm not sure it's</u>
<u n="71" who="S0058">I mean it's pointless taking leave for the sake of it <pause dur="short"/> if</u>
<u n="72" who="S0179">yeah I mean if it is <pause dur="short"/> it's not necessarily that much further driving-wise but if feels like it like mentally <pause dur="short"/> cos I've got so used to doing that drive up north</u>
<u n="73" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0179">so it feels like it's not a long way but obviously it is</u>
<u n="75" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes it is  it is  a long drive <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0179">it would be a complete change</u>
<u n="77" who="S0058">yeah it would and it it would be maybe nice in the sense that we wouldn't feel like we kind of had to do anything</u>
<u n="78" who="S0179">yeah I mean cos er there's so much there to do and I've done it all already</u>
<u n="79" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> we could just chill out <pause dur="short"/> do the things we want to <pause dur="short"/> there's no pressure to go anywhere or see anyone <pause dur="short"/> we don't know anyone in <anon type="place"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0179">and we could go up to Aberystwyth sort of bit of retail therapy such as it is</u>
<u n="81" who="S0058" trans="overlap">indeed <pause dur="short"/> well I er yeah I'd quite like to do that <pause dur="short"/> erm and yeah have a wonder around Aberystwyth <pause dur="short"/> go to the beach and mess about <pause dur="short"/> go shopping <pause dur="short"/> get loads of nice things from erm and do some stuff with Leith's Cookery Bible</u>
<u n="82" who="S0179">some champagne</u>
<u n="83" who="S0058">some champagne <pause dur="short"/> bit of chilling <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean no hot tub but if the weather's not gonna be great then you you know it might not of particularly been the best thing anyway <pause dur="short"/> and it's pointless discounting the cottage on that basis <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="84" who="S0179">well they do have a pool <pause dur="short"/> which probably won't be open</u>
<u n="85" who="S0058" trans="overlap">they do have a pool? Ooh <pause dur="short"/> oh you mean an outdoor pool?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="87" who="S0058">ah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0179">like I said probably not gonna be open <pause dur="short"/> I'll continue my economy version cos I'm not braking down here <pause dur="short"/> I'm covering the brake as we're going across this T junction</u>
<u n="89" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0179">Cos there are no speed cameras and therefore I'm just gonna allow the car to bring itself down to speed <pause dur="long"/> I wouldn't normally do it but it's very clear</u>
<u n="91" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah um <pause dur="short"/> I think  I think  that could be quite nice to be honest <pause dur="short"/> I'd quite like to do that</u>
<u n="92" who="S0179">oh we were gonna get through on the lights so we didn't have to brake there</u>
<u n="93" who="S0058">nice <pause dur="short"/> very efficient</u>
<u n="94" who="S0179">I know <pause dur="short"/> extremely efficient <pause dur="short"/> we could go down the motorway but um we'll just go through the centre because we can have a better look at the garage I'm curious</u>
<u n="95" who="S0058">and it should be quiet</u>
<u n="96" who="S0179">yes indeed <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> what were you saying about <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0058" trans="overlap">erm yeah <anon type="place"/> I think  I think  that could be <trunc>c</trunc> really nice actually <pause dur="short"/> very relaxing <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0179">wander down the ah because it's in the village we can wander down the pub in the evenings</u>
<u n="99" who="S0058">ah <pause dur="short"/> fabulous cos <anon type="place"/> you really can't do that</u>
<u n="100" who="S0179">you can <pause dur="short"/> it's just not easy</u>
<u n="101" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh that'd be nice yeah <pause dur="short"/> wander down the pub and then come back and have some dinner</u>
<u n="102" who="S0179">the erm yeah <anon type="place"/> has actually got a erm balcony overlooking the valley</u>
<u n="103" who="S0058">ah that sounds quite nice</u>
<u n="104" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="105" who="S0058">yeah I agree with you that <anon type="place"/> might be a bit weird but any of the other two</u>
<u n="106" who="S0179">either of the other two</u>
<u n="107" who="S0058">either of the other two might be nice <pause dur="short"/> which gives it a bit <trunc>mo</trunc> you know gives us a little more hope that neither of them will go <pause dur="short"/> or one er sorry one of them will be available</u>
<u n="108" who="S0179">yeah they're both the same price which is a very sensible pricing structure</u>
<u n="109" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean I think it's worth just asking them if they can do a short break <pause dur="short"/> because we don't want it for a week <pause dur="short"/> erm yeah <pause dur="short"/> does that sound? And just see what they say I mean</u>
<u n="110" who="S0179">they probably will do I mean unfortunately it's no longer <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> cos they'd definitely have done it</u>
<u n="111" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> do you know I mean does your mam know these people at all? No? Dammit</u>
<u n="112" who="S0179">erm <pause dur="short"/> although to be fair we are just introducing ourselves yeah <pause dur="short"/> so I haven't met you yet <pause dur="short"/> you used to know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="113" who="S0058">mm yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> cos maybe they they're not just randomers they are I think they were sort of semi I think they were semi-local sort of friends who had bought it from them</u>
<u n="115" who="S0058">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0179">erm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0058">so if you yeah so if you say I know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that will help <pause dur="short"/> ha</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="118" who="S0058">but yeah what do you think? I think that could be quite nice <pause dur="short"/> and I think kind of having thought about it I think it might be nice to do something a bit different</u>
<u n="119" who="S0179">what was the <anon type="place"/> idea?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0058">there is the <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0179" trans="overlap">I mean we could check that out</u>
<u n="122" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> if we maybe look into that and just <pause dur="short"/> get some idea of prices maybe and and that kind of thing <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="123" who="S0179">but not as relaxing</u>
<u n="124" who="S0058">but yeah <pause dur="short"/> because of the travelling and new place and I'd <trunc>cer</trunc> for one would certainly be like I had to see things</u>
<u n="125" who="S0179">wow <pause dur="short"/> that's what you get for easing off early</u>
<u n="126" who="S0058">yeah nice</u>
<u n="127" who="S0179">perfect</u>
<u n="128" who="S0058"><pause dur="long"/></u>

<u n="131" who="S0179">yeah didn't have to stop</u>
<u n="132" who="S0058">you're in the peak of efficiency tonight</u>
<u n="133" who="S0179">I'm trying</u>
<u n="134" who="S0058">ha ha</u>
<u n="135" who="S0179">you see it's quite fun as an exercise</u>
<u n="136" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0179">what can you eek out?</u>
<u n="138" who="S0058">hmm mm sounds wrong</u>

<u n="145" who="S0179">what we should do on Sunday <pause dur="short"/> oh sorry on Friday night is go to a college bar</u>
<u n="146" who="S0058">interesting yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0179">Deluxe</u>
<u n="148" who="S0058">actually yeah er we should talk about that tonight cos me and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> need to know what we're gonna do cos we sort of said we might stay in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="149" who="S0179">I'm not working out tomorrow</u>
<u n="150" who="S0058">no <pause dur="short"/> no no <pause dur="short"/> ha <pause dur="short"/> erm I mean just whether we're gonna go out in <anon type="place"/> or not <pause dur="short"/> erm as in shall we stay in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="151" who="S0179">er yeah <trunc>if</trunc> I would</u>
<u n="152" who="S0058">um oh yeah I mean if if we're going out in <anon type="place"/> we'll stay in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> it's pointless coming back unless there's a particular reason to <pause dur="short"/> we were thinking erm yeah sort of do something in the gym after work and then meet you afterwards</u>
<u n="153" who="S0179">alright</u>
<u n="154" who="S0058">um if that would be as the same as normal?</u>
<u n="155" who="S0179">yeah that sounds great yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0058">cool</u>
<u n="157" who="S0179">so I'm easing off now</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="158" who="S0179">so a little bit more acceleration now <pause dur="short"/> there's fairly good visibility <pause dur="short"/> I'll stay in third <pause dur="short"/> I might <trunc>hav</trunc> I barely have to slow down specifically</u>
<u n="159" who="S0058">nice</u>
<u n="160" who="S0179">that is forward planning</u>
<u n="161" who="S0058">ha ha that was incredible</u>
<u n="162" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I haven't actually had to stop once since entering <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="163" who="S0058" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> sweet</u>
<u n="164" who="S0179">well I bet they're working</u>

<u n="166" who="S0179">the lights</u>
<u n="167" who="S0058">yes they are I know <pause dur="short"/> ha ha impressive</u>
<u n="168" who="S0179">just easing off here <pause dur="short"/> just take second <pause dur="short"/> I need a bit more flexibility <pause dur="short"/> it's not that bad there</u>
<u n="169" who="S0058">oh er in in there's a fair queue down there <pause dur="short"/> people sort of pulled over to the pavement there</u>
<u n="170" who="S0179">only two cars</u>
<u n="171" who="S0058" trans="overlap">two cars <pause dur="short"/> er yeah it's not as bad I mean <pause dur="short"/> I think you're right I think maybe <anon type="place"/> is car heavy and people heavy for one petrol station</u>
<u n="172" who="S0179" trans="overlap">yeah exactly <pause dur="short"/> there's huge er tons of people come back from work finish dinner</u>
<u n="173" who="S0058">yeah</u>

<u n="175" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0179">ironically sitting up with your engine idle in that queue you'd probably be more cost effective to drive to</u>
<u n="177" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0179">well maybe not by the time you've driven there but</u>
<u n="179" who="S0058">well <pause dur="short"/> if you can think of any other reason to go near another petrol station <pause dur="short"/> ah a little John Lewis van</u>
<u n="180" who="S0179">it's quite a big lorry actually</u>
<u n="181" who="S0058">no it looks smaller than some of them though <pause dur="short"/> there's some huge ones</u>
<u n="182" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> articulated lorries</u>
<u n="183" who="S0058">yes <pause dur="short"/> okay so a big lorry <pause dur="short"/> fine <pause dur="short"/> ha</u>

<u n="186" who="S0179">um no</u>
<u n="187" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="191" who="S0058">hmm mm</u>

<u n="194" who="S0179">or we could</u>
<u n="195" who="S0058">I was thinking <anon type="place"/> might be a bit weird</u>
<u n="196" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="197" who="S0058">um <pause dur="short"/> I mean <anon type="place"/> is a nice option</u>

<u n="244" who="S0058">ha <pause dur="short"/> fair enough <pause dur="short"/> good way of looking at it</u>
<u n="245" who="S0179">there's a very wide unnecessarily wide bike lane</u>
<u n="246" who="S0058">yeah stupidly wide</u>
<u n="247" who="S0179">it's almost a bus lane</u>

<u n="259" who="S0179">it's a weird college</u>
<u n="260" who="S0058">it is strange yeah</u>
<u n="261" who="S0179">it's just strange that you can do subjects here you can't do anywhere else <pause dur="short"/> cos I thought that when I applied I was told you can do every subject at every college</u>
<u n="262" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I think you can but Education and Drama are kind of solely based at <anon type="place"/> and you would have to be supervised there</u>
<u n="263" who="S0179">are they taught there?</u>
<u n="264" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>do</trunc> well the the Education does well I think Drama you would be in the English faculty for some of it</u>
<u n="265" who="S0179" trans="overlap"></u>
<u n="266" who="S0058">but I think some of the solely Drama lectures are probably</u>
<u n="267" who="S0179">and this is a degree from the University of <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="268" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="269" who="S0179">shite</u>
<u n="270" who="S0058">well no I mean like so Education I think you have to do with a subject obviously <pause dur="short"/> and so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> did Maths for half of her time and Education for half of her time</u>
<u n="271" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="272" who="S0058">er I don't know if you can do just solely Education <pause dur="short"/> you might be able to</u>
<u n="273" who="S0179">no I meant the Education and Drama</u>
<u n="274" who="S0058">oh right well it's not the same degree <pause dur="short"/> as far as I know <pause dur="short"/> unless you could <pause dur="short"/> you possibly could come out with one but</u>
<u n="275" who="S0179">what do you mean it's not the same degree?</u>
<u n="276" who="S0058">education and Drama <pause dur="short"/> I meant you can do education comma drama</u>
<u n="277" who="S0179">oh Drama is not a degree is it? Can't get a degree in Drama</u>
<u n="278" who="S0058">you can do English and Drama as a joint</u>
<u n="279" who="S0179">yeah but you can't just do a degree in Drama</u>
<u n="280" who="S0058">I don't know I you think you <pause dur="short"/> well I'm not sure because there definitely is the I did I was supervised because I did Shakespeare in Performance and I was a supervised with Drama students</u>
<u n="281" who="S0179">now I'm focusing on looking for car parking</u>

<u n="283" who="S0179">with Drama students</u>
<u n="284" who="S0058">yeah and so they hadn't done the er the first two years of English <pause dur="short"/> so I presumed they must have been doing Drama <pause dur="short"/> erm hospital just says to the right <pause dur="short"/> yeah car park <pause dur="short"/> empty</u>
<u n="285" who="S0179">so we need to figure out how to get into it</u>
<u n="286" who="S0058">erm <pause dur="short"/> I assume you just go round into the hospital entrance and then there'll be a <pause dur="short"/> it looks like you just go right up that driveway and then you could come in at the top of it</u>
<u n="287" who="S0179">okey dokey</u>
