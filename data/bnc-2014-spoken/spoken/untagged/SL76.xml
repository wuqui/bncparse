<u n="3" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="4" who="S0058">so</u>

<u n="6" who="S0058">mm yeah fair enough <pause dur="short"/> but yeah it's erm it's got a large feel to it <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> it's quite nice in a way but it's also slightly odd</u>
<u n="7" who="S0179"><unclear/> to it</u>
<u n="8" who="S0058">erm oh tunes <pause dur="short"/> and it's just the feel of the main <anon type="place"/> is is my dad's right it's slightly odd it's not nowhere near as nice as <anon type="place"/> so it's like erm <pause dur="short"/> sorry <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="9" who="S0179">you need to keep your head back for this bit here?</u>

<u n="15" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0058">or what you've done before <unclear/></u>
<u n="17" who="S0179">I'll be very smart</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="18" who="S0179">okay</u>
<u n="19" who="S0058">okay</u>
<u n="20" who="S0058">yeah like I said erm so <anon type="place"/> is a very modern style of doing parks as as <unclear/> like it's it's all sort of done to look slightly natural but with plastic in it <pause dur="short"/> easy accessible nature whereas <anon type="place"/> is very much a Victorian don't you think? <trunc>V</trunc> very Victorian style of park</u>
<u n="21" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="22" who="S0058">sort of little walks and little hills and a little pond and it's it's it's yeah definitely <pause dur="short"/> oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="23" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="24" who="S0058">erm okay so yeah <pause dur="short"/> thank you very much for bringing me I think it's been a really good visit</u>
<u n="25" who="S0179">yeah I like that <unclear/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0058">yeah well I I think my parents have been the ones that's made the difference today ironically of course</u>
<u n="27" who="S0179"><anon type="place"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="28" who="S0058">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> I didn't realise quite how stressed about everything</u>
<u n="29" who="S0179">yeah I've become quite used to all of this</u>
<u n="30" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm sort of used I think they're maybe more well I think they think I'll be more bothered by the fact he's a bit confused but just from the you know the</u>
<u n="31" who="S0179">well it's a not bad confused</u>
<u n="32" who="S0058">exactly yeah <trunc>a</trunc> and I think he's doing quite well and if if he asks me the same question twice I just answer it twice it's not  it's not  a big deal</u>
<u n="33" who="S0179">yeah less than five times is good</u>
<u n="34" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah erm I mean my gran said as well that he was pleased to see us so like I said if you sort of if that's one thing in his head that's a good thing and it's in his head is a a really nice good thing and he's reminded of it then that's that's fine <pause dur="short"/> but yeah I think er</u>
<u n="35" who="S0179">because if he used to know cars <unclear/></u>
<u n="36" who="S0058">yeah the band can go in it yeah <pause dur="short"/> if the balloon goes in that odd thing because it's the the back windows are blacked out it can go in there</u>
<u n="37" who="S0179">well no <unclear/> any car</u>
<u n="38" who="S0058">oh yeah yeah fair enough</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="39" who="S0058">but yeah erm thanks for doing the driving <unclear/> I think it's been really worth coming even though we didn't see him very much</u>
<u n="40" who="S0179">well I think it's er the gesture's important</u>
<u n="41" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<event desc="sound of music"/>
<u n="42" who="S0058">you can see up on the side there where all the cars have gone up on the edge to get around into that lane</u>
<u n="43" who="S0179">superb</u>
<u n="44" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<event desc="sound of music"/>
<u n="45" who="S0179"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="46" who="S0058">it's funny in there isn't it?</u>
<event desc="sound of music"/>
<u n="47" who="S0179">that really annoys me</u>
<u n="48" who="S0058">what?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0179">we all pay road tax</u>
<u n="50" who="S0058">oh right yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it's stupid I mean</u>
<u n="51" who="S0179">it doesn't help the car traffic flow at all and I'd just like to know what other vehicles</u>
<event desc="sound of music"/>
<u n="52" who="S0058">I mean sort of bus names yes <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure yes I mean</u>
<u n="53" who="S0179">possibly but I think it's literally just taxis <unclear/></u>
<u n="54" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0179">I think that's slightly offensive</u>
<u n="56" who="S0058">well because yeah if you own a taxi</u>
<u n="57" who="S0179">and it's a car</u>
<u n="58" who="S0058">that's yeah <pause dur="short"/> you can use it as a car though</u>
<event desc="sound of music"/>
<u n="59" who="S0179">oh I see what you mean</u>
<u n="60" who="S0058">so you could just be driving in your taxi so like erm you know I've I've got  I've got  friends whose dads are taxi drivers and you know driving us about in them and you know that's a taxi <pause dur="short"/> I was going</u>
<u n="61" who="S0179">the <unclear/> hill's over there</u>
<u n="62" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I always feel like there's like I've forgotten something <pause dur="short"/> probably not</u>
<u n="63" who="S0179"><unclear/> my glasses</u>
<u n="64" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="66" who="S0058">yes <pause dur="short"/> I've got <unclear/></u>
<u n="67" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0058">shit I've forgotten my house keys</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="69" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's handy having my old house keys on as well it's just you don't need to remember to bring anything different when you're</u>
<u n="70" who="S0179">how you can <unclear/></u>
<u n="71" who="S0058" trans="overlap">I've I've still got them on the same key ring yeah <pause dur="short"/> well cos they were on originally and I just put the new ones on but actually it's it's quite handy having them</u>
<u n="72" who="S0179">oh you see I've got a whole set on my keying <unclear/> in my pocket</u>
<u n="73" who="S0058">yeah I'd say I don't have them in sort of trouser pockets so it's not so bad <pause dur="short"/> oh actually <unclear/> car just went past then</u>
<u n="74" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="75" who="S0058">yeah it was silver but it was covered up with duct tape</u>
<u n="76" who="S0179">oh right</u>
<u n="77" who="S0058">so it kind of completed the colour but it looks sort of wiggly and wrong</u>
<u n="78" who="S0179"><unclear/> duct tape</u>
<u n="79" who="S0058">mm yeah</u>
<event desc="sound of music"/>
<u n="80" who="S0058">I got a text from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> this morning apologising for the texts</u>
<u n="81" who="S0179">yeah apologise and those were the texts we wanted to see <pause dur="short"/> did he do anything?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="83" who="S0179">of course not <pause dur="short"/> it's a good opportunity</u>
<u n="84" who="S0058">well it was</u>
<u n="85" who="S0179">and you shouldn't go out with someone in your team</u>
<u n="86" who="S0058">no well</u>
<u n="87" who="S0179">that's just leads to <unclear/> saying you shouldn't but not casually anyway that could lead to all sorts of problems</u>
<u n="88" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think erm yeah er yeah he said what to do and I said well ask her to dance so I think it was the ceilidh erm I said ask her to dance and he said he did but it wasn't taken in a romantic way <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="89" who="S0179">how does he know?</u>
<u n="90" who="S0058">presumably yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0179">ooh hang on</u>
<u n="92" who="S0058">oh yes <trunc>so</trunc> sorry I should have er</u>
<u n="93" who="S0179">no it was just instinct <unclear/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0058" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0179">force of habit</u>
<u n="96" who="S0058">oh a coach for London</u>
<u n="97" who="S0179">cool <pause dur="short"/> I bet that takes a while</u>
<u n="98" who="S0058">I'm sure I've looked into this because I was looking for you know when I was sort of coming down to see you a lot?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0058">and it's not that cheap to get from <anon type="place"/> to <anon type="place"/> and I was looking for sort of cheaper ways of doing it erm and I looked into coaches <pause dur="short"/> but the problem was it was something like eight and a half hours but that's cos it stopped for three hours in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="101" who="S0179">well we could have come and got you from <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and it wasn't that cheap actually <pause dur="short"/> if you book it a long way in advance it is a lot cheaper but if you're booking it erm sort of you know at at the you know kind of very short notice it wasn't that much cheaper than the train <pause dur="short"/> and I thought well it's easier for everyone and I may as well pay the extra ten quid you know it really wasn't any cheaper</u>
<u n="103" who="S0179">yeah well it'd cost <unclear/> anyway</u>
<u n="104" who="S0058">exactly that's what I thought <pause dur="short"/> erm whereas if you book it a long time in advance then yeah it would have been cheaper but I thought it would save the effort you know? Well in other words <unclear/></u>
<u n="105" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="106" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0179">what were you saying?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0058">erm yeah one of the nicest ways to do it is to get the Sunderland to London train so that's a really nice train <pause dur="short"/> erm it's quite fast as well</u>
<u n="109" who="S0179">and then come out again?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0058">and then come out of London yeah <pause dur="short"/> but and that has the advantage that it's a fixed price so if you're booking in advance don't do that because it's quite expensive <pause dur="short"/> if you've booking on the day you can literally get on the train and buy a ticket on the train and it's not horrendous <trunc>bec</trunc> you know because we did that one time and we got we bought out tickets on the day and it was horrendously expensive</u>
<u n="111" who="S0179">who's we?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0058">Us two <pause dur="short"/> we erm we were coming down from</u>
<u n="113" who="S0179">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0058">what what was the situation? We we were getting a?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0179">Holiday</u>
<u n="116" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0179">which is <unclear/> we had to go back to get the other car</u>
<u n="118" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh right yeah we had to go down yeah</u>
<event desc="sound of music"/>
<u n="119" who="S0058">and that was ridiculously expensive getting them on the day but yeah so this particular Sunderland train you can get on the train and buy it on the train which is also a key to sort of urgently <pause dur="short"/> but it's still gonna be like sixty quid which is really good and it may be more than that now but yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0179">of course what we could have done on that day is go through to Sunderland and get the train</u>
<u n="121" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0179">but then of course you actually wanted to get off at <anon type="place"/> </u>
<u n="123" who="S0058">I was gonna say that that doesn't stop after York so it would have been sort of Newcastle Sunderland Sunderland to London London to <unclear/> which would have been a pain</u>
<u n="124" who="S0179">I see</u>
<u n="125" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I miss the sea</u>
<u n="126" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="127" who="S0058"><unclear/> We'll get to see it next time we'll do this <pause dur="short"/> next time we'll do that</u>
<u n="128" who="S0179">what like yesterday you mean?</u>
<u n="129" who="S0058">well no it's just sort of today we've been saying you know erm I'll have to go to <anon type="place"/> next time and we'll have to what was it? It was something else we said as well <pause dur="short"/> yeah we'll have to go down to the seafront next time</u>
<event desc="sound of music"/>
<u n="130" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="131" who="S0058">mm</u>
<event desc="sound of music"/>
<u n="132" who="S0058">yeah erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> sounded really pleased that we were going I think he's looking forward to seeing us which is nice <pause dur="short"/> maybe he feels a bit out on a limb</u>
<u n="133" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0058">and of course he doesn't have any money so travelling up around <unclear/></u>
<u n="135" who="S0179" trans="overlap">is his job paid well?</u>
<u n="136" who="S0058">he's paid I think it is a job but erm I feel very certain it's not paying him an awful lot</u>
<u n="137" who="S0179">well no it's almost a certainty</u>
<u n="138" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well he's probably minimum wage but having said that I don't know if he's paying very he won't be paying very much rent or you know that kind of thing <pause dur="short"/> he he might be <trunc>con</trunc> contributing because it's his family <pause dur="short"/> it's it's not like he's gonna be paying commercial rent so it's not going be quite as bad as <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was</u>
<u n="139" who="S0179">no <pause dur="short"/> who seems to be doing okay in her new situation</u>
<u n="140" who="S0058">yeah well she's actually staying at erm <unclear/> and she was saying when she was you know when she was looking for jobs the first time around straight out of uni?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0179"><unclear/> initially worked out very badly</u>
<u n="142" who="S0058">yeah it wasn't really</u>
<u n="143" who="S0179">I don't know if you realised that?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no I did because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was also talking to Simon on the <pause dur="short"/> simon <pause dur="short"/> no I realised that</u>
<u n="145" who="S0179" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="146" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0179">erm I did actually end up just getting into that conversation</u>
<u n="148" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0179">erm but <unclear/></u>
<u n="150" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0179">er and you <unclear/> to me</u>
<u n="152" who="S0058">well I'd gone out and I I'd been moved down one I think</u>
<u n="153" who="S0179">yes but for whatever reason</u>
<u n="154" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="156" who="S0058">yeah sorry it didn't work out necessarily very well for you</u>
<u n="157" who="S0179">no you just didn't spend <unclear/></u>
<u n="158" who="S0058">sorry <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0179">it <unclear/> initially</u>
<u n="160" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="162" who="S0058">erm what was I going to say? Yes erm so I thought <pause dur="short"/> so anyway she was saying when when she was first applying for jobs and there was one erm in Hull which she went for the interview and everything and she the feedback was basically we'd really really like you but and we'd love to give you the job but unfortunately you just don't have any experience <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0179">what?</u>
<u n="164" who="S0058">but <pause dur="short"/> well exactly</u>
<u n="165" who="S0179"><unclear/> give me something</u>
<u n="166" who="S0058">well apparently there was somebody else they realised who had experience and it wasn't that they didn't like her it was just you know couldn't just <unclear/> with her <pause dur="short"/> but and so anyway but she's this job</u>
<u n="167" who="S0179">this is in Hull?</u>
<u n="168" who="S0058">has come up <pause dur="short"/> in Hull yeah <pause dur="short"/> but this job has come up again and erm she rang the woman and who'd you know had given her this feedback and said right <pause dur="short"/> so if I apply for this job I've now got a year and whatever how many months of experience in this industry</u>
<u n="169" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0058">what are my chances? And the woman said well I'm actually leaving before the interviews happen but I will be erm passing on my er my recommendation and my kind of my my thoughts to all <trunc>do</trunc> doing the interviews <pause dur="short"/> erm you know and just say that I think you'd be an excellent choice</u>
<u n="171" who="S0179">that's cool</u>
<u n="172" who="S0058">well it is cool</u>
<u n="173" who="S0179">so obviously not <unclear/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0058">yeah they've taken the top off <pause dur="short"/> that's really good</u>
<u n="175" who="S0179" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="176" who="S0058">yeah <unclear/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> sort of windmill <trunc>s</trunc> shape as well <pause dur="short"/> that's really cool</u>
<u n="177" who="S0179">so anyway so this <unclear/></u>
<u n="178" who="S0058" trans="overlap">so anyway yeah <pause dur="short"/> so I think she yeah erm I mean I didn't know how keen she was in this one at Basingstoke which presumably she's more keen on the one in Hull</u>
<u n="179" who="S0179">well what is her job?</u>
<u n="180" who="S0058">I think it's very similar but probably slightly better paid erm</u>
<u n="181" who="S0179">so so yeah so</u>
<u n="182" who="S0058">so so I think it's marketing yeah <pause dur="short"/> so a similar sort of thing I think just promotions erm and that sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> I'm really pleased that she's managed to make inroads into it because it could have been a bit of nightmare</u>
<u n="183" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0058">but she's yeah I think a lot of people like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> as well seems to be making inroads into theatre which is impossible so I think he's doing really well</u>
<u n="185" who="S0179"><unclear/> starting places?</u>
<u n="186" who="S0058">yeah</u>
