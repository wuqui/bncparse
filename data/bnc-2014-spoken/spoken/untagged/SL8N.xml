<u n="515" who="S0012" trans="overlap">no no no you have to prove you haven't you a television well they got maybe you have</u>
<u n="516" who="S0008">they just assume that you've got a television and you got to prove you haven't</u>
<u n="517" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="518" who="S0012"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he's being paying his television licence although he hasn't got a television</u>
<u n="519" who="S0013">cos it erm it's because it was on the standing charge</u>
<u n="520" who="S0012">on a standing charge and he kept paying his television licence</u>
<u n="521" who="S0013">he hasn't yet he got in touch with them he hadn't had a television for a long time</u>
<u n="522" who="S0012">and now he can get all his money back <trunc>re</trunc><trunc>ret</trunc>retrospectfully</u>
<u n="523" who="S0013">apparently yeah</u>

<u n="531" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah oh er it isn't over a year anyway is it?</u>
<u n="532" who="S0008">but I reckon the <trunc>re</trunc> er you know and I'm now in a case where the the <anon type="place"/> enforcement officer is going to call round at any time day or night and check whether I've got a television</u>
<u n="533" who="S0012">and are they can they break in if you're?</u>
<u n="534" who="S0008">no no no no no they can't come in at all they can only come in if you invite them in</u>
<u n="535" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="536" who="S0008">if you stand on the doorstep and you don't have to answer any questions either</u>
<u n="537" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="538" who="S0008">and er if they think you've got a telly they can go away and get a <trunc>c</trunc> a a search warrant</u>
<u n="539" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="540" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="541" who="S0008">and then they come back with the police right and then they can search your house and can check your your computer and all this sort of stuff</u>
<u n="542" who="S0012">oh course you can watch watch telly on the computer can't you?</u>
<u n="543" who="S0008">well you need a TV card don't you?</u>
<u n="544" who="S0012">you do yeah</u>
<u n="545" who="S0008">mostly so they can see if there's one of them stuck in the back</u>
<u n="546" who="S0012">oh yeah course</u>
<u n="547" who="S0008">and er although they do live streaming as well don't they?</u>
<u n="548" who="S0012">yeah they do yeah</u>
<u n="549" who="S0008">I'm not hundred percent sure that that counts because the the TV licence wording says that you're not allowed to watch anything on your computer which is <trunc>sh</trunc> been showing live on TV right?</u>
<u n="550" who="S0012">oh I see</u>
<u n="551" who="S0008">and like the streaming isn't on the TV</u>
<u n="552" who="S0012">no it isn't</u>
<u n="553" who="S0008">this is the other thing I was thinking if I bought myself a a video pass for motor GP</u>
<u n="554" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="555" who="S0008">which is streamed live you know without going through the television at all</u>
<u n="556" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0008">and no one else can you can't see it on television you can only see it streamed</u>
<u n="558" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="559" who="S0008">you know whether that counts I don't know it's live so I don't bother there's nothing on I mean it <trunc>a</trunc> yeah there is absolutely nothing I want to watch really</u>
<u n="560" who="S0012">there isn't no</u>
<u n="561" who="S0013">no</u>
<u n="562" who="S0008">even if I miss something you know I I don't particular I'm not that interested in it</u>

<u n="564" who="S0008">watching it later</u>
<u n="565" who="S0012">no no we're not what what we do watch first thing in the morning is some of the bits that we've er recorded</u>
<u n="566" who="S0013">yeah there was some good stuff this morning weren't there?</u>
<u n="567" who="S0012">I can't remember what we watched this morning</u>
<u n="568" who="S0013">erm The Food We Eat</u>
<u n="569" who="S0012">oh The Food We Eat yeah</u>
<u n="570" who="S0013">oh how blueberries are a a super food</u>
<u n="571" who="S0012">all about super foods</u>
<u n="572" who="S0008">oh right</u>
<u n="573" who="S0013">and</u>
<u n="574" who="S0012">and</u>
<u n="575" who="S0013"><unclear>what was it?</unclear></u>
<u n="576" who="S0012">and how they got this er getting rid of of what was it called? er getting rid of the the</u>
<u n="577" who="S0013">antioxidants?</u>
<u n="578" who="S0012">antioxidant the yeah</u>
<u n="579" who="S0008" trans="overlap">oxidants</u>
<u n="580" who="S0012">the yeah and radical digerydoos</u>
<u n="581" who="S0008">radicals <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="582" who="S0012">yeah radicals</u>
<u n="583" who="S0008">toxic radicals</u>
<u n="584" who="S0013" trans="overlap">give you cancer and things yeah</u>
<u n="585" who="S0012">that's it yeah and a very good to er get rid of any cancer type cells</u>
<u n="586" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="587" who="S0013">what did they have? they had broccoli</u>
<u n="588" who="S0008">yeah broccoli is</u>
<u n="589" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="590" who="S0008">is brilliant for</u>
<u n="591" who="S0013">green tea</u>
<u n="592" who="S0012">green tea yeah</u>
<u n="593" who="S0013">what's that spice?</u>
<u n="594" who="S0012">blueberries</u>
<u n="595" who="S0013">that spice turmeric?</u>
<u n="596" who="S0012">turmeric</u>
<u n="597" who="S0013">and something else</u>
<u n="598" who="S0012">and they got this tablet now that they've now formulated</u>
<u n="599" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="600" who="S0012">because all these different thing this is Cancer Research all these different thing attacks the cancer in a different way</u>
<u n="601" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="602" who="S0012">and they're all naturally naturally produced if I mean er in lots of countries where they've proven that they eat all this type of thing there's hardly any cancer</u>
<u n="603" who="S0008">far fewer cancers mm</u>
<u n="604" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="605" who="S0008">whereas in this country you've got one in two chance of catching getting cancer in your lifetime don't you?</u>
<u n="606" who="S0012" trans="overlap">well that's right yeah in your whole lifetime</u>
<u n="607" who="S0008">yeah I mean that's pretty pretty short odds innit?</u>
<u n="608" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah that is</u>
<u n="609" who="S0013">isn't it?</u>
<u n="610" who="S0012">anyhow that's that's they got this er tablet formulated but they said you needn't have the tablet all you need to do is eat the eat the food well that's that's what come out of it altogether</u>
<u n="611" who="S0013" trans="overlap">that was basically yeah</u>
<u n="612" who="S0012">basically they say if you if you eat eat your <pause dur="short"/> proper food instead of all this</u>
<u n="613" who="S0008">processed</u>
<u n="614" who="S0012">processed stuff</u>
<u n="615" who="S0013">I can't really remember what the blueberry <vocal desc="laugh"/> result was because they people were saying they're some were saying they're stressed some said they were tired all the time erm</u>
<u n="616" who="S0012" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah well the</u>
<u n="617" who="S0013">they did it on various different people didn't they?</u>
<u n="618" who="S0012">they did yeah and they all come out they were the best one was ninety percent better <pause dur="short"/> you know had ninety percent</u>
<u n="619" who="S0008">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> improvement</u>
<u n="620" who="S0012">improvement and the worst one was sixty percent improvement <pause dur="short"/> but they all improved so well that they all felt better</u>
<u n="621" who="S0013" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> but it could have been just through</u>
<u n="622" who="S0008" trans="overlap">that's until they find the next wonder food <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="623" who="S0012">well yeah yeah well that was just that experiment</u>
<u n="624" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="625" who="S0012">well the things they did were always good</u>
<u n="626" who="S0008" trans="overlap"><unclear/> with er broccoli and blueberries that's <pause dur="short"/> sort of fairly well documented</u>
<u n="627" who="S0012">anyway</u>
<u n="628" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yes they are yeah</u>
<u n="629" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="630" who="S0008">cos I mean er as as I</u>
<u n="631" who="S0012">well it's not just broccoli it's all green food</u>
<u n="632" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="633" who="S0012">all green food have got these these er</u>
<u n="634" who="S0008">whatever they are</u>
<u n="635" who="S0012">radical <trunc>c</trunc> whatever they are</u>
<u n="636" who="S0013" trans="overlap">oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="637" who="S0008">this conversation's a bit like I've been listening to this series <pause dur="short"/> called erm <pause dur="short"/> understanding the Cosmos or something</u>
<u n="638" who="S0013">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="639" who="S0008">and that's on radio four extra and it was at quarter to <trunc>quar</trunc> no quarter past two or something and it was just fifteen minutes and there was this woman scientist she was going through <pause dur="short"/> astronomy <pause dur="short"/> you know right from the early stages and the different eras when different things were discovered about the solar system and the galaxy and stuff like that</u>
<u n="640" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="641" who="S0008">and then I mean this was in about thirty-four parts right and er I sort of picked up on one or two of them and they're so interesting they really are</u>
<u n="642" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="643" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="644" who="S0008">and <pause dur="short"/> then she's sort of getting on to this thing about er <pause dur="short"/> you know quite a recent discoveries and like all the major discoveries have been done in a sort of the last fifty years and every sort of five years they have some other major <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="645" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> like a star blow up or something</u>
<u n="646" who="S0008" trans="overlap">well no no no a major idea because all the ideas sort of like this sort of things that don't quite work unless someone go away and thinks about it for five years and someone would come out and explain why that</u>
<u n="647" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> didn't work</u>
<u n="648" who="S0008">actually didn't yeah that doesn't and er they were sort of talking about <pause dur="short"/> how you know the origins of the universe</u>
<u n="649" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="650" who="S0008">and what happened and you know how how galaxies are made and how stars are made in galaxies and then what happens with stars you know when they sort of the life story of a star and why some stars do one thing and some stars do another thing and then what happens after that you know and what black holes are and how black holes occur</u>
<u n="651" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="652" who="S0008">and then they were talking about dark matter and all these sort of things you've heard of but you've got no idea what they are</u>
<u n="653" who="S0012">no that's right yeah</u>
<u n="654" who="S0008">and the <trunc>co</trunc> she explained it so well</u>
<u n="655" who="S0012">did she yeah?</u>
<u n="656" who="S0008">that you could listen to fifteen minutes of her talking and think oh that was so interesting</u>
<u n="657" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="658" who="S0008">and then you start telling someone about it and as soon as you try and describe it you've forgotten it</u>
<u n="659" who="S0012">that's it yeah</u>
<u n="660" who="S0008">you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="661" who="S0013">yeah it's a shame</u>
<u n="662" who="S0008">you knew you understood it for fifteen minutes</u>
<u n="663" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="664" who="S0013">but it's it's translating it again isn't it?</u>
<u n="665" who="S0008">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="666" who="S0012">they they have a programme with Dara O'Briain and that er</u>
<u n="667" who="S0008">oh that mathematics thing</u>
<u n="668" who="S0013" trans="overlap">Brian Cox</u>
<u n="669" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>I</trunc> well I not just that Brian Cox and Dara O'Briain they're both you know their heads are just just just elsewhere they're so fantastically brilliant</u>
<u n="670" who="S0013">yeah Star Gazing or something?</u>
<u n="671" who="S0012">and when Star Gazing it was called that's right it's a programme one the television that that is called Star Gazing and they show you all the different constellations and everything where to look at how to find them and and you know what sort of gear you need to see the stuff really really good that it it's really interesting and er they just blind you with science</u>
<u n="672" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="673" who="S0012">because they know so much I mean but they do <trunc>te</trunc> that is explained really really well and you think oh yeah oh right and then when that's finished you go what did he say? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="674" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="675" who="S0012">I mean that was all about <trunc>bla</trunc>black holes forming and er white stars and black stars</u>
<u n="676" who="S0008">dark stars yeah</u>
<u n="677" who="S0012">black dark stars</u>
<u n="678" who="S0008">this is what they er a bit about the life and death of the star right there was a a basically a star is just helium right?</u>
<u n="679" who="S0012">that's it yeah</u>
<u n="680" who="S0008">and helium burns and forms hydrogen or some process goes through it</u>
<u n="681" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="682" who="S0008">so all you got in the universe basically is helium and hydrogen that's all you've got to start with</u>
<u n="683" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="684" who="S0008">and then these stars keep going until all the helium is used up and then what happens is the hydrogen then stars reacting with something else</u>
<u n="685" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="686" who="S0008">and using itself up and forming carbon and iron right? and then all of the all of this sort of cos this <trunc>gu</trunc> this star's basically a huge gaseous <trunc>mas</trunc></u>
<u n="687" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="688" who="S0008">massive you know amount of matter in it</u>
<u n="689" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="690" who="S0008">and but it starts receding and receding and receding and all this whatever hydrogen stuff and it's all converted into carbon and iron and stuff and then that gets blown off and then you end up with just a metal core</u>
<u n="691" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="692" who="S0008">right an iron core and that's a dark star right and then they were saying that some stars are so massive right? that this iron core is basically unstable right? and it collapses in on itself under its <trunc>gr</trunc> own gravity</u>
<u n="693" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="694" who="S0008">and then it forms these</u>
<u n="695" who="S0012">it's so dense</u>
<u n="696" who="S0008">it forms these er er sort of nuclear nuclear sort of er well it's like an explosion right</u>
<u n="697" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="698" who="S0008">and these things explode in this phenomenal supernova right?</u>
<u n="699" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="700" who="S0008">and during that process all the other elements in the universe are formed like gold nickel copper</u>
<u n="701" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="702" who="S0013">ah</u>
<u n="703" who="S0008">cos like when you think about like any element is basically a nucleus with electrons going round it</u>
<u n="704" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah that's right yeah</u>
<u n="705" who="S0008">and whatever you know and it depends on how many electrons it's got to what metal it is</u>
<u n="706" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="707" who="S0008">or what what substance is it right? well I suppose they're all metals to start with aren't they?</u>
<u n="708" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="709" who="S0008">and er of course during the course of this massive nuclear reaction during this supernova like all these all this hydrogen is converted to all these other things or the or the iron is converted to all these other elements and then they just get sprayed out all over the universe</u>
<u n="710" who="S0012">that's god sneezing</u>
<u n="711" who="S0008">right?</u>
<u n="712" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="713" who="S0008">and and they were saying that every bit of gold you know that you own like a gold ring was once part of a supernova</u>
<u n="714" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah oh wow yeah</u>
<u n="715" who="S0008">you know billions of years ago somewhere in space</u>
<u n="716" who="S0012">wow</u>
<u n="717" who="S0008">makes you think doesn't it?</u>
<u n="718" who="S0012">it does make you think yeah yeah course gold is the only metal</u>
<u n="719" who="S0013">but they mine it out the ground don't they?</u>
<u n="720" who="S0008">yeah but that's only cos it's come together on the planet you see see planets are different from stars</u>
<u n="721" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="722" who="S0008">they're formed by there's all this dust flying around in nebula right where you hear about like the horse head nebula</u>
<u n="723" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="724" who="S0008">they do this thing you know they go on erm Hubble photographs or something like that</u>
<u n="725" who="S0012">yeah that's brilliant isn't it?</u>
<u n="726" who="S0008">fantastic photographs of these nebula and stuff</u>
<u n="727" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="728" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="729" who="S0008">and like that Milky Way is a nebula as well</u>
<u n="730" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="731" who="S0008">and it's basically just a load of infinitely small parts of dust and all sort of stuff just drifting around and it gets in this sort of gravitational field and slowly you get it coalescing right?</u>
<u n="732" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="733" who="S0008">and as it coalesces it build up its centre of gravity more and more which means it drags other stuff into it and and eventually it becomes a planet you know with just made out of dust in space and the bigger it gets the more it starts pulling it in</u>
<u n="734" who="S0012">yeah no they they were</u>
<u n="735" who="S0008">I mean that's I mean you know I'm probably talking a load of bollocks but that is basically</u>
<u n="736" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah what it's all about</u>
<u n="737" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="738" who="S0008">sort of like the</u>
<u n="739" who="S0013">you remembered that quite well</u>
<u n="740" who="S0008">the the idea of what happens you know</u>
<u n="741" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="742" who="S0008">and there's other forces involved as well obviously and then you see you get a black holes are basically you know if you if you get one atom of what helium or something like that you got a nucleus there</u>
<u n="743" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="744" who="S0008">and then an electron</u>
<u n="745" who="S0012">going round it</u>
<u n="746" who="S0008">going round with that that much space between and what happens if that electron goes</u>
<u n="747" who="S0012">crashing in yeah</u>
<u n="748" who="S0008">into the nuclei? you get this incredibly dense</u>
<u n="749" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="750" who="S0008">you know you you can sort of compress everything to an incredibly dense object that's got it's so dense and so small but it's got a huge gravitational force</u>
<u n="751" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="752" who="S0008">and of course it then sucks all this other stuff in because it's got such a high gravitational force</u>
<u n="753" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="754" who="S0008">and it sort of all all the stuff collapses into this really really really dense centre which makes an even <trunc>high</trunc> greater force you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="755" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="756" who="S0008">and it's sucking stuff in all the time and you know and becoming more and more powerful</u>
<u n="757" who="S0012">that's right yeah but er when we when we were at school I mean I'm talking yonks ago now our science teacher was very good at that sort of thing and he actually there was a just this tiny about as big as your fingernail tiniest bit of material I don't know what it was to this very day I don't know what it was but he had all these bits of material and <trunc>s</trunc> he like they get bigger and bigger and bigger right</u>
<u n="758" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="759" who="S0012">and he said which do you think is the heaviest?</u>
<u n="760" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="761" who="S0012">and you could see like a house brick right well that's heavy you know but it went down to this little tiny piece of stuff and you couldn't lift it with two fingers you you know you'd have to have something to get underneath it and and lift it up god knows what it was but er ah he was a brilliant science teacher mind you he did he did blow up the he he did blow up the the classroom but he was he was really good Mr <pause dur="short"/><anon type="name" nameType="n"/> his name was</u>
<u n="762" who="S0008">the thing is though is that the amazing thing is is that when we went to school and learnt about things like that people didn't know nothing</u>
<u n="763" who="S0012">no we knew nothing no</u>
<u n="764" who="S0008">they didn't know nothing the teachers you know even the highest trained teachers didn't know anything</u>
<u n="765" who="S0012">well yeah</u>
<u n="766" who="S0008">and they'd teach you stuff and of course it wasn't till like Fred Hoyle came in and started</u>
<u n="767" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="768" who="S0008">working out all these in like in the sort of seventies and stuff sixties seventies</u>
<u n="769" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="770" who="S0008">and then people since then you know like I mean the the knowledge curve has sort of gone</u>
<u n="771" who="S0012">well it has hasn't it? yeah</u>
<u n="772" who="S0008">you know like gradual and then suddenly shot up like</u>
<u n="773" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="774" who="S0008">with these new of course with the space telescopes and things</u>
<u n="775" who="S0012">they're fantastic</u>
<u n="776" who="S0008">you know and these new telescopes they got these <trunc>elect</trunc> er what do you call them? electric electronic telescopes</u>
<u n="777" who="S0012">yeah they can see right out of that's fantastic innit? er but what they did on this programme was they've got infrared telescope ultraviolet telescope and a and another type of telescope and you see all these things in different how they are then they blended them together and that was fantastic cos the the stuff that they you could see was fantastic and this is a star multimillion mile light years away</u>
<u n="778" who="S0008">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="779" who="S0012">but because they've got all this this this different er ways of looking</u>
<u n="780" who="S0008">well that's a lot of these things you can only see on on ultraviolet or infrared or whatever</u>
<u n="781" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="782" who="S0008">you can't see them on ordinary</u>
<u n="783" who="S0012">no no you can't no</u>
<u n="784" who="S0008">and it's the same with the radio telescopes I mean they're</u>
<u n="785" who="S0012">that's right</u>
<u n="786" who="S0008">they set them up in a massive array don't they?</u>
<u n="787" who="S0012">yeah they do yeah</u>
<u n="788" who="S0008">and like it's not just one building it's like they're dotted in a sort of like ten kilometre circle</u>
<u n="789" who="S0012">that's right</u>
<u n="790" who="S0008">and they're each going up and getting radio waves and then combining it</u>
<u n="791" who="S0012">but that they got them in Chile in <trunc>Aus</trunc> in Australia all on these big highest mountains they got</u>
<u n="792" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="793" who="S0012">loads and loads I don't know how many but loads of all these different all all following the same</u>
<u n="794" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="795" who="S0012">track and looking at the same thing</u>
<u n="796" who="S0008">they're not</u>
<u n="797" who="S0012" trans="overlap">and they're not looking at a supernova that is due to happen at any time</u>
<u n="798" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="799" who="S0012">and then they're hoping to catch the actual supernova which will cos they're no change in colour the whole lot is just well light years away but</u>
<u n="800" who="S0008">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="801" who="S0012">they found it</u>
<u n="802" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="803" who="S0008">but it's you know but like I say this is so interesting but like I say it's difficult to keep it in your head</u>
<u n="804" who="S0012">that is difficult to keep in your head</u>
<u n="805" who="S0008">it's so <trunc>fa</trunc> you know it's so</u>
<u n="806" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="807" who="S0012">especially at our age <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="808" who="S0008">well it's so so erm</u>
<u n="809" who="S0013" trans="overlap">no for anyone I reckon</u>
<u n="810" who="S0012">well I don't know</u>
<u n="811" who="S0008" trans="overlap">yeah cos it's so mind boggling</u>
<u n="812" who="S0013" trans="overlap">otherwise you'd be an expert wouldn't you? in the beginning</u>
<u n="813" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="814" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="815" who="S0008">I mean it's so mind boggling really</u>
<u n="816" who="S0013">that is isn't it?</u>
<u n="817" who="S0008">you know cos they you know the thing is you think oh I understand that I think I and then they say and that's forty million light years away</u>
<u n="818" who="S0012">yeah what?</u>
<u n="819" who="S0008">you start thinking about that and you think ah I've forgotten already</u>
<u n="820" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="821" who="S0008">if it's something in your hand you can understand it but when they talk about light years</u>
<u n="822" who="S0012">that's right</u>
<u n="823" who="S0008">and billions of light years</u>
<u n="824" who="S0012">and when you think of what space is what is it?</u>
<u n="825" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="826" who="S0012">is there any beginning or any end?</u>
<u n="827" who="S0008">no this is it</u>
<u n="828" who="S0012" trans="overlap">there can't be can it?</u>
<u n="829" who="S0008" trans="overlap">the big the big question innit? what was there before the big bang?</u>
<u n="830" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="831" who="S0012">well something was there before the big bang had to be</u>
<u n="832" who="S0008">well not necessarily cos they reckon</u>
<u n="833" who="S0012">yeah but they were</u>
<u n="834" who="S0008">in in the big bang you created a load of positive mass and a load of negative mass right?</u>
<u n="835" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah but there had to be some whole</u>
<u n="836" who="S0008">and if you put them together there'd be nothing left right it's it's like if if you if you dug a hole in the garden you created say that's the big bang you created all the earth you've taken out in the hole</u>
<u n="837" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="838" who="S0008">right so you think well <trunc>y</trunc> there's two things being created but then you haven't created anything because if you put the earth back in the hole there's nothing there again</u>
<u n="839" who="S0012">no that's right but the</u>
<u n="840" who="S0008"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="841" who="S0012">when you when you talk about nothing</u>
<u n="842" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="843" who="S0012">er there's nothing it's it's too hard to contemplate there's there's</u>
<u n="844" who="S0008" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="845" who="S0012">got to be something to bring the nothings together there's got to be something</u>
<u n="846" who="S0008" trans="overlap">well that's right I mean it's sort of like it's more difficult to er comprehend than is there a god? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="847" who="S0012">well yeah</u>
<u n="848" who="S0008">well no it's easier to comprehend than is there a god cos</u>
<u n="849" who="S0012">well that's just a belief</u>
<u n="850" who="S0013" trans="overlap">I don't know it's all connected isn't it?</u>
<u n="851" who="S0008" trans="overlap">it's <unclear/> this is why people created god didn't they?</u>
<u n="852" who="S0013" trans="overlap">it really is all connected</u>
<u n="853" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah it's all connected</u>
<u n="854" who="S0008" trans="overlap">cos they cos they want something to be in charge</u>
<u n="855" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="856" who="S0012">they want some</u>
<u n="857" who="S0008">and some reason</u>
<u n="858" who="S0012">somebody must have made it you see</u>
<u n="859" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="860" who="S0012">but when that come to somebody must have made that who made the somebody who made it?</u>
<u n="861" who="S0008">right that's right I mean this is the question what what was before the big bang and where did god come from?</u>
<u n="862" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="863" who="S0008">who created god?</u>
<u n="864" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="865" who="S0008">cos he couldn't have always been there but that's the answer you get innit?</u>
<u n="866" who="S0012">yeah yeah I mean when you when you think of it and go really deep into it that's just impossible to really understand innit?</u>
<u n="867" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="868" who="S0008">well <pause dur="short"/> for the likes of us probably</u>
<u n="869" who="S0012">well for the likes of everybody they're just all they're all they're coming up with is theory theory theory theory nobody</u>
<u n="870" who="S0008" trans="overlap">well no cos they do prove it occasionally don't they?</u>
<u n="871" who="S0012">yeah they prove but they can't prove at what really really happened what happened before the big bang and all that</u>
<u n="872" who="S0008">no</u>
<u n="873" who="S0012">there's no proof there</u>
<u n="874" who="S0008">yeah but they're they're getting</u>
<u n="875" who="S0013">where did the stars come from before they?</u>
<u n="876" who="S0008">they're work</u>
<u n="877" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="878" who="S0008">they're working down to it aren't they?</u>
<u n="879" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="880" who="S0008">that's what they're working towards</u>
<u n="881" who="S0012">they're very clever people</u>
<u n="882" who="S0008">they are</u>
<u n="883" who="S0012">very clever people I mean they <trunc>ca</trunc></u>
<u n="884" who="S0008" trans="overlap">they you see they but like I say they spend like a lifetime</u>
<u n="885" who="S0012">doing it yeah</u>
<u n="886" who="S0008">working on one little aspect</u>
<u n="887" who="S0012" trans="overlap">working it out yeah</u>
<u n="888" who="S0008">and they know everything about it and they've worked it all out in their head and they sort of</u>
<u n="889" who="S0012" trans="overlap">that's right</u>
<u n="890" who="S0008">I mean it would be a real bugger if someone came along and said oh sorry I've just proved you wrong</u>
<u n="891" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="892" who="S0008">oh my lifetime's work</u>
<u n="893" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="894" who="S0008">which must happen</u>
<u n="895" who="S0012">that's gotta happen well it did happen once or twice didn't it? I mean</u>
<u n="896" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="897" who="S0012">that's somebody tried to <trunc>pr</trunc>prove Einstein's theory wrong didn't they? but I mean that that can't be</u>
<u n="898" who="S0008">well I don't think they tried to prove it wrong but they sort of like</u>
<u n="899" who="S0012">well they didn't prove it</u>
<u n="900" who="S0008">it opens up a lot of erm possibilities which aren't catered for in the theories</u>
<u n="901" who="S0012">in the theory yeah</u>
<u n="902" who="S0008">and then they try and fit these you know</u>
<u n="903" who="S0012" trans="overlap">things altogether</u>
<u n="904" who="S0008">you know other fit it altogether and then suddenly find see this is how you progress in astronomy and nuclear physics or anything or</u>
<u n="905" who="S0012" trans="overlap">well yes <trunc>nu</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="906" who="S0008">anything like that is that something'll be accepted and it'll be accepted for several years you know?</u>
<u n="907" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="908" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="909" who="S0008">and all the time there's people beavering away trying to prove <trunc>so</trunc>something</u>
<u n="910" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="911" who="S0008">connected to it how they're trying to fit it in</u>
<u n="912" who="S0013">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="913" who="S0008">and then they <trunc>sa</trunc> cos this is the thing with Fred Hoyle's theory about er the the er nuclei in stars and stuff like this</u>
<u n="914" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="915" who="S0008">which sorted out a lot of stuff and er his theories were accepted for ages but there was something he says well someone worked out how much carbon there was in the in the er galaxy</u>
<u n="916" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="917" who="S0008">and er god knows how</u>
<u n="918" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="919" who="S0008">and er then this the amount of carbon was much too much to be associated</u>
<u n="920" who="S0012">with</u>
<u n="921" who="S0008">with the original ideas Fred Hoyle's ideas right?</u>
<u n="922" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="923" who="S0008">and so he this guy you know he sort of like bugged him and he was sort of working on this for about god knows how many years</u>
<u n="924" who="S0012">years yeah</u>
<u n="925" who="S0008">and then he came up with this supernova idea which then explained which agreed with Fred Hoyle</u>
<u n="926" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="927" who="S0008">up to a point but said that okay this his happens but if it's too big then it creates supernova and this is what creates all the carbon</u>
<u n="928" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="929" who="S0008">you see?</u>
<u n="930" who="S0012">oh I see yeah yeah</u>
<u n="931" who="S0008">cos it cos you know no one could have an idea that you know sorts out everything</u>
<u n="932" who="S0012">no no that's true</u>
<u n="933" who="S0008">you know you can only sort out one little bit and er</u>
<u n="934" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="935" who="S0008">it's like the light theory isn't it?</u>
<u n="936" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="937" who="S0008">about whether it's a wave or a or a pulse</u>
<u n="938" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="939" who="S0008">and er then they come up to say it's a pulse working in a wave</u>
<u n="940" who="S0012">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="941" who="S0008">but you know someone come up and sort that out eventually if they haven't already done so</u>
<u n="942" who="S0012" trans="overlap">well they will yeah yeah but the nice thing about all this science stuff and and they there are scientists from all over the world working together on things aren't they?</u>
<u n="943" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="944" who="S0012">I mean they're all collaborating</u>
<u n="945" who="S0008">yeah course they are</u>
<u n="946" who="S0012">and they never used to did they?</u>
<u n="947" who="S0008" trans="overlap"><unclear>I don't know</unclear></u>
<u n="948" who="S0012">it used to be</u>
<u n="949" who="S0008">well I suppose there's</u>
<u n="950" who="S0012">a pocket of scientists</u>
<u n="951" who="S0008">it's so expensive now that they have to sort of like utilise what they can</u>
<u n="952" who="S0012" trans="overlap">they have to collaborate yeah yeah that's fantastic I mean the Russian scientists and the American scientists working together</u>
<u n="953" who="S0008">sometimes</u>
<u n="954" who="S0012">well lots of the time you know I mean</u>
<u n="955" who="S0008" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="956" who="S0012">but it's only the politicians that are not working together</u>
<u n="957" who="S0008">yeah <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="958" who="S0012">and that's awful when politics come into it that's that becomes stupid</u>
