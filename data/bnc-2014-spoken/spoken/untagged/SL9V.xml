<u n="332" who="S0234">wow okay</u>
<u n="333" who="S0192">I only had one full sibling and now I have a half sibling as well bit strange yeah five years old bit weird when you're like twenty-eight and you've got a brother that's five</u>

<u n="335" who="S0192">I don't really know what to do with it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="336" who="S0234">I was trying yeah so yeah cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was my eldest was only yeah he was fourteen obviously when</u>
<u n="337" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="338" who="S0234"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was born so he was nineteen when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was five</u>
<u n="339" who="S0192">that's a pretty big age difference still</u>
<u n="340" who="S0234">yeah that's that's like normally that's about the biggest that I've heard of actually</u>
<u n="341" who="S0192" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah yeah so now this is twenty-three years <pause dur="short"/> it just worries me cos when he's older like I mean he's been alive for five years <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I have lived out of the country for six years so I don't really know him yeah I've probably been in England for three or four months out of that whole six years so that's all I've seen really since nowadays we have Skype and stuff so it's <unclear>good</unclear> he chats to me and I see him growing up but it's a bit strange your brother's someone that you grow up with you know I mean not just not just someone with</u>
<u n="342" who="S0234" trans="overlap">yeah no that's what I was just thinking actually I was just thinking I wonder I mean that's I definitely like with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> like I feel probably slightly closer to my elder brothers because obviously when although I grew up with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> there was like pretty much when he was in I guess his informative years you know when he when you're sort of a teenager</u>
<u n="343" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0234">I'd gone off to university</u>

<u n="347" who="S0192">so you drifted a little bit</u>
<u n="348" who="S0234">yeah I think so whereas obviously when I <pause dur="short"/> when I was a teenager at least <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was still around and my eldest was still around a bit and then he went off</u>
<u n="349" who="S0192">yeah are you close with your your brothers now?</u>
<u n="350" who="S0234">yeah yeah like we see each other quite a lot actually erm</u>
<u n="351" who="S0192">that's good</u>
<u n="352" who="S0234">so that's quite good but it's <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's kind of I mean it's difficult I mean it's difficult even with friends I think nowadays too</u>
<u n="353" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="354" who="S0234">cos everyone moves around so although both my brothers are relatively <unclear/> one's in <anon type="place"/> yeah which is just north of London</u>
<u n="355" who="S0192">yeah I I know <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="360" who="S0234">erm and then the other one is in basically in <anon type="place"/> pretty close outside of <anon type="place"/> so obviously when I was in <anon type="place"/> it was quite funny cos when I rang my parents to say I'm going to go erm to <anon type="place"/> to do my PhD they were like oh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s moving to like to the there</u>

<u n="364" who="S0234">erm so I saw quite a lot of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> then but yeah it's er</u>
<u n="365" who="S0192">my brother my proper brother is erm going to uni at the same time that we are as well but he's going to <anon type="place"/> erm but he's twenty-four so he should have gone to uni when he was eighteen nineteen but he never did he went to college kinda fluffed that a couple of times so it's a bit coincidental that we're both going to uni at the same time <unclear/> not too far either is it? <anon type="place"/> from <anon type="place"/> <unclear>at the moment</unclear></u>
<u n="366" who="S0234">well also probably again is like you just go into London and then</u>

<u n="370" who="S0234">okay</u>
<u n="371" who="S0192">and it was gonna cost about forty pound for a day return and it was still gonna take three hours to do sixty miles so an average speed of twenty miles an hour on the train I mean we're talking third world speeds here at that point you know what I mean? twenty miles an hour <pause dur="short"/> erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I many times in Nepal which I remember that clearly cos I calculated how long it was taking us the amount of ten twelve hour journeys we were doing and only covering like a hundred miles or a hundred kilometres sometimes I mean you'd be like average speed of fifteen kilometres for the last twelve hours</u>

<u n="485" who="S0192">that's what you were talking</u>
<u n="486" who="S0233">it mostly my issues with going to <anon type="place"/> were is that the college needs a guarantee that you're going to be able to provide evidence of your living costs for the next year</u>
<u n="487" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="488" who="S0233">so basically I had to show them how I was going to live because you're not allowed to work</u>
<u n="489" who="S0198">okay</u>
<u n="490" who="S0233">erm</u>
<u n="491" who="S0192">you're not allowed to work?</u>
<u n="492" who="S0234">no it's actually against college er statute</u>
<u n="493" who="S0233" trans="overlap">you need to ask <pause dur="short"/> like you can get work</u>
<u n="494" who="S0192" trans="overlap">interesting</u>
<u n="495" who="S0233">like you maybe you can get sort of like some work doing sort of tutoring or things like that but generally you would have to ask for special permission</u>
<u n="496" who="S0234" trans="overlap">you can't go and work at Sainsbury's</u>
<u n="497" who="S0233">no you can't go and get a job in a Lush or whatever</u>
<u n="498" who="S0192">just because the workload is too high then <unclear/> they're not allowed</u>
<u n="499" who="S0198" trans="overlap">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> what else you normally do be doing</u>
<u n="500" who="S0233">because they because they want you to spend your time doing stuff that's enriching you in terms of</u>
<u n="501" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="502" who="S0234">yeah so so you should be in plays in your spare time rather than</u>
<u n="503" who="S0233" trans="overlap"><unclear/> not your personal studies but other things like that</u>
<u n="504" who="S0198">ah okay yeah</u>
<u n="505" who="S0192">interesting of course you need to have the finances to support yourself though</u>
<u n="506" who="S0233">yes so I had a career development loan</u>
<u n="507" who="S0198">okay</u>
<u n="508" who="S0233">which I took out and at some point it was fine but then towards the end of the year I actually did need erm not financial assistance but college I college had to be nicer to me and they gave me some money to sort myself sort myself out</u>
<u n="509" who="S0198">yeah access to learning fund</u>
<u n="510" who="S0192">so if you do start working what? Inland Revenue contacts the university?</u>

<u n="512" who="S0234">you can get thrown out of the university</u>
<u n="513" who="S0233">that wouldn't happen though there's probably just <trunc>caut</trunc> the I think the idea is that they just want you to talk it through with them in fact if I had gone today to them oh I'm struggling a bit financially do you mind if I work a <trunc>coup</trunc> a few hours on a Saturday at one of the shops in town? they'd probably be okay with it but</u>
<u n="514" who="S0192">I mean how can you tell people you can't work?</u>
<u n="515" who="S0198" trans="overlap">is that the same for undergraduates as well?</u>
<u n="516" who="S0233">it's probably more strict with undergraduates</u>
<u n="517" who="S0234" trans="overlap">it's it's very strict with undergraduates I actually know cos I was talking to one of the erm lecturers about this and I actually know they in Queen's they told someone that they had to stop work</u>
<u n="518" who="S0192" trans="overlap">wow</u>
<u n="519" who="S0233" trans="overlap">but but the reason for that the reason for that is because undergraduates like I at <anon type="place"/> and I don't know how it was at <anon type="place"/> but it was ten week blocks</u>
<u n="520" who="S0198">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="521" who="S0233">their blocks are eight weeks and I reckon</u>
<u n="522" who="S0234">and they also have lectures on a Saturday</u>
<u n="523" who="S0233">yes well it depends on your course it definitely seems a bit definitely like</u>

<u n="532" who="S0234">for the first he turned up first like oh lectures I must go and then realised that basically no one goes to the lectures and they just</u>
<u n="533" who="S0233" trans="overlap">cos they spend their time in the library</u>

<u n="936" who="S0198">yeah we had to pay for an external company to</u>
<u n="937" who="S0192">to reference us which was really difficult to do</u>
<u n="938" who="S0234" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="939" who="S0198">and we had to deal with them directly</u>
<u n="940" who="S0233" trans="overlap">I wonder</u>
<u n="941" who="S0198">our agency just gave us their details</u>
<u n="942" who="S0192">so they're telling can you send us bills? I don't pay bills well what's your <trunc>addre</trunc>? I don't you know my address it' s all in Korea</u>

<u n="944" who="S0198">well we were doing this from</u>
<u n="945" who="S0192" trans="overlap">well we were still in Korea</u>
<u n="946" who="S0198">Korea</u>
<u n="947" who="S0192">so we had to get our bosses who don't speak amazing English to fill out all this paperwork saying that yes we do live here yes they do pay our bills and they pay all this it was really stressful</u>
<u n="948" who="S0198">it was annoying because</u>
<u n="949" who="S0192" trans="overlap">they wanted like bank statements we don't get bank statements we don't have them</u>
<u n="950" who="S0198">it was stupid</u>
<u n="951" who="S0234">ah see when we we moved into the London one as soon as we paid six months in advance because I didn't have a job</u>
<u n="952" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="953" who="S0234">and I knew that we wouldn't pass the credit check</u>
<u n="954" who="S0233" trans="overlap">actually yeah that was <unclear/> wasn't it? the check</u>
<u n="955" who="S0234">because I didn't have I had enough money to pay it's like you basically I could have paid a year in advance so I just said look if I pay six months in advance</u>
<u n="956" who="S0233">is that fine?</u>
<u n="957" who="S0234">is that fine?</u>
<u n="958" who="S0233">cos it's a six month contract anyway isn't it?</u>
<u n="959" who="S0234" trans="overlap">and they didn't and they didn't <unclear/></u>
<u n="960" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah that's exactly what we said isn't it?</u>
<u n="961" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but we were telling them that I said I'll pay you six months I'll pay a year and she basically said that</u>
<u n="962" who="S0198" trans="overlap">I think it's because we were abroad</u>
<u n="963" who="S0192">yeah I think so they didn't trust us yeah they wanted to make sure we were legitimate</u>
<u n="964" who="S0198" trans="overlap">regardless of whether we transfer them the money or not but that <unclear/></u>
<u n="965" who="S0192">now we've still paid them six months up front because actually we failed the reference check which really stressed us out cos it took two weeks of every day emailing contacting ringing trying to get paperwork I finally get it alright and then something's wrong with it so I have to do something it was really laborious and then erm yeah they just tell us they failed us so now we have to get guarantors and and we're worried about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s parents you know her dad's retired her mum's not on that much money like are they gonna pass you know what I mean? erm so I appealed it and found out that the reason that we failed was because we had the savings in our account and we had enough savings but we'd been in Cambodia for a few weeks before now I don't keep all my savings in the account that I travel on it's not a good idea so I move it into a digital account and then when I got back into Korea I moved it back in all they saw was that I moved the money back into my account and the money hadn't been in my account long enough so they didn't trust it</u>
<u n="966" who="S0234">ah</u>
<u n="967" who="S0192">so I had to I mean they could have just told me</u>

<u n="969" who="S0192" trans="overlap">they just didn't look there so I had to appeal that and that took another week</u>

<u n="1015" who="S0192">personally I think we have the capacity to become almost completely paperless at the minute I don't think we even need to print anything if people just accepted things more by email a lot</u>
<u n="1016" who="S0233">my library hurdles were encounters at the British Library because you need to have erm hard copies of your things that prove you are who you are</u>

<u n="1165" who="S0233">but that's like</u>

<u n="1167" who="S0233">they wind each other up</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0198">yeah yeah</u>

<u n="1171" who="S0233">ten</u>
<u n="1172" who="S0198">ah really? does she look a lot like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> still? does it freak you out?</u>
<u n="1173" who="S0234">I don't think she looks like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I think you she looks like a probably thinks she looks like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> cos I think she looks like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> when <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was younger</u>
<u n="1174" who="S0198">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1175" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1176" who="S0198">a younger <unclear/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s thirteen?</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0233">twelve</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0198">twelve</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0233">going to year eight</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0198">yeah does he like <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0233">yeah</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0198">he does?</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0233">yeah I think so</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0198"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s going there next year</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and school's compulsory now until eighteen isn't it?</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0233" trans="overlap">yeah he says they've erm mm we he's</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0234">is that true?</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0233">it's quite a big school isn't it?</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I don't know you've lived here longer than I <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1190" who="S0234">don't tell me stuff I don't know</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0192">that's what that's what I heard yeah</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0233">well it's obviously chapter in</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it's compulsory until eighteen</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0233">erm I think</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0234">that can't be right</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0192">apparently so</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0234">though</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0192">apparently there were like colleges are the country got a lot more people now like I have friends that have been kind of kind of through the back door into colleges because apparently there's been a rise I think it's this year or last year got a lot more people coming <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> knows more about it than I do but</u>
<event desc="begin overlap"/>
<u n="1199" who="S0234">but that whole erm what do you call it when you do er apprentices?</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0192">yeah okay baccalaureate sort of thing</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0234">I wonder whether they they're just trying to now do it so you can maybe you can stay like you don't have to stay in school or join an official apprentice programme</u>
<u n="1202" who="S0192">yeah perhaps there's one or the other but you have to do something personally I don't see a problem with finishing school maybe maybe eighteen I don't think you should go to university immediately</u>
<u n="1203" who="S0234">no no</u>
<u n="1204" who="S0192">I think you shouldn't be able to go to uni at least until you're twenty-one I think that's it's too big a debt to hand people obviously some people their parents pay for it or they get bursaries and grants that kind of stuff but for the majority of people to <pause dur="short"/> say that at the age of seventeen you're no adult who can't be tried under the justice system effectively but then a day after your eighteenth birthday here's a fifty thousand pound loan for the rest of your life that you're just signing up to I think that's too big a decision to make at the age of eighteen I think you should give it three years of work travel whatever you need to do and then it might mean that certain people don't go to university because and other people that wouldn't have do now because they're I think they would change it I would I honestly <trunc>thin</trunc> I thought about it quite a bit but I think twenty-one should be the minimum age</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0234">ah I mean I think it's I the biggest problem is the raising of fees which is just a big mistake</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0192">yeah it really is going the American style as opposed to European style I mean we we really wanted to study in erm one of our major choices was the University of <unclear/> in the Netherlands</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0234">the Netherlands yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0192">top hundred world university teaches in English does the course we wanna do tuition fees a thousand pounds a year not six thousand pounds a year cost of living equitable slightly less maybe couldn't do it I applied to numerous jobs around the <trunc>co</trunc> around the world and they were telling me no your master's degree must be from a native English speaking country so it has to be from one of the five or six native can't be from doesn't matter it a top hundred uni does matter that they teach in English doesn't matter that they're basically bilingual and then</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0234">hopefully yeah the Netherlands is like the best non native speaking English people I think</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0192">you think it would be allowed wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0234">yeah</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0192">I think for if we do a PhD we'd like to try and do it in the States or in Canada erm they seem to have a little bit more funding out there</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0234">oh oh I will say</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0192" trans="overlap">you can get it</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0234">you can do teaching during your PhD</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0192">yes</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0234">as well</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0192">as an adjust professor yeah erm <pause dur="short"/> so basically we and we kinda wanna get dual citizenship with a slightly larger country at some point so maybe getting our foot in the door in America or in Canada or</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0234">that's yeah that's a good idea</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0192">ideally I'd like to live in Argentina but I don't think they're gonna <unclear>take</unclear> me too much not so easy <pause dur="short"/> tertiary education system is not quite as good out there at the moment <pause dur="short"/> korean is terrible I mean most people in England seem to know that Korea has a really good education system or at least so I hear it's like second in the world sometimes</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0234" trans="overlap">well I know like the one I know is mostly Singapore</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0192">yes</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0234">and that school right level is more than I mean I know the university's meant to be reasonable but</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0192">I mean Korean's I'm not gonna lie like at you know middle school they're doing some pretty complicated mathematical equations that we would still be doing with a calculator at like probably lower university maybe even up I I don't know I still <unclear/> I really don't know but it was beyond what I was doing then it was pretty complicated stuff however <unclear/> learning's really good and kind of creative thought none whatsoever none and they work them to death and like ninety-five percent of the country goes to university so it has the same population as England and it's roughly equitable size as well but they have more than double the amount of universities that we have they've got over three hundred and fifty unis in the country so <pause dur="short"/> the education system there mostly wrong I think just strange that most people at least I met in the west kinda think it has a really good education system I think it's terrible</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0234">well there's I mean we so there was a thing that came out actually in the news about how England there's a table of education</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0192">oh just recently we're like eleventh or something?</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0234" trans="overlap">yeah yeah we were quite low down like we dropped a place or two I think?</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0192">Finland first</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0234">yeah</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0192">they work less hours they have less homework they go to school when they're older <pause dur="short"/> I really it's gonna be difficult for me to have different ideas about you know the education system but has to work in education within the system for the whole I honestly believe that education should be a lifelong process you know you're not graded C at sixteen and then you carry this grade with you for the rest of your life and you can't change a lot of people seem to you know <pause dur="short"/> they'll do as well roughly as what they were told they were gonna do at like sixteen I have friends that were like sixteen they were told they were a C or a D grade student and they carry that forever and they're kinda like you know no I'm dyslexic I've got this I can't do that and I can't do this so I'm just</u>
<u n="1231" who="S0234">oh no I know I always say to people I could get anyone an A star in mathematics</u>
<u n="1232" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0234">easily</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0192">I'm sure you could</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0234">one one on one tutoring</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0192">we're all human right we have the capacity to understand these</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0234">also it's not that hard <vocal desc="laugh"/> it really isn't I mean</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0192">most people just shy away from it because it has you know a reputation for being like that I'm not gonna like I'm not particularly mathematically inclined but when I did maths at school I did fine in it it wasn't a problem I just found it boring it <unclear/></u>
<u n="1239" who="S0234">it is erm for the it is boring <trunc>ac</trunc></u>
<u n="1240" who="S0192">it's not applicable there's no what do you do with it? you're like well I can do some basic division yeah and some basic adding but what do I need the rest for?</u>
<u n="1241" who="S0234">well it's cos it's cool <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1242" who="S0192">just yeah it's cool to have it</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0234">no but it <trunc>i</trunc> I mean if you and that's the other thing I find with it it's they don't teach you all the interesting mathematics</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0192">no okay</u>
<u n="1245" who="S0234">and they don't teach you like everyone knows Pythagoras' theorem but they don't really understand why it's ridiculous erm how it was has been known for like a really long time</u>
<u n="1246" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0234">and that sort of gets your interest and thinking like so this <trunc>gu</trunc> really really far back who was thinking about you know triangles then and why was he thinking about triangles and what's special about triangles?</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0192">obviously</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0234">the deeper meaning of mathematics rather than just oh I need to know the A square plus B square equals C square</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0192" trans="overlap">just to pass it</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0234">to come and pass the test</u>
<u n="1252" who="S0192">yeah yeah we just need a complete revamp of how I mean maybe teachers are better nowadays than they were when we were in school but I certainly know that how <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I teach English isn't how French was being taught to us at school not at all methodology's moved on a lot since then</u>
<u n="1253" who="S0234">mm well I mean I know I know a lot of people at <anon type="place"/> who were in the education department in fact one of the guys who was the president of the MCR when I was the secretary erm he he goes around the world and is a speaker in education <unclear/> I've no idea what why he's going around but he's Australian so oh actually he's from New Zealand but he's <trunc>taugh</trunc> he basically does a lot with the education in our Australia and they have meetings like I think it seems like they're trying to moved education what it probably used where it's like I think before at least when I was growing up and then probably before that it was a case of this is what we used this is how we used to teach you know your dad was taught like this so now we're gonna teach like this</u>
<u n="1254" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1255" who="S0234">whereas now it seems like they're trying to break the</u>
<u n="1256" who="S0192" trans="overlap">very restrictive learning</u>
<u n="1257" who="S0234">yeah they're trying to all these <unclear/> of trying to learn how to teach people which <trunc>some</trunc>sometimes I question</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0192">yeah no of course yeah</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0234">it doesn't <trunc>sui</trunc> like they've apparently they've stopped teaching long division</u>
<u n="1260" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1261" who="S0234">so they're now doing another way of dividing big numbers</u>
<u n="1262" who="S0192">ah interesting</u>
<u n="1263" who="S0234">not the standard long division where you you know you start</u>
<u n="1264" who="S0192">is it more efficient?</u>
<u n="1265" who="S0234">it's meant to be a lot more efficient but</u>
<u n="1266" who="S0192">progress</u>
<u n="1267" who="S0234">it's incredibly complicated</u>
<u n="1268" who="S0192">oh okay</u>
<u n="1269" who="S0234">to try and get your head it doesn't seem logical I think</u>
<u n="1270" who="S0192">well minimalism is an important thing for learners <unclear/> I'm reading a book about analysing English <trunc>set</trunc> sort of like syntactic theory like Chomsky's syntactic theory like Chomsky's transformational grammar and stuff and one of the main components of making their parametric theory is like erm <pause dur="short"/> minimalism basically make it as simple as possible so that <trunc>wel</trunc> if it's ever applied to people you can learn it easy you shouldn't be making these things overly complex but it should be looking for the simplest way of doing something the quickest and simplest</u>
<u n="1271" who="S0234">but but that's what I mean is is that the simplest one is the quickest the quickest is not always the simplest</u>
<u n="1272" who="S0192">no not necessarily <unclear/> I guess you have to take a way <unclear>up</unclear>  which one is it?</u>
<u n="1273" who="S0234" trans="overlap">yeah it's interesting</u>
<u n="1274" who="S0198">oh wow</u>
<u n="1275" who="S0233">and I'd like school if or even sport cos I actually quite like sport now</u>
<u n="1276" who="S0198">yeah yeah no <unclear/> classes when I was fourteen</u>
<u n="1277" who="S0233">it was disgusting it wasn't just the fact <unclear/> PE teachers it was the other</u>
<u n="1278" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="1279" who="S0233">the really bad changing facilities like really gross <unclear/> now I think they have like hair dryers and hair straighteners and stuff <unclear/> and things like that I was like</u>
<u n="1280" who="S0198">I stopped <unclear/> I didn't enjoy it at all I was too conscious it was not <unclear/></u>
<u n="1281" who="S0233">and there wasn't anything to do it was like <unclear/> now now they do basically we did like dance which is basically all the girls I hated <unclear/> dance routine</u>
<u n="1282" who="S0198">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1283" who="S0233">or <trunc>round</trunc>rounders which was okay and that's about it <unclear/> girls never did football</u>
<u n="1284" who="S0198">no we never got to play football</u>
<u n="1285" who="S0233">I remember we had like some shitty <unclear/> just uninspiring whereas now I think they offer them things like yoga and</u>
<u n="1286" who="S0198">yeah <unclear/> emphasis on doing sports really <unclear/> same with languages system of teaching languages like don't know about <anon type="place"/> but <anon type="place"/> was horrible</u>
<u n="1287" who="S0233">I think best person to ask would probably be <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1288" who="S0198">yeah I know <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="1289" who="S0198">where will <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> go? is she about to take her eleven plus?</u>
<u n="1290" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1291" who="S0198"><unclear/> cucumber <unclear/> really the back of my throat</u>
<u n="1292" who="S0233">basically <unclear/> couple of the practice tests and she's borderline</u>
<u n="1293" who="S0198">okay</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0233">mum basically says that she thinks <unclear/> she like daydreams a lot</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0233">she's not very focused</u>

<u n="1298" who="S0233">it's not that she's not smart enough it's just</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0198">no I'm sure she'll be alright wherever she goes</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0233">I think she'll realise though because she's got a friend that's like oh are you going to go to <anon type="place"/> or something?</u>

<u n="1305" who="S0233">so I was using <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s phone for the time we were out there <unclear/> something like that <unclear/> maybe pull her socks up she will be doing exams but whether she gets above the mark don't think she'd get a place at <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="1306" who="S0198">no yeah</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0233">might squeeze into somewhere like <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="1308" who="S0198">is it more competitive there? <unclear/> very competitive</u>
<u n="1309" who="S0233"><unclear/> competitive</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0198">so they go by your grades</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0233"><unclear/> I think like you pick your top <unclear>few</unclear> choices and then the school decides how they want</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0198">oh wow</u>
<u n="1313" who="S0233">at <unclear/> they'll probably just go down the list <unclear/> places we'll take the top one hundred that said they wanted to come here</u>
<u n="1314" who="S0198">yeah <unclear/> didn't think about <unclear/></u>
<u n="1315" who="S0233">I think the exam is the exam must be in a few weeks actually</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0198">yeah she's going into year six now is she? ah jesus</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0233">cos I didn't take it</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0198">no you didn't at that age wouldn't did you take it when you were thirteen?</u>
<u n="1319" who="S0233">no I had to go cos like mum and dad were trying to get me to leave <anon type="place"/> so I went to do the entrance exams at <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="1321" who="S0233">er for <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="1322" who="S0198">okay</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0233">the problem is is that I really liked <unclear/> cos it was mixed but it was really far away</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0233">and they often <unclear/> Chatham <unclear/> and <anon type="place"/> was full so I said to my mum and dad that probably was <anon type="place"/> wasn't a very nice school there were loads of bitches</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0198">yeah <unclear/> lot of girls are bitches</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0233"><unclear/> I had to spend a day hanging around with like this group of girls that were really horrible it was like well</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0198">I remember going to an open day <unclear/> don't think I ever said it to my mum but I remember all the girls there were <unclear/> I'm not going to a grammar school this is horrible it really put me off at that age</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0233">anyway I just <unclear/> so then I was just like well just go to <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="1330" who="S0198">yeah until</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0233">and then sixth form was different</u>

<u n="1335" who="S0233">sixth form wasn't even like I think it was it had been reformed or something but <unclear/></u>
<u n="1336" who="S0198">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0233">like that place was just so depressing <unclear/></u>
<u n="1338" who="S0198">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0233">just realised how <unclear/> it was how disgusting it was and how mean it was and just actually <unclear/></u>
<u n="1340" who="S0198">maybe it's still the same?</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0233">I think they tried to sort themselves out <unclear/> it's better for them to go somewhere like <anon type="place"/> so at least they've got <unclear/></u>
<u n="1342" who="S0198">yeah yeah <unclear/> recently spent the money on</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0233"><unclear/> bizarre idea that <unclear/> like not <unclear/></u>

<u n="2110" who="S0198">yeah ah there you go</u>
<u n="2111" who="S0234">that's what</u>
<u n="2112" who="S0198">is that cos it's just been bottled for longer or?</u>

<u n="2115" who="S0234">yeah I don't know exactly why but the sediment is important for the wine</u>
<u n="2116" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="2117" who="S0234">and so good wine has sediment which is why you need that bottle and then the idea is that it should all obviously it sinks to the bottom <unclear/> time</u>

<u n="2236" who="S0233">whatever I smoke occasionally now</u>
<u n="2237" who="S0198">yeah we quit for a year completely and then when we changed jobs we got a bit complacent and we were drunk and we were kind of okay we smoked like maybe one or two cigarettes every couple of weeks or something at the weekend</u>

<u n="2243" who="S0198">oh that's really angry</u>
<u n="2244" who="S0234">I don't wanna say too much about the the reason I <unclear/></u>
<u n="2245" who="S0198">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2246" who="S0234">cos I don't wanna offend you at all but erm</u>
<u n="2247" who="S0192">no you can offend</u>
<u n="2248" who="S0234">erm basically I know the er genetic side of things and what it does to you so</u>
<u n="2249" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="2250" who="S0234">I was erm</u>
<u n="2251" who="S0192">please go into detail you might help us to er quit</u>
<u n="2252" who="S0198">yeah we're trying to</u>
<u n="2253" who="S0234" trans="overlap">well so essentially you can tell erm so if I take your blood</u>
<u n="2254" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="2255" who="S0234">erm as long as you've had a cigarette in the last three months I can tell that you have and that's erm it's a little marker on your actual DNA that's changed</u>
<u n="2256" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2257" who="S0234">now you don't you don't want that to happen generally because you I mean it's not a good thing and so I think I do what really is gonna be found out hopefully in you know near future is exactly what the cause of that is and what it does</u>
<u n="2258" who="S0198">and what the implications of that is</u>
<u n="2259" who="S0234" trans="overlap">and all the implications</u>
<u n="2260" who="S0198">what the what are people suggesting at the moment?</u>
<u n="2261" who="S0234">the no one knows the problem is what it so it's the area of research that I work on it was found this marker was found er was it fifteen years ago the <trunc>orig</trunc> not the mark of smoking but the <trunc>gen</trunc> the general markers that we have on our DNA so it's a big change in philosophy between you know how you've got this nature versus nurture argument</u>
<u n="2262" who="S0198" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2263" who="S0234">well there's actually a case now where nature a lot of people believe that your environment is actually directly affecting your</u>
<u n="2264" who="S0198">DNA</u>
<u n="2265" who="S0234">DNA which is nature technically so it's not just erm you know when you're born you're pre programmed and everything you have would you know</u>
<u n="2266" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no of course</u>
<u n="2267" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="2268" who="S0234">so things like weight seem to be associated with things you could the really interesting thing for what I'm gonna do in the future is to do with ageing so it seems that these markers are particularly relevant for ageing erm and actually we can now predict someone's age within about three years which is really really cool right</u>
<u n="2269" who="S0192">like rings in a tree</u>
<u n="2270" who="S0234">erm so that really shows you how powerful this stuff is</u>
<u n="2271" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="2272" who="S0234">and of course what is really bizarre and <unclear/> was having this I mean this this big conversation last night I was in the pub with my supervisor and another erm lecturer and it's really bizarre there's no fundamental reason why we should age or even die really</u>
<u n="2273" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="2274" who="S0234">erm you can make a cell last forever</u>
<u n="2275" who="S0192">don't coy carp I swear I read something a while ago about coy carp effectively they live forever if it wasn't they got too big for their environment and then their like lungs collapse</u>
<u n="2276" who="S0234">yeah so I don't know about coy carp there are certain other examples one of the interesting examples is naked mole rat</u>
<u n="2277" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2278" who="S0198">oh yeah</u>
<u n="2279" who="S0234">lives a very long time I think that's found in Argentina South America is its erm</u>
<u n="2280" who="S0192">I've heard of it</u>
<u n="2281" who="S0234">base erm</u>
<u n="2282" who="S0198">it's an ugly fucker</u>
<u n="2283" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2284" who="S0234">largest largest colony is at my university</u>
<u n="2285" who="S0198">oh really?</u>
<u n="2286" who="S0234">which is kind of weird erm but it doesn't get cancer at all so it lives er that's why everyone's really interested in it cos obviously the biggest cause of death erm once you hit a certain age is cancer erm so <pause dur="short"/> yeah so the <trunc>rea</trunc> I guess the reason I'm saying all this is we just are finding these at the moment we know about these sort of markers and we know erm that they exist and we that they're they look like they're useful cos if you can predict age from them that must mean that age has some there's some reason why that is what we don't know is what the hell they're doing</u>
<u n="2287" who="S0192">and do you know if it's coming from the nicotine from the added chemicals?</u>
<u n="2288" who="S0234">no see that's another thing like so the smoking paper was released like three years ago and it's a really good paper because it's the one it's one of the first so before the it was before age well ageing was a bit similar time but <trunc>basic</trunc> it's very hard to show weight and and this markers associations but the smoking one is just obvious it's so easy</u>
<u n="2289" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="2290" who="S0234">its been repeated like fifty times</u>
<u n="2291" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2292" who="S0234">so it's super believable but you know what what we don't know is</u>

<u n="2619" who="S0234">yeah</u>
<u n="2620" who="S0192">so <unclear>affected them</unclear></u>

<u n="2622" who="S0192">lotus tea or whatever kind of teas they have</u>

<u n="2627" who="S0192" trans="overlap">beer and that will</u>

<u n="2629" who="S0198">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2630" who="S0234">but now it's like four or five</u>
<u n="2631" who="S0198" trans="overlap">process</u>
<u n="2632" who="S0233">but that's the same for wines as well isn't it? cos they're saying you know there's the rise of the fourteen percent bottle when actually you know a lot of wines</u>
<u n="2633" who="S0234" trans="overlap">they should be eleven or twelve yeah</u>
<u n="2634" who="S0198">ah okay</u>

<u n="2647" who="S0198">the amount of bottles that are consumed</u>

<u n="2800" who="S0234">so if they cross reference me with any other and you also sometimes you have to probably not on this one because more for the medical and you have to say whether you're in any other studies</u>
<u n="2801" who="S0198">oh right no yeah this isn't considered this is just a collection this is just to create a corpus so</u>
<u n="2802" who="S0192" trans="overlap">this is quite interesting actually all of us so basically they Cambridge University Press made a corpus do you know corpus linguistics like a body of linguistics?</u>
<u n="2803" who="UNKFEMALE" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="2804" who="S0192">they made like a corpus of written language a few years ago from the British public and now they're making a corpus of spoken <trunc>ki</trunc> you know for discourse analysis basically so if in the future this is the British national corpus two thousand and fourteen so if anyone in the future turns around and goes what did the British sound the public sound like in two thousand and fourteen? we will be in that you'll be a member of you know if anyone wants to hear what it'll be like you'll be effectively imprinted in history for the rest of your life which I think is quite interesting</u>
<u n="2805" who="S0198" trans="overlap">be in anyway</u>
<u n="2806" who="S0192">like cos I mean for social history like historians are gonna go back and</u>
<u n="2807" who="S0198" trans="overlap">the written one that they did was that when they got everyone on the internet to document that day of their lives?</u>
<u n="2808" who="S0192">I'm not sure</u>
<u n="2809" who="S0198">cos I did that</u>
<u n="2810" who="S0192">they did they did like a</u>
<u n="2811" who="S0198" trans="overlap">it was a few years ago</u>
<u n="2812" who="S0192">yeah they did like it was like a three hundred million word corpus so it was massive</u>
<u n="2813" who="S0233" trans="overlap">in London for three years</u>
<u n="2814" who="S0198">no I don't know</u>
<u n="2815" who="S0234">yes</u>
<u n="2816" who="S0198">we erm but this this run is like</u>
<u n="2817" who="S0192">yeah they pay us twenty pound an hour of recording it's pretty good yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> and we have we can we can do unlimited</u>
<u n="2818" who="S0198" trans="overlap">there's some stipulations isn't there?</u>
<u n="2819" who="S0192">yeah I mean we have to analyse it afterwards and that kind of stuff but like erm we have an unlimited amount of recordings with the same people it can be until next June they need that many recordings</u>
<u n="2820" who="S0198">so they're gonna have thousands of hours of recordings</u>
<u n="2821" who="S0234">so they</u>
<u n="2822" who="S0192">they need thousands and thousands of hours basically</u>
<u n="2823" who="S0234">so can you can someone ask for access to this data or is this?</u>
<u n="2824" who="S0192">once it's published yeah it will be a part of the corpus</u>
<u n="2825" who="S0198" trans="overlap">but as you read in that part the</u>
<u n="2826" who="S0234">Google say can I can I have all this data? cos obviously there's a lot of voice automation stuff that's been going on</u>
<u n="2827" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2828" who="S0198">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2829" who="S0234">and will they ask?</u>
<u n="2830" who="S0198">I think I wondered if this is</u>
<u n="2831" who="S0192" trans="overlap">from what they're saying they're saying that it will be used for research and for ELT purposes for teaching English and for that kind of stuff so you are you might find they take a snippet and you're on a book somewhere and but I doubt it we talk too quickly</u>
<u n="2832" who="S0198" trans="overlap">but things like I said this to my brother cos he was like really he was showing me his voice recognition on his phone and I was saying that's actually quite good because when we were in the States just two years ago and we were using Siri on the Iphone they it could understand our American friends quite well but it couldn't us at all</u>
<u n="2833" who="S0234">oh you should try I mean if you try it now it's</u>
<u n="2834" who="S0233" trans="overlap">Siri Siri does not like me</u>
<u n="2835" who="S0198">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2836" who="S0192">I've been reading quite a bit about</u>
<u n="2837" who="S0198">so I wonder if stuff like this is gonna get sold off towards stuff like that as well</u>
<u n="2838" who="S0192">thing is I've been reading a bit about computational linguistics and it's really difficult for them to make this software because it's all well and good saying you know they can make the they can understand the words but the problem is polysemy which words that have various meanings that come from the same root so if I say just a sentence on its own oh I'm feeling really high right now you don't know if high means mashed on drugs or if it means literally altitude that high and the problem with the all languages is that there is so much polysemy so it's really difficult for a computer programme to know which word you're saying then you have connected speech the computer programme needs to be able to take apart our words it's we know that we're speaking in separate words but actually it's completely connected there's no break in the speech so it's</u>
<u n="2839" who="S0198">it has definitely improved though now</u>
<u n="2840" who="S0192">it's improved but from what I've read it's really difficult to make a very good system</u>
<u n="2841" who="S0234" trans="overlap">well all all of the algorithms I</u>
<u n="2842" who="S0198" trans="overlap">thank you <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="2843" who="S0234">er basically build and work on are that <unclear/> so at one point I was thinking working</u>

<u n="2845" who="S0233">yeah</u>

<event desc="0198 leaves"/> <event desc="0233 leaves"/>

<u n="2849" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2850" who="S0234">erm and at one point I was thinking of working in that kind of field so I mean like for me that's why I was asking those questions</u>
<u n="2851" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2852" who="S0234">I'm particularly interested in it on a sort of research level</u>
<u n="2853" who="S0192">are you happy to contribute?</u>

<u n="3051" who="S0192">we'll get the other nine pound <vocal desc="laugh"/> I mean you could do that</u>
<u n="3052" who="S0233">it's not a bad little racket</u>
<u n="3053" who="S0192">no nine pound an hour's still good for just prick pressing play you know what I mean like pressing record</u>
<u n="3054" who="S0234">I still don't like where have they got the money from?</u>
<u n="3055" who="S0192">yeah it's just a lot of</u>
<u n="3056" who="S0198">it's from funding so corpus I suppose just some linguistics funding</u>
<u n="3057" who="S0192" trans="overlap">thousands and thousands of hours of recording</u>
<u n="3058" who="S0233">my boss is quite an interesting person to talk to</u>
<u n="3059" who="S0192" trans="overlap">er eight it's eighteen pound an hour</u>
<u n="3060" who="S0233">because he is Nigerian</u>
<event desc="begin overlap"/>
<u n="3061" who="S0192">and it's pro rata'd so like ten minutes is three pounds</u>
<u n="3062" who="S0234">I'm I'm surprised well I guess it's cos of the UK boom but you know there's like <trunc>prop</trunc> thing now on the internet where you can go online you can say you have jobs you can offer jobs and people do it so I was I was actually met with a company the other day that is trying to detect emotion in your voice</u>
<u n="3063" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="3064" who="S0234">erm because it's obviously apparently the big thing for is when people ring customer service centres</u>
<u n="3065" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="3066" who="S0234">what they can then do is they take the first when you first ring they you should be angry but then they can measure the performance of the service by working out whether you've diffused</u>
<u n="3067" who="S0192" trans="overlap">how much more relaxed you are yeah</u>
<u n="3068" who="S0234">whether you've diffused that and so that's what the company's based on and the biggest problem they've got is they need people to they need a database of angry voices and</u>
<u n="3069" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="3070" who="S0234">like not angry voices and try and work but of course if you say to someone act angry</u>
<u n="3071" who="S0192">it's not real</u>
<u n="3072" who="S0234">they generally like just say well they what this guy was saying is that what happens is people get louder and anything so what they're trying to do now is take movie clips</u>
<u n="3073" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="3074" who="S0234">of of various things or just general Youtube videos and so but what they then need is people to <pause dur="short"/> er determine whether that person is angry or not</u>
<u n="3075" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="3076" who="S0234">er and so what they've started to do is releasing these videos short bit of audio essentially actually so it's just audio not cos also when you also take information from the face when you're looking at a video so it's just audio</u>
<u n="3077" who="S0192">like queues on <unclear/></u>
<u n="3078" who="S0234">and they're paying people like twenty <pause dur="short"/> I think it was like twenty P or <trunc>someth</trunc> like it's absolutely no money</u>
<u n="3079" who="S0192">no and we're getting twenty quid an hour</u>
<u n="3080" who="S0234">and you're getting like twenty quid</u>
<u n="3081" who="S0192">twenty quid an hour this is perfect for us the only reason I found this is cos I signed up to the university linguistics department prior and about a month ago this was posted on that group and it just said calling you know and it's gotta be members of the British public can't be anyone else erm <pause dur="short"/> seems like too good to be true to me</u>
<u n="3082" who="S0234">well yeah that's why I asked whether you got paid <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3083" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I mean it's Cambridge University Press so it can't be too bad and they've I've already sent my invoice off I sent off twenty hours we've already got another ten hours ready to go this month</u>
<u n="3084" who="S0234">I guess you have to have the equipment though and that</u>
<u n="3085" who="S0192">yeah we had to buy these we've got one each but they were like forty quid each so after two hours you've got you've made you money back erm recording in a car is that a little bit too noisy? recording out in a park is almost like</u>
<u n="3086" who="S0234">yeah</u>
<u n="3087" who="S0192">so we need to get people in our room like is</u>
<u n="3088" who="S0234">yeah</u>
<u n="3089" who="S0192">so we can sit down and kind of do it and then I have to <trunc>ad</trunc> there's a little bit of discourse analysis afterwards just a little erm just asking me erm what were the topics would you know was it advising was it requesting was it you know anecdotal like just general it's a very quick discourse analysis based on it so I don't know what they're testing? I really don't know but various areas I would imagine one of them might be like erm topicality like what topics are people talking about depending on their relationships cos in one of the questions they ask you is you know is this close family is this friends is it loose friends is it this kind of stuff? so I guess <unclear>add to</unclear> the topics that is spoken about because they asked me to list every topic there's and I mean today how many topics have we spoken about?</u>
<u n="3090" who="S0234">mm quite a lot of topics</u>
<u n="3091" who="S0192">quite a few yeah so I have to go back and listen I don't have to listen to the whole thing</u>
<u n="3092" who="S0234">yeah you just skip through it</u>
<u n="3093" who="S0192">but I skip every few minutes</u>
<u n="3094" who="S0234">yeah</u>
<u n="3095" who="S0192">cos people talk about the same topic roughly for about three or four minutes so then it kind of changes</u>
<u n="3096" who="S0234">it could be really interesting as well like you could if you could define the areas of topics you could start I mean you have all that data you could see how long topics last and then and then you you probably work out what and you can start thinking about what yeah</u>
<u n="3097" who="S0192">yeah definitely depending on do topics last longer if there's only two speakers rather than four?</u>
<u n="3098" who="S0234">well yeah</u>
<u n="3099" who="S0192">is there topics move around quicker? like this kind of stuff I don't know they do all this when there's two different conversations going on that must be a bit difficult but erm I'm hoping that you know by the time it comes round to writing my dissertation I'm gonna have hundreds of hours of recording at that point so I'm hoping that I can do <unclear/> dissertation based on this somehow but I'm a bit worried that Cambridge have bought this material and I don't know whether they'll allow me to use it for my research</u>
<u n="3100" who="S0234">well if the if it's a public database</u>
<u n="3101" who="S0192">then it should be allowed so yeah</u>
<u n="3102" who="S0234">yeah you just have to write to them I'm sure I'm I'm fairly sure</u>
<u n="3103" who="S0192">I mean surely I can use my own recordings but I mean I guess I'm selling them to them so they become their property so I don't really know <pause dur="short"/> but erm</u>
<u n="3104" who="S0234">you just <trunc>chec</trunc> I mean presumably you've signed something</u>
<u n="3105" who="S0192">I've signed a contract I've got a freelance contract</u>
<u n="3106" who="S0234">yeah</u>
<u n="3107" who="S0192">I now have to it's annoying as well I have to be self assessed for taxes and stuff like that to do this job it's a little bit annoying</u>
<u n="3108" who="S0234">that so my my mum and dad are tax er they basically my dad works for so you know all this er er tax avoidance and</u>
<u n="3109" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="3110" who="S0234">evasion so one's right and one's not right he was basically he used to do that stuff for big companies which is kind of hilarious er that it's all like hit the news cos it's been going on for like <unclear/></u>
<u n="3111" who="S0192"><unclear>thousands</unclear></u>

<u n="3113" who="S0192">I haven't seen it on the news</u>
<u n="3114" who="S0234">oh okay so now it it came about because erm the biggest one that hit was Jimmy Carr</u>
<u n="3115" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="3116" who="S0234">erm basically offshoring his tax you know basically his money and actually a lot of entertainers so Gary Barlow happened a couple of weeks erm</u>
<u n="3117" who="S0192">I'm pretty terrible with celebrities I'm not gonna lie</u>
<u n="3118" who="S0234">well he was in Take That</u>
<u n="3119" who="S0192">okay oh right I thought he was in Coronation Street</u>
<u n="3120" who="S0234">no Gary no there may be a Barlow in Coronation Street <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3121" who="S0192" trans="overlap">is there a Barlow? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3122" who="S0234">but this is the lead <trunc>si</trunc> no one of the lead singers of Gary Barlow and then erm he <pause dur="short"/> was also in like the <trunc>tea</trunc> one of like the X Factor TV shows or something like that</u>
<u n="3123" who="S0198" trans="overlap">okay <unclear/></u>
<u n="3124" who="S0233"><unclear/> yeah so he's from Nigeria but I'm not quite sure <unclear/> background I get a vibe from him that his dad's quite important like he is like mid forties but I think he comes from quite a</u>
<u n="3125" who="S0198">yeah well yeah <unclear/> important family</u>
<u n="3126" who="S0233">from Nigeria or wherever <unclear/> so lived in London for like you know the last twenty <unclear/> twenty years or whatever <unclear/> speaks with a very precise <unclear/> articulated but then he's got one <unclear/> West African <unclear/> very interesting voice</u>
<u n="3127" who="S0198">yeah yeah <unclear/> some examples of that actually <unclear/> cos in Korea <unclear/> just walking around went into <unclear/> shop across the Rochester bridge go buy my spices <unclear/>I like English <unclear/> such a thick accent <unclear/> but the guy behind the counter he was Indian but he spoke with a very well pronounced much better than <unclear/> but it was funny watching him interact with <unclear/></u>
<u n="3128" who="S0233">but it's really <unclear/> accent and things like that because <unclear/> I mean I don't know how I spoke before I went to university</u>
<u n="3129" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="3130" who="S0233">but it's changed has changed <unclear/></u>
<u n="3131" who="S0198">yeah  I I think <unclear/> I don't think I went home</u>
<u n="3132" who="S0233">cos <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> to me they talk like like <unclear/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> switches <unclear/></u>

<u n="3135" who="S0198">I think she does I agree <unclear/></u>
<u n="3136" who="S0233">I think maybe she does also because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <unclear/> her voice because if she has to speak French <unclear/></u>
<u n="3137" who="S0198">no exactly so I think she's probably come from a position <unclear/> she probably over <trunc>comp</trunc> accommodates for her or whatever situation that she's in which in like the last ten years <unclear/> has been Medway and also yeah she's probably the most <unclear>conscious</unclear>  <unclear/> she spoke French and stuff <unclear/> so her and her sister <unclear/> she said her brother <unclear/> yeah and <unclear/> speak French I think that's great to be bilingual I think that's really awesome <unclear/> to have</u>
<u n="3138" who="S0233">the <unclear/> is Medway</u>
<u n="3139" who="S0198"><unclear/> when I it down with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> or <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <unclear/> I saw them the last time</u>
<u n="3140" who="S0233">well yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="3141" who="S0198">I was I was like what? and also when I went out with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <unclear/> her sister <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s got a really thick accent too we met up with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <unclear/> and his partner's having <unclear/> so sometimes I'm just like <unclear/></u>
<u n="3142" who="S0233">and I I I think Medway accent is actually <unclear/> it's not like er Essex</u>
<u n="3143" who="S0198">no no it's not quite the same as Essex and it's not a lot of people <unclear/> aren't they? <unclear/> it's not the same as <unclear/> yeah yeah <unclear/> yeah accents <unclear>don't really</unclear> change</u>
<u n="3144" who="S0233">so consequently it means if I ever go back to Medway I just kind of <unclear/> well I don't know I don't <unclear/> Medway accent I actually find it more <unclear/> perception to me <unclear/> the really posh <unclear/></u>
<u n="3145" who="S0198">yeah yeah yeah it's the way they treat you I got that a little bit <unclear/> they knew who I was but <unclear/> it's like you don't sound right I'm sorry I'm trying to but when erm when I've <unclear/> moving van <unclear/>it was interesting listening to myself then and listening to myself when I was with my mum and my dad cos I definitely spoke I accommodated much more for the <unclear/> dad yeah <unclear/> do it all the time <unclear/> well not everyone does it <unclear/> speak well <unclear/> conscious about it</u>

<u n="3168" who="S0234">yeah</u>
<u n="3169" who="S0192">yeah where you give your CDs for pittance</u>
<u n="3170" who="S0234">yeah</u>

<u n="3173" who="S0192">I've got about four or five hundred CDs and I was thinking brilliant don't need them anymore I'll sell them I came to have a look on the internet on Amazon for these companies and this is what I would consider a not viable company in today's society there's this company called Zoverstocks they will undercut anybody selling a CD second hand by a penny they just have an automatic piece of software that just undercuts everyone to the point where they're pretty much selling you know ninety percent of CDs like popular CDs for a penny and they're making their money off the postage but the way I think about this and they turn over about three million a year off or four million a year something like that and I've just got this feeling like if I have to physically send through the post my disc to you you then pay thirty P then you have to send through the post that disc to somebody else you're not making any money any profit off the CD you're simply making about fifty pence to a pound off the postage for you to make fifty pence or a pound this vehicle has to drive to wherever and then away from wherever to make two or three million pounds you're you're effectively doing eight million journeys around the country just to make a <trunc>fe</trunc> it's not a viable business model there's too much waste of resources for how much profit you're making in my opinion those kind of businesses shouldn't exist you're not making enough money</u>
<u n="3174" who="S0234">but but they are making money</u>
<u n="3175" who="S0192">they're making but if you think if it's if your model is that this product has to be driven to London and then driven to Newcastle</u>
<u n="3176" who="S0234" trans="overlap">but hang</u>
<u n="3177" who="S0192">and you make fifty pence</u>
<u n="3178" who="S0234">yeah</u>
<u n="3179" who="S0192">so you have to have millions of these to pay for your company that means that that car is driving around the UK millions of times just so that you can make a million pounds just seems detrimental to society to me</u>
<u n="3180" who="S0234">oh of course it's detrimental to society but if you're making money you can't stop people</u>
<u n="3181" who="S0192" trans="overlap">well of course in the capitalist model you'd say well the sky's the limit</u>
<u n="3182" who="S0234"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3183" who="S0192">but I I guess what I'm saying is I'm against that kind of business model</u>
<u n="3184" who="S0234">yeah oh no that's</u>
<u n="3185" who="S0192">I think and some way Korea works where England doesn't is they still have services they still have businesses that are basically non profit that are they view them more as services when you go to a bank in England you want a new card you'll probably queue up at the cashier they'll then tell you sorry we can't deal with this here you need to go and use that phone on the wall so then you go and ring the phone and then they tell you you'll get a new card through the post in a week or two in Korea you get the card made for you right there and then in front of you they do it yeah or there's water in there they'll give you biscuits and food there's certain things are treated like a service still</u>
<u n="3186" who="S0234">oh yeah but</u>
<u n="3187" who="S0192" trans="overlap">banking is still a service there</u>
<u n="3188" who="S0234">oh banking has changed a little bit maybe since if</u>
<u n="3189" who="S0192">maybe it has I haven't been banking <unclear/> in years</u>
<u n="3190" who="S0234">and also the post office has started to do this thing where instead of going to a counter you get like a number and you can go and sit and they'll bring you tea</u>
<u n="3191" who="S0192">oh nice</u>
<u n="3192" who="S0234">and all this kind of stuff and then you go up to a counter and then you sort your things out and then you you're done</u>
<event desc="begin overlap"/>
<u n="3193" who="S0192">so that service has come I guess what I'm saying on the broader scheme is you know education transportation utilities these things shouldn't be profit organisations</u>
<u n="3194" who="S0234">oh yeah I mean I have big problems with with <unclear/></u>
<u n="3195" who="S0192" trans="overlap">if you took that profit and let's just use public transport <unclear/> as an example if you took that profit and said that all of that profit must go into reducing the cost of tickets improving your services paying you <trunc>com</trunc> staff more just make these non profit organisations I mean of course they're privatised now so it's not gonna happen but</u>
<u n="3196" who="S0234">I know my big I I I am like I just really wish that transport was not a private you know organisation</u>
<u n="3197" who="S0192">transport in this country is bonkers completely bonkers</u>
<u n="3198" who="S0234">like</u>
<u n="3199" who="S0192">like National Express if you live anywhere within the gravity of London then your National Express vehicle is gonna stop in London for about three or four hours so if I wanna go from Brighton to Canterbury which should be about an hour to an hour and a half on a bus it's gonna take six hours and it's gonna drive to Heathrow and then stop for three hours and then drive on back and it does that with everything we wanted to get from Bath to Birmingham it's only about an hour and a half up this road you know but you have to go through London wait at Heathrow I mean it's just ludicrous it's really easy in Korea public transportation there is good like it's a good service it's I think one of the best things about Korea is how reasonable the country costs they pay quite well but like you wanna traverse the country you're talking a biggest <trunc>jour</trunc> a biggest journey's maybe six seven hours across the <trunc>coun</trunc> <vocal desc="misc"/> excuse me across the country you're gonna look at paying no more than ten fifteen pounds for a ticket on a bus things are affordable you wanna eat out it's always three pounds or six pounds</u>

<event desc="end overlap"/>
<u n="3211" who="S0234">yeah the only problem with with I mean it's weird right was happens especially in the UK is that so all of these things involve people that you've gotta employ</u>

<u n="3216" who="S0192">no no</u>
<u n="3217" who="S0234">so living <trunc>wa</trunc> like it's a weird circle of you know issue</u>
<u n="3218" who="S0192">I I think Americans are actually doing quite well I don't know if just the demographic of Americans that we meet in America is more middle class? but it seems to me that they come from more affluent families their families have more land</u>

<u n="3222" who="S0192">but then ask them how much they earn like their earnings are equitable if not slightly more than what my family are on in England you know what I mean? my dad has been a civil engineer for years he's probably on about twenty-two K my mother works for the government works in the borough she's probably on about eighteen grand a year and I speak to my America friends teachers get paid more there and this kind of stuff but yet the cost of living is lower and even when you include healthcare I mean we pay through the nose for healthcare we do pay for it we think it's free but we pay pretty sure if you add up all the taxes in this country we pay about fifty percent in tax if you add VAT twenty percent on everything we purchase</u>

<u n="3253" who="S0234" trans="overlap">yeah yeah that's that's</u>
<u n="3254" who="S0198">cos they don't actually they don't create very much council accommodation that isn't a two or three bed house</u>
<u n="3255" who="S0234">that's that's that's the problem that</u>
<u n="3256" who="S0198">that's cos they're creating it for families so there is a problem</u>

<u n="3261" who="S0198">it's just based on a spare bedroom</u>

<u n="3295" who="S0234" trans="overlap">yeah the problem is the problem is there's a different yeah</u>
<u n="3296" who="S0233" trans="overlap">support people moving so what you're actually doing is just penalising people for their situation</u>
<u n="3297" who="S0234">but but it's well known that money the best way to do anything is to to use money so for example stopping people stopping the population from smoking you tax cigarettes it's work it's proven to work</u>
<u n="3298" who="S0192">do you think that's the best way?</u>
<u n="3299" who="S0198">they're doing a combination of things right now</u>

<u n="3305" who="S0192">I don't know if I agree with that? so tobacco companies or whoever is still making just as much money off these things only people are paying more for less</u>
<u n="3306" who="S0198">in in America in Tennessee</u>
<u n="3307" who="S0234" trans="overlap">yeah but it stops so it stops so ah basically if people can't afford to do it they generally stop it and they and if they see that it's a money is a big driver in people's philosophy everywhere</u>

<u n="3309" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah thing is a lot of poor people still smoking</u>
<u n="3310" who="S0192">but erm</u>
<u n="3311" who="S0234">yeah the problem the problem with what what it causes</u>
<u n="3312" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it just means that they're paying more for what they're smoking they're paying more for what they're drinking</u>
<u n="3313" who="S0198">I think less people starting to smoke that's definitely working</u>
<u n="3314" who="S0192">erm I think</u>
