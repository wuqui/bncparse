<u n="1174" who="S0144">that confused the hell out of me</u>
<u n="1175" who="S0024">well at least you did something good with them of the</u>
<u n="1176" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0024">I I don't why haven't why hasn't that been changed? surely people complained about that question</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0024" trans="overlap">last term?</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0024">you you've got to say well the noun phrase okay the question is asking you what the known phrase is after the verb and what the head noun is <pause dur="short"/> if I'm walking around it looks like you've written what the head noun is or the first <pause dur="short"/> the noun phrase before the verb which is the one that's corresponding to the verb so it's just why isn't it questioning there? and they've all done it so you can't get out of it they all did it wrong <pause dur="short"/> they all go the verb the noun the head noun that went with the verb because the question's kind of like asking you what's the main verb</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0024">and then what's the head noun? <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0024">it's a stupid stupid stupid question <pause dur="short"/> but nobody else seems to be bothered by it none of the other lecturers</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0144">no <pause dur="short"/> I I still don't get it <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> so the first one was saying what's the head noun of the noun phrase?</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0144">after the verb?</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="1190" who="S0144">yeah?</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0144">although that shouldn't technically be called the head noun</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0144">well it's the head noun</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0024" trans="overlap">it's</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0144" trans="overlap">of that phrase</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0024">of that phrase</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0144">and that's it?</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0144">not</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1202" who="S0144">of the sentence of that phrase?</u>
<u n="1203" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="1204" who="S0144">so they do all that thinking okay that's the rule and then they turn the page and say actually</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0024">actually you need to look at the other noun <trunc>ques</trunc></u>
<u n="1206" who="S0144" trans="overlap">look there's another noun here before the verb <vocal desc="laugh"/> this is the head noun</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0024">that corresponds with the verb</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0024">that corresponds with the verb so do all the other nouns not correspond with the verb?</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0024">which nouns? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1210" who="S0144">well the ones on the <trunc>fir</trunc> first page</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0024">the first page no they don't match</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0144">they don't match with the verb</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0024">they don't match with the verb because they go with the other nouns that come after the verb</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0144">so the head noun is always before?</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0024" trans="overlap"><unclear/> no I dunno that's the head <pause dur="short"/> noun of the noun phrase after the verb</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1217" who="S0024">but the question looks like you're looking at the verb and you're looking at the noun and they they're looking at the head noun like the the noun that corresponds to the verb for the whole sentence</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0024"><trunc>becau</trunc> but because oh because that make sense</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0024">but you've got to stand there in class and say well actually this question doesn't really make that much sense what some of you have put this this and this and I wrote up <pause dur="short"/> by the verbs okay what some of them had</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0024" trans="overlap">put for the head noun in the first of the noun phrase it's stupid</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0024">and they're all just sat there with their mouths open and went oh okay and then we had to move on because I'm I couldn't explain it</u>
