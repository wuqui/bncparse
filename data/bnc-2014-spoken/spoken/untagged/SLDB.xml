<u n="35" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I just I don't understand the logic behind it</u>

<u n="39" who="S0041">skinny weirdo yeah <pause dur="short"/> like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and crazy horse is one thing to contend with but the whole motley crew</u>
<u n="40" who="S0086">yeah and then that weird one that was with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> for a while and the fat one <pause dur="short"/> that was who we though <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was wasn't it?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> no it's just all too it's all too much <pause dur="short"/> to be honest I'd rather just go over the Village for a few drinks and then come into town</u>
<u n="42" who="S0086">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well that's the thing it's your prerogative it's your birthday <pause dur="short"/> that's what you get to do <pause dur="short"/> you get to do you get to choose you don't get to be told by your housemate <pause dur="short"/> you've got to have a chavtastic barbecue and like it</u>
<u n="43" who="S0041">fucking <unclear/></u>

<u n="45" who="S0041">to be honest I'd rather have her back than bloody</u>
<u n="46" who="S0086">noisy feet</u>
<u n="47" who="S0041">noisy feet upstairs <pause dur="short"/> what I was thinking actually is that they've <trunc>sta</trunc> we've started doing packages at the hotel for cocktail making <pause dur="short"/> and we go and it'll be <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> that does it basically teaches you how to make a cocktail</u>
<u n="48" who="S0086">fun</u>
<u n="49" who="S0041">and then or teaches you how to make two cocktails and then he gives you loads of ingredients and splits you into two teams and you have to make your own cocktail and then he judges the winner and whatever one wins is the cocktail of the week at the hotel</u>
<u n="50" who="S0086">wow that's such a good idea</u>
<u n="51" who="S0041">yeah and I think  I think  it's like twelve pound a head for one to have one cocktail each out of it or twenty pound head to have two cocktails reach out of it <pause dur="short"/> but we pay half price anyway</u>
<u n="52" who="S0086">winner</u>
<u n="53" who="S0041">Cos I get fifty per cent off at the hotel don't I?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0086">that sounds like a bargain? Does that extend to your friends?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0041">yeah I think I'd book it and pay for the lot</u>
<u n="56" who="S0086">oh right</u>
<u n="57" who="S0041">so as far as they're concerned I pay for everything</u>
<u n="58" who="S0086">it's all on your bill it's your bill</u>
<u n="59" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="60" who="S0086">ah well that sounds pretty exciting</u>
<u n="61" who="S0041">so that would be fun thing to do</u>
<u n="62" who="S0086">yeah it sounds really fun even if it is at work it's whether you want to spend your birthday at work but even</u>
<u n="63" who="S0041">yeah but we'd only be there for an hour or two</u>
<u n="64" who="S0086">yeah and then you're well placed you know for carrying o the festivities</u>
<u n="65" who="S0041">yeah so I thought that would be fun</u>
<u n="66" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0041">something easy you know when I don't <pause dur="short"/> it's easily done it's not expensive and then</u>
<u n="68" who="S0086">yeah and then <pause dur="short"/> and then you know cocktails Aare always nice <pause dur="short"/> see where the night takes us <pause dur="short"/> I can't believe how soon it's come in</u>

Yeah the covers yeah well mm I'll get them to you <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> like he has he's done loads of work for me hasn't sent in any invoices <pause dur="short"/> I don't know how he actually lives <pause dur="short"/> he never remembers to actually request for payment <pause dur="short"/> so I was em I was briefing him to do some more work and I called <pause dur="short"/> he I'd sent him an email he'd called me to like to clarify a few points and he said did you have a good long break over Easter? And I said yeah it was you know really fun quite relaxing how was yours?

<u n="126" who="S0041">you don't tell someone you work with that</u>
<u n="127" who="S0086">no or work for which is even worse</u>

<u n="131" who="S0086">Cos I told <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> our designer who is you know know him much better than I do <pause dur="short"/> because normally it should fall to them to do the briefing but <pause dur="short"/> funnily enough they said oh we're really busy <pause dur="short"/> can you do it?

<u n="356" who="S0041">he's like right okay and I said em and then obviously there'll be twelve week intensive training then after that it'll be more leadership based <pause dur="short"/> so I just have to get through the twelve week power on through cry every day</u>

<u n="386" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> officers are all together ratings are all together but obviously you can't be an officer unless you've done you're A-levels so although you would be eighteen the likely hood of anybody that's eighteen years old getting throughout interview bit at the end is very unlikely <pause dur="short"/> they'd probably minimum age twenty</u>
<u n="387" who="S0086">oh good okay</u>
<u n="388" who="S0041">so that's a bit more</u>

<u n="403" who="S0086">I mean you say this now but I think you've forgotten how fucking cold it is when it's minus one <pause dur="short"/> so you might really want to be parading round in your bikini but em no <pause dur="short"/> you might actually you might actually be blue yourself from hypothermia so</u>
<u n="404" who="S0041">match the hat</u>

<u n="434" who="S0041">A bit mental <pause dur="short"/> secret squirrel things</u>
<u n="435" who="S0086" trans="overlap">nobody would go and talk to them cos they do their own secret thing so <unclear/> no one really understands that but it's fine</u>

<u n="447" who="S0086">yeah I don't know what he looks like <pause dur="short"/> I don't think he I wouldn't work with me <pause dur="short"/> but obviously there's a thousand people on site so</u>
<u n="448" who="S0041">well yeah that's what I mean <pause dur="short"/> I see the name and I think ooh Liz might know him and I think how the fucks that going to happen</u>
<u n="449" who="S0086">definitely going to look him up in connections tomorrow <pause dur="short"/> but em so they restructured this restructure about six months ago <pause dur="short"/> and em and obviously now we we're now in in the new restructure <pause dur="short"/> and one of them has been headhunted y the head of <trunc>in</trunc> you know <anon type="place"/> it's like an alternative to A-level <pause dur="short"/> has been head hunted to be the head of <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> she's going to go and work in <anon type="place"/> but she's going to you know</u>
<u n="450" who="S0041">what the fuck? Seriously?</u>
<u n="451" who="S0086">yeah yeah she's going to go and</u>
<u n="452" who="S0041">how the hell did that happen?</u>
<u n="453" who="S0086">create their publishing program in relation to the curriculum <pause dur="short"/> its fucking <trunc>men</trunc> she's going to be on ridiculous money <pause dur="short"/> but she's only just been appointed as this head of em school book publishing literally a matter of months ago <pause dur="short"/> so I read the I actually read this announcement one of the few that I actually do</u>
<u n="454" who="S0041">which you hadn't deleted</u>
<u n="455" who="S0086">yeah yeah cos everyone was like have you heard <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s leaving I was like no hang on wait a minute let me get go through my trash <pause dur="short"/> em and they said yeah she's you know she's been recruited to be head of whatever and we're all very excited blah de blah <pause dur="short"/> okay wow it's amazing <pause dur="short"/> speaking to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> it turns out the they that she works in education and I work in ELT that their head of education was headhunted first <pause dur="short"/> she turned it down but said to her boss like the director I've been headhunted I want a better position and I want more money and they went okay oh my god right stay and we'll create this new  this new  role for you which was announced last week and now I know why because that that was her bargaining chip <pause dur="short"/> cos she was the one who was actually headhunted <pause dur="short"/> she turned it down <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she turned it down and now <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s got it <pause dur="short"/> but it's so good because I mean it's a <trunc>n</trunc> it's a fantastic opportunity for anybody to be em headhunted at that level but it's a woman <pause dur="short"/> like it's a female <pause dur="short"/> it's really good <pause dur="short"/> it's really really good <pause dur="short"/> cos even though publishing is a  is a  real female orientated industry the top jobs are still blokes</u>
<u n="456" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's the same in any industry isn't it? I know it sound really old fashioned but it's true <pause dur="short"/> you hot a certain level and then it's male dominated</u>
<u n="457" who="S0086">well it's disgusting and it shouldn't be the case <pause dur="short"/> so it's nice it's refreshing actually cos even on our senior management team the majority positions are held by men <pause dur="short"/> and that's only middle management</u>
<u n="458" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="459" who="S0086">so yeah it's really it's difficult</u>
<u n="460" who="S0041">I think it's because men are  men are  easier at piggy backing <pause dur="short"/> I've said this for years <pause dur="short"/> a good manager a good CEO is a good piggy backer <pause dur="short"/> they're not good at anything themselves but they're god a seeing who's good at the stuff and using people</u>
<u n="461" who="S0086">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="462" who="S0041">and I think women and less incline to do that</u>
<u n="463" who="S0086">yeah well you you sort of you take a lot of responsibility on your own shoulders I think that's she difficulty</u>
<u n="464" who="S0041">or if you're in a team you want to work with the team not use the team <pause dur="short"/> and I think once you get to a certain level you've got to be able to extract yourself from it</u>
<u n="465" who="S0086">yeah yeah yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="466" who="S0041">and see even above the top line <pause dur="short"/> like my dad was saying and I was debating going in as an officer or a rating I was like I don't really want to I want to be invoked with people <pause dur="short"/> and he was like no no no do you want to be giving the orders or taking the orders <pause dur="short"/> and I was like yeah but it'll be your whole if cos you'll be there all the time <pause dur="short"/> there's no going home from work <pause dur="short"/> and he was like yeah but you're still going to have friends there <pause dur="short"/> they'll just be on a similar level to you <pause dur="short"/> and I said but like he said well I never went home did I? I was on the side I said but were you friends with them? He said no <pause dur="short"/> I said well there you go I want friendships out of it <pause dur="short"/> and he said well I still go out with them but they're more acquaintances <pause dur="short"/> and for him it was very easy and it always has been he's always down the same job <pause dur="short"/> that</u>
<u n="467" who="S0086">he could draw a line</u>
<u n="468" who="S0041">yeah and I think  I think  girls naturally find it more difficult cos you don't <pause dur="short"/> I think girls like to please each other more than man do</u>
<u n="469" who="S0086">yeah yeah absolutely <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah or or you find that you get <pause dur="short"/> I think that's the problem that women then try and adopt male attributes in order to progress <pause dur="short"/> and they're either seen as ah you know she's being a cow or <pause dur="short"/> women get it slightly wrong or they go a bit you know or they just delegate everything and they just piss on their thrones <pause dur="short"/> we like one of our directors is female and she's just a massive twat she doesn't do anything she just delegated everything and the everyone ends up really stressed and motivated as opposed to feeling empowered to do stuff because they're being utilised for their articular skill set <pause dur="short"/> they're not there just becoming digs bodies <pause dur="short"/> de-skilled and demotivated so</u>
<u n="470" who="S0041">oh my god <pause dur="short"/> so today I went on the em website for the company I used to work for</u>
<u n="471" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="472" who="S0041">and before I left I was trying to encourage him to retain to work on his retention but he just he don't <pause dur="short"/> he wanted to do it but he just never really implemented it <pause dur="short"/> and I said well I'm doing all this marketing I need a bigger marketing base <pause dur="short"/> so every time somebody asks for a quote I should have their details I should have their at least their email address whack on marketing list <pause dur="short"/> I said cos as long as it's relevant to them then we're not spamming them</u>
<u n="473" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="474" who="S0041">he's like yeah okay so we should do that and then I said okay encouraging people even just to leave their information if I put if I write some things to go on like a guide to  a guide to  translation or guide to search engine optimisation but in a foreign language <pause dur="short"/> even if it's just like a little bit of information for people that have never done it before <pause dur="short"/> so just like side of A four which some things some people already know <pause dur="short"/> but people don't know about like the software that automatically translates stuff like translation memory <pause dur="short"/> people don't know whether tis <pause dur="short"/> you assume they do cos we've been in this field for a long time <pause dur="short"/> and he's been in it for like twenty years</u>
<u n="475" who="S0086">yeah</u>
<u n="476" who="S0041">well usually people don't know that exists <pause dur="short"/> every time you send something to a translator they put it through a machine basically that remembers <pause dur="short"/> it breaks down the sentences in smaller chunks and remembers it <pause dur="short"/> so if one time you translate and there was and it comes up later as you start to write it auto-populates it and you can see and click yes or no <pause dur="short"/> which is great because especially if you work for say Microsoft and you get stuff from them every month the way they phrase things their terminology is going to repeated through everything they do <pause dur="short"/> it's quicker for you to click yes than it is to translate it <pause dur="short"/> so it speeds it up it makes it more accurate and more consistent and therefore more cost effective <pause dur="short"/> cos you don't get charged for the repetition</u>
<u n="477" who="S0086">okay</u>
<u n="478" who="S0041">they charge you I think it's like five per cent of the unit price for any words that are repeated <pause dur="short"/> so in layman's terms it takes a long time to explain and he didn't really get it but I was telling people and they were like ah <pause dur="short"/> what's that then? I was like you know like in Word when you write the date you write the first two letters and it <trunc>ci</trunc> brings it up and you can put yes or onto <pause dur="short"/> that's basically it <pause dur="short"/> em so I wrote three three different things for him <pause dur="short"/> I said if we put them on the website people want to click to download their free information on whatever it is <pause dur="short"/> and then in order to download it you ask for their email <pause dur="short"/> cos they're getting something cos they're getting free information and we're getting something cos we get their email went on the fucking website today <pause dur="short"/> leven's top tips for something or other <pause dur="short"/> my fucking writing</u>

<u n="665" who="S0086">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I had I collapsed between each one <pause dur="short"/> cos he was like just dig <pause dur="short"/> and actually what he was saying was quite a good tip that I'd never hear was dig your toes in <pause dur="short"/> if you dig your toes in you've got a you've got something to help you up with <pause dur="short"/> because before I was like how do you or I don't have any upper arm strength so I just can't do it <pause dur="short"/> and what I found was I was always dropping my bum which is why I have trouble swimming I think <pause dur="short"/> I drop my bum rather than be like a plank rather than to be up down up down it would be more like that <pause dur="short"/> so I'd kind of go up as one and then drop and then down so it would be a bit <pause dur="short"/> it was never really even</u>
<u n="666" who="S0041">I really want to try aprÃ¨s up but I'm a bit scared now</u>
<u n="667" who="S0086">it's really not a fun time  It's really not a fun time  so tats' why tomorrow I have to go running cos I didn't really do any cardio yesterday <pause dur="short"/> just went to bloody fishing game which is shit by the way</u>
<u n="668" who="S0041">fishing game? Ah</u>
<u n="669" who="S0086">on the rowing <pause dur="short"/> I always kept getting eaten <pause dur="short"/> big fish always came to eat me</u>
<u n="670" who="S0041">hang on a second you actually have a game</u>
<u n="671" who="S0086">on the rowing machine it's called go fish</u>
<u n="672" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="673" who="S0086">you'd think it would be really fun but it's shit</u>
<u n="674" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="675" who="S0086">basically what happens is the more the <trunc>ho</trunc> in theory what happens <pause dur="short"/> the harder you row your fish starts off at the bottom and there are little fish that are smaller than you that you get to eat to accrue points <pause dur="short"/> but there's big fish that will eat you and then you die and then you lose points and depending on how fast you row you move up and down the the space on the screen <pause dur="short"/> so if there's big fish at the top you want to kind of slow it down so you fall back down the screen and then you get to eat the little fish <pause dur="short"/> but then there's a big fish coming out the bottom <pause dur="short"/> you've got to speed up sp that's you're on the top in theory <pause dur="short"/> but even when you're going rowing like a fucking maniac you're not moving very quickly so you just get really annoyed co then you get eaten</u>
<u n="676" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="677" who="S0086">but I it's quite it takes your mind off the fact that you're rowing cos that's fucking boring let's be honest <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="678" who="S0041">yeah I don't have that game</u>
<u n="679" who="S0086">it's a really good work out</u>
<u n="680" who="S0041">I really want to see if I can do a boy press up <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I can</u>
<u n="681" who="S0086">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> I think I might actually die if I tried to do one <pause dur="short"/> I'll try and do one in a minute when I've eaten my from you <pause dur="short"/> but today man alive <pause dur="short"/> I tried to get out of bed and I went ah <pause dur="short"/> cos he was getting me to do ones for my top abs and one for my lower abs or something</u>
<u n="682" who="S0041">what did this entail <pause dur="short"/> that's what I think I need an abs workout</u>
<u n="683" who="S0086">it was quite good actually it was em <pause dur="short"/> sit ups and we've got one of those ones where it hold your feet but you have to you're lying down so so gravity is sort of working against you so you have to work harder <pause dur="short"/> but it means that your feet are are trapped so it makes it that bit easier in a way so it's <pause dur="short"/> it's a bit weird but I I don't really like doing those <pause dur="short"/> I can only do like three sets of fifteen on that <pause dur="short"/> and the we did ones one the mat but with em like a kettle bell and you've got to move your body from side to side as you sit up</u>
<u n="684" who="S0041">ah yeah</u>
<u n="685" who="S0086">and that was  that was quite good actually <pause dur="short"/> I found that having something in my hands actually made it easier</u>
<u n="686" who="S0041">ah</u>
<u n="687" who="S0086">like as a sort of way to motivate your body to get up <pause dur="short"/> having this weight and then like put it down on the mat so that you're moving your whole body <pause dur="short"/> cos what he's like you're moving your legs <pause dur="short"/> you're cheating <pause dur="short"/> you're <trunc>ch</trunc> you're still you're cheating now <pause dur="short"/> so he came and sat on my feet which helped <pause dur="short"/> it was put if you put it down on the mat you actually really make your body move <pause dur="short"/> so <unclear/> come and go mm yeah this is fine <pause dur="short"/> he's he was like yeah but your' doing it wring <pause dur="short"/> okay fine</u>
<u n="688" who="S0041">damn <pause dur="short"/> it</u>
<u n="689" who="S0086">yeah and then there was all kind of press ups occurring made want to cry</u>
<u n="690" who="S0041">really want to try it really bad <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I can do it through</u>
<u n="691" who="S0086">mm <pause dur="short"/> what he was saying he's got some pads for kickboxing I was like I really like kickboxing from when I went before <pause dur="short"/> he's like well I could take you and try it out for weekend for kickboxing</u>
<u n="692" who="S0041">that sounds fun</u>
<u n="693" who="S0086">which would be really fun <pause dur="short"/> cos when we use to go the guy used to make us like run up and down the room and like do lunges and kick really fast and it was really fast paid and I remember when I used to come home I was really buzzing <pause dur="short"/> I felt so energetic ad so just really buzzing like really pumped <pause dur="short"/> and even when I have like a workout now you know when you're having good run you sort of feel like yeah I could keep going I feel really good and then then you die</u>
<u n="694" who="S0041">well yeah of course</u>
<u n="695" who="S0086">I think like having that the difference with that was just doing yourself and having a class with that person there to motivate you <pause dur="short"/> it really really helps <pause dur="short"/> it's quite nice when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s there cos I just have a bit of a laugh <pause dur="short"/> like every time I laugh he makes me do more so I try not to laugh <pause dur="short"/> cos he's a bastard <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> but he does make me laugh so</u>
<u n="696" who="S0041">sounds fun <pause dur="short"/> yeah to be honest it was really nice having Nick there today <pause dur="short"/> I realised that I would never want to go anywhere with anyone doing anything ever</u>
<u n="697" who="S0086">no</u>
<u n="698" who="S0041">no never ever</u>
<u n="699" who="S0086">I really would like a personal trainer</u>
<u n="700" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="701" who="S0086">so expensive though</u>
<u n="702" who="S0041">yeah if I could afford it I would certainly have personal trainer all the time</u>
<u n="703" who="S0086">mm definitely <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="704" who="S0041">I'd love that</u>
<u n="705" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="706" who="S0041">hey ho <pause dur="short"/> I was thinking I've made no plans for the weekend actually <pause dur="short"/> I quite like it that way <pause dur="short"/> to be honest</u>
<u n="707" who="S0086">yeah <pause dur="short"/> especially when living in a budget</u>
<u n="708" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="709" who="S0086">mm</u>
<u n="710" who="S0041">sounds like a granny but I'm really looking forward to sleep tonight <pause dur="short"/> I feel like I've not really slept properly for ages <pause dur="short"/> it's like Kate's been getting me up for doing or <pause dur="short"/> I had a lie in at the weekend and it didn't feel good enough</u>
<u n="711" who="S0086">I woke up I think it must have been <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s boyfriend rattling the bike chains at five o'clock this morning <pause dur="short"/> if he's got to leave at that time then I just don't understand why he has to stay <pause dur="short"/> I mean to be fair I haven't heard him for ages but <pause dur="short"/> it's not and he was I could tell he was trying to be quiet but really <pause dur="short"/> I just think if you're going to be leaving at five why stay?</u>
<u n="712" who="S0041">the thing that I don't understand is that he's an adult <pause dur="short"/> you're not a teenager you know <pause dur="short"/> you're not  You're not  a young person being a little bit selfish <pause dur="short"/> you're a fifty year old bloke <pause dur="short"/> have some self-respect</u>
<u n="713" who="S0086">yeah it's weird</u>
<u n="714" who="S0041">you would never I don't know any man that would knowingly wake up a household <pause dur="short"/> I just don't I mean I just don't know those people <pause dur="short"/> being quiet or not I mean it's just so so childish tapping around like that you just wouldn't degrade yourself in that way <pause dur="short"/> just have some dignity <pause dur="short"/> you're a fully you you're a fully grown man <pause dur="short"/> behave like one</u>
<u n="715" who="S0086">it was like when we <pause dur="short"/> when we had the argument with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> he just sloped of upstairs didn't he?</u>
<u n="716" who="S0041">yeah god you'd be so embarrassed if that was your boyfriend or whatever wouldn't you and he behaved like that</u>
<u n="717" who="S0086">horrendous <pause dur="short"/> like I barely speak to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> these days</u>
<u n="718" who="S0041">no me neither <pause dur="short"/> she was in here earlier and she barely looked up</u>
<u n="719" who="S0086">I just don't really have anything to say to her <pause dur="short"/> it was nice at she took Craig that dinner though</u>
<u n="720" who="S0041">yeah yeah I didn't expect hat</u>
<u n="721" who="S0086">it was really nice but em <pause dur="short"/> I'm just thinking it I appreciate that he's really making an effort to be quiet but I you have it's always hoping to wake us up <pause dur="short"/> cos it's a relay the walls are really thin and the bokes are noisy and if you are owing to be getting up at that time just don't leave your bike out the front <pause dur="short"/> go out the back <pause dur="short"/> because I can hear <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> in the kitchen <pause dur="short"/> she was up <pause dur="short"/> and that's what fucks you off like why do we wake up just because your boyfriend's staying and</u>
<u n="722" who="S0041">no it's just no</u>
<u n="723" who="S0086">and that's cos we're living on top of each other <pause dur="short"/> you know there's a lot of people in a house that was only really designed for three so <pause dur="short"/> it's hard</u>
<u n="724" who="S0041">yeah it drives me frigging nuts</u>
<u n="725" who="S0086">I'm not particularly careful <pause dur="short"/> like when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s round now not the he ever really stays the night but <pause dur="short"/> bertie beg your pardon <pause dur="short"/> just think <pause dur="short"/> I don't really I worry about his noise levels</u>
<u n="726" who="S0041">I never hear him never hear him</u>
<u n="727" who="S0086">really</u>
<u n="728" who="S0041">never have once heard him at all</u>
<u n="729" who="S0086">that's good <pause dur="short"/> I usually do tell him off in the mornings if he is here because he doesn't have an inside voice <pause dur="short"/> but I notice that <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> doesn't either cos when we got back from</u>
<u n="730" who="S0041"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> doesn't</u>
<u n="731" who="S0086">it's weird <pause dur="short"/> when we got back form <anon type="place"/> last Wednesday she was just talking like at this volume but it was one o'clock in the morning and everybody else obviously <unclear/> to talk quietly but no there was none of that <pause dur="short"/> so I was talking really like <vocal desc="misc"/> and show would just be carrying on as if <pause dur="short"/> she must have thought like why are you whispering <pause dur="short"/> or like she goes to the toilet and she doesn't turn the handle so she slams the door behind her and then slams it again when she comes out and leaves the light on <pause dur="short"/> she does it all the time she always leaves the light on <pause dur="short"/> I'm like em you've got to go in and turn the light on when you go in there <pause dur="short"/> we obviously always keep the light off <pause dur="short"/> it's just really the sort of thing that I can imagine <pause dur="short"/> her mum is really a stickler for stuff like that and I can see why her mum would get why they would get on each other's nerves cos the are polar opposites <pause dur="short"/> but then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I guess because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is really relaxed about stuff like that like it doesn't faze her <pause dur="short"/> she's just not bothered about it which is fine <pause dur="short"/> but for people who are a bit worried about you know either saving electricity or</u>
<u n="732" who="S0041">saving the planet</u>
<u n="733" who="S0086">saving the planet <pause dur="short"/> you know just I think that sort of passes her by <pause dur="short"/> and it's hard because she's so scattered like with her mum last Wednesday her mum was like have you got the tickets now are you sure you've got the tickets have you packed the tickets? Cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is really scattered she's like yeah mum fuck's sake I'm not a teenager <pause dur="short"/> it is the sort of thing she would do is get to mine of get to Norwich and realise she hasn't packed them</u>
<u n="734" who="S0041">she hasn't got them <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="735" who="S0086">so she did check like ten times though in her handbag <pause dur="short"/> and she actually made me check can you just check my handbag I've got the tickets I haven't <unclear/> them <pause dur="short"/> yeah no they're definitely there <pause dur="short"/> but it must be really infuriating for your mum not to trust you for your mum to treat you like a child because you are a bit scatty <pause dur="short"/> I think now she's so used to her own space it's the first time she's been living at home since she was what? Twenty-one <pause dur="short"/> so it is going to em it is going to take its toll <pause dur="short"/> even though my budget's shit I really want to go wild this weekend</u>
<u n="736" who="S0041">yep <pause dur="short"/> I definitely do</u>
<u n="737" who="S0086">I feel like we're overdue</u>
<u n="738" who="S0041">I feel like I'm I'm containing the crazy</u>
<u n="739" who="S0086">yeah I'm on the edge <pause dur="short"/> I think that's the problem with today I really feel like I need to have a big blow out</u>
<u n="740" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="741" who="S0086">and usually what happens when I feel like that is I get absolutely plastered by about eight thirty I've passed out in my own bed so <pause dur="short"/> so I am quite a cheap night out <pause dur="short"/> em but I guess your birthday's not so far away <pause dur="short"/> what is it the week after next?
