<u n="124" who="S0628">er it's about the government domestic counter terrorism policy</u>
<u n="125" who="S0624">okay</u>
<u n="126" who="S0628">but so it's really interesting it's just a bit it's quite <trunc>har</trunc> it's quite well trodden ground in a way I'm sort of looking at like the situation now and how it's evolved since the policy was first introduced but er mainly like policy stuff into the thing</u>
<u n="127" who="S0624" trans="overlap">so is that the prevent?</u>
<u n="128" who="S0628">prevent yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0628">and making of policies so <unclear/> harder then also like it's for an audience which is pretty the default position is like quite anti-religion so just being like</u>
<u n="131" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="132" who="S0628">this targets Muslims is not enough</u>
<u n="133" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0628">for that is you have to make the case more for <unclear/> and I think it's probably more interesting anyway to make</u>
<u n="135" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0628">making the case around like universal values and stuff</u>
<u n="137" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0628">about why it's bad</u>
<u n="139" who="S0624">about around universal values</u>
<u n="140" who="S0628" trans="overlap">so like freedom of speech</u>
<u n="141" who="S0624" trans="overlap">er yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0628">erm I mean like it has a <unclear/> effect for everyone</u>
<u n="143" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0628">but also and like governments the sort of ethics of a government like getting into</u>
<u n="145" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0628" trans="overlap"><trunc>ideo</trunc>ideological <unclear>battles</unclear></u>
<u n="147" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0628" trans="overlap">which is what they're doing quite specific</u>
<u n="149" who="S0624">as as opposed making sort of a culture argument about</u>
<u n="150" who="S0628" trans="overlap">well I</u>
<u n="151" who="S0624">protecting er</u>
<u n="152" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0628">protecting <unclear/></u>
<u n="155" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0628">or the er</u>
<u n="157" who="S0624">that is interesting it's interesting</u>
<u n="158" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="159" who="S0624">to have to like look on it from a different</u>
<u n="160" who="S0628">yeah it is interesting</u>
<u n="161" who="S0624" trans="overlap">different tack</u>
<u n="162" who="S0628" trans="overlap">I mean <unclear>let it affect it</unclear> too much but it just sort of was in my head a bit</u>
<u n="163" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0628">and also because it's been written about on like quite a lot so</u>
<u n="165" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0628">I thought it was a bit more interesting sort of like should a government be fighting ideas? which is what they've said they want to</u>
<u n="167" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0628">like what is that what are the implications of that?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0628">and are can are they any good at doing it? which they're not and erm</u>
<u n="171" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0628">so that what</u>
<u n="173" who="S0624" trans="overlap">that's so interesting</u>
<u n="174" who="S0628" trans="overlap">like yeah it was just <trunc>rea</trunc> it was really challenging to do and</u>
<u n="175" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah that's so that's like such a like that's such a like important question</u>
<u n="176" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0624">like I think like because it's like it's so like that thing is like so historically specific</u>
<u n="178" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="179" who="S0624">what the kind of like <unclear>laws</unclear> of like not being able to like think</u>
<u n="180" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0624" trans="overlap">and stuff like it's so and like you know like er like <unclear/> it's sort of like <unclear/> I guess and like</u>
<u n="182" who="S0628">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="183" who="S0624" trans="overlap">in <unclear/> like</u>
<u n="184" who="S0628" trans="overlap">it's very similar</u>
<u n="185" who="S0624" trans="overlap">and it's just the same sort of like</u>
<u n="186" who="S0628">it's exactly the same sort of thing and we've now got like a definition of extremism on <unclear>the statute</unclear></u>
<u n="187" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0628" trans="overlap"><unclear/> so it's not just that it's bad to be a terrorist or <unclear/></u>
<u n="189" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="190" who="S0628">it's just being an extremist is prohibited which is kind of edging towards</u>
<u n="191" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="192" who="S0628">criminalising people for opinions</u>
<u n="193" who="S0624">did you see that thing when they came out and they were talking about like the what they've advised schools to keep track on?</u>
<u n="194" who="S0628">yeah kids</u>

<u n="699" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="700" who="S0624">and there's just somebody paying for stuff and like in Spain I think I had a big argument with <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> about this actually cos in Spain like a culture of like cleaning</u>
<u n="701" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="702" who="S0624">like being a hotelier or like working in like</u>
<u n="703" who="S0628">yeah</u>

<u n="709" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah that's interesting</u>
<u n="710" who="S0624">but I think but I just like I strongly believe that some jobs are better than other jobs</u>
<u n="711" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="712" who="S0624">and like</u>
<u n="713" who="S0628">but I think also like some</u>

<u n="716" who="S0624" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="717" who="S0628">but I also I <trunc>ha</trunc> I struggled with this that I <trunc>th</trunc>thought about it for a lot because of being in Pakistan</u>

<u n="728" who="S0624" trans="overlap">employment</u>
<u n="729" who="S0628">but like the structure is fucked like the the fact that it's such a service economy is I think that's really bad but then at the same time those are really good desirable jobs for people to have</u>
<u n="730" who="S0624">yeah</u>

<u n="801" who="S0628">if everyone thinks like that then nothing ever happens it's quite a difficult what do you think? this is a completely different topic but kind of related like about about so you know how the like there's such a terrible housing crisis erm but I was talking to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> about this the other day that's why I thought of it like policies like help to buy or something like that which are kind of like they're obviously a you know like shared ownership properties and stuff which obviously like a little tiny sticking plaster on a big gaping wound</u>
<u n="802" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="803" who="S0628"><vocal desc="laugh"/> but it's just it's kind of how I see it but then on an individual basis like</u>
<u n="804" who="S0624">it does help people get by</u>
<u n="805" who="S0628">yeah what do you think what do you think about that in your interview? cos I don't</u>

<u n="809" who="S0628">I don't know what I think about it</u>
<u n="810" who="S0624">I think I I mean I think they'll like they they feed</u>
<u n="811" who="S0628">cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was like</u>
<u n="812" who="S0624" trans="overlap">and I know</u>

<u n="815" who="S0628">isn't it just inadequate? he was like well it it</u>
<u n="816" who="S0624">I think it's cos it feeds the same kind of like house as commodity model</u>
<u n="817" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="818" who="S0624">the money you just get really poor quality homes</u>
<u n="819" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="820" who="S0624">and the money goes like the <trunc>prof</trunc> like the it's just like if the structural <unclear>pot</unclear> like all the money is still going back to the developer</u>
<u n="821" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="822" who="S0624">it's like <pause dur="short"/> sure you're like but it's like government subsidising the developer is what it becomes</u>
<u n="823" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="824" who="S0624" trans="overlap">like cos they're the money that they buy into it allows those developers to sell their houses at that price</u>
<u n="825" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="826" who="S0624">like I just think it's like I yeah I'm <pause dur="short"/> not that into it</u>
<u n="827" who="S0628">yeah that's interesting that makes sense</u>
<u n="828" who="S0624">I just think it's like you know it's like</u>
<u n="829" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah I'm really struggling with it so much I think</u>
<u n="830" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="831" who="S0628">obviously I think it's a completely useless I mean</u>
<u n="832" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="833" who="S0628" trans="overlap">like policy in structural terms it's</u>
<u n="834" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="835" who="S0628" trans="overlap">obviously shit and doesn't it's like sort of looking like they're doing something without doing anything to</u>
<u n="836" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="837" who="S0628">tackle the actual problem it's like treating the symptom</u>
<u n="838" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="839" who="S0628">and not the cause</u>
<u n="840" who="S0624">like they just</u>
<u n="841" who="S0628" trans="overlap">but then I didn't know if it was like <unclear>does the government?</unclear></u>
<u n="842" who="S0624" trans="overlap">the housing crisis</u>
<u n="843" who="S0628" trans="overlap">I guess that like the money going to or like <unclear/> developers are giving the money sort of <unclear/></u>
<u n="844" who="S0624">and the thing is until you until you increase the stock of houses all that means is that those homes then just go straight back into the</u>
<u n="845" who="S0628">the market</u>
<u n="846" who="S0624">as soon as they're sold off like you're back to where you've started</u>
<u n="847" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="848" who="S0624">they're just lost in the melee</u>
<u n="849" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="850" who="S0624">and sold on at full price erm yeah I think like the starter homes now as well that's like another one</u>
<u n="851" who="S0628">what's that?</u>
<u n="852" who="S0624" trans="overlap">so it's like you have to the starter so it's like Cameron's new pledge so</u>
<u n="853" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="854" who="S0624">so instead of affordable housing targets they're gonna be building starter homes so in London the average price will be four hundred and fifty thousand pounds</u>
<u n="855" who="S0628">oh</u>
<u n="856" who="S0624" trans="overlap">for a starter home</u>
<u n="857" who="S0628">and what are they?</u>
<u n="858" who="S0624" trans="overlap">and that's getting rid of the affordable homes</u>
<u n="859" who="S0628">oh</u>
<u n="860" who="S0624">so affordable homes like you could get a starter <unclear/> market rate</u>
<u n="861" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="862" who="S0624">so it was like</u>
<u n="863" who="S0628">still <unclear>stupid</unclear></u>
<u n="864" who="S0624" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="865" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="866" who="S0624" trans="overlap">but it was lower than that</u>
<u n="867" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="868" who="S0624" trans="overlap">and like he's just wiped that and it's all now starter homes really <unclear/> but you also</u>
<u n="869" who="S0628">and what they? are the new builds?</u>
<u n="870" who="S0624">they're new builds so it's going to be part of like new build erm and the criteria for a new build new development it'll be you have to put in X number of starter homes</u>
<u n="871" who="S0628">okay and you buy them that way?</u>
<u n="872" who="S0624">mm</u>
<u n="873" who="S0628" trans="overlap">or you buy them in shared</u>
<u n="874" who="S0624">I don't think you buy them in shared I think you there's like special starter home mortgages that you get but erm <pause dur="short"/> they with affordable homes you have to they had to stay affordable I can't remember what the period was it something like twenty years or</u>
<u n="875" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="876" who="S0624">like there was <unclear>wrote it in the pledge that it</unclear> <unclear/> cos starter homes is five years? it's like like what the fuck? what is the point? and the only way they will ever solve the housing crisis</u>
<u n="877" who="S0628">is to build more houses</u>
<u n="878" who="S0624">is to build more houses</u>
<u n="879" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="880" who="S0624">and like the way to like there are set like the like yeah I told you about like the green belt like so if like the one if you wanted to do it if you wanted to do</u>
<u n="881" who="S0628" trans="overlap">well just there's a lot of land is not being built on yeah yeah</u>
<u n="882" who="S0624" trans="overlap">you you've got <trunc>r</trunc> <unclear/></u>
<u n="883" who="S0628" trans="overlap">I've read about this before</u>
<u n="884" who="S0624" trans="overlap">build the green belt legislation tomorrow you would bottom out the <trunc>h</trunc>housing market by flooding</u>
<u n="885" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="886" who="S0624" trans="overlap">the market with new homes which would then be</u>
<u n="887" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="888" who="S0624">affordable and the problem is that it's artificially scarce</u>
<u n="889" who="S0628" trans="overlap">so <unclear/> that's what really makes me feel angry about it with housing just like the clear vested interest in not like they don't want <unclear/> homeowners and home values to <unclear>go like</unclear> these wildly inflated home er values to go down</u>
<u n="890" who="S0624" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="891" who="S0628">so that has to happen so no one else</u>
<u n="892" who="S0624" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="893" who="S0628">can get any fucking houses</u>
<u n="894" who="S0624">yeah it's like it's so it's so intergenerational robbery it's really annoying</u>
<u n="895" who="S0628" trans="overlap">it's insane it's <trunc>ins</trunc> in London it's just obscene it's</u>
<u n="896" who="S0624" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="897" who="S0628" trans="overlap">something like the average house gained ten percent in value from like the beginning of twenty fifteen to the end</u>
<u n="898" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="899" who="S0628">it's like that was bonkers</u>
<u n="900" who="S0624">and it would be a problem for someone like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> for example like</u>
<u n="901" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="902" who="S0624"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> really compromised in the place that she bought</u>
<u n="903" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="904" who="S0624">and just got this obscene mortgage for this thing and like</u>
<u n="905" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="906" who="S0624" trans="overlap">it's not like not in terms of just compromise but like</u>
<u n="907" who="S0628">yeah she's spent such a lot for a house</u>
<u n="908" who="S0624" trans="overlap">from social housing and it was like</u>
<u n="909" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="910" who="S0624">put money back into it</u>
<u n="911" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="912" who="S0624">she would be absolutely fucked if the housing market</u>
<u n="913" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah would actually</u>
<u n="914" who="S0624" trans="overlap">bottomed out cos like that because like if you're building new builds then a fifties flat in a ex-council estate is gonna like no one's gonna want that compared to I still would cos I think it's</u>
<u n="915" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="916" who="S0624">like much nicer the majority of people wouldn't so like it would just be like not only would it like decrease in value but the places that people afford would also</u>
<u n="917" who="S0628">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="918" who="S0624">not be desirable at all</u>
<u n="919" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="920" who="S0624" trans="overlap">erm</u>
<u n="921" who="S0628">it's hard isn't it?</u>
<u n="922" who="S0624" trans="overlap">but <pause dur="short"/> like you you you don't have to do it the thing is that you don't have to do it like <trunc>d</trunc> like instantaneously you can do it gradually</u>
<u n="923" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah you do it slowly</u>
<u n="924" who="S0624">but like that's what it should be working towards cos like the thing is that like the green belt is there like partly as like our stupid view like idealised view of the</u>
<u n="925" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="926" who="S0624">English countryside and partly cos of this weird like well not weird but like a post war policy of needing to keep our cultural land</u>
<u n="927" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="928" who="S0624" trans="overlap">the the security and it's so outdated</u>
<u n="929" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="930" who="S0624" trans="overlap">like like so much of that land is unproductive</u>
<u n="931" who="S0628">there's a real paranoia about erm that once we start building on it then we're just gonna be like a horrible big urban sprawl</u>
<u n="932" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="933" who="S0628" trans="overlap">like I dunno like Moscow or <trunc>st</trunc> Seoul or something it's going say well aren't haven't we built on like</u>
<u n="934" who="S0624" trans="overlap">we already are</u>
<u n="935" who="S0628" trans="overlap">thirty per thirty percent of the UK is built on or something?</u>

<u n="937" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="938" who="S0624">absolutely nothing erm lots of that land is not very it's not like great land like protect like the national parks but everything else would be kind of fair game</u>
<u n="939" who="S0628">yeah</u>
<u n="940" who="S0624">you'd have to get planning permission so like</u>
<u n="941" who="S0628">but surely you could just make restrictions on what you can build on</u>
<u n="942" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="943" who="S0628">like you don't have to just be like okay we've lifted it like do what you want</u>
<u n="944" who="S0624">mm</u>
<u n="945" who="S0628" trans="overlap">you can replace it with legislation in the in different <unclear>technicalities</unclear></u>
<u n="946" who="S0624" trans="overlap">well like planning applications like so you have to</u>
<u n="947" who="S0628" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
