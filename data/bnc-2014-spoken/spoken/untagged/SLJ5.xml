<u n="1" who="S0679">so <trunc>h</trunc>how's your day gone?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0681">well I I it was good that I left early this morning because I erm it was a bit further than I anticipated and so I had to <vocal desc="laugh"/> skate get my skates on erm when I arrived at the <trunc>c</trunc> pub carpark everybody was there fortunately nobody else had got there desperately early so erm it wasn't a big deal in the end although I was panicking towards the end of the journey</u>
<u n="3" who="S0679">you weren't leading it?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0681">no no no I wasn't the leader erm I can't remember who was <trunc>l</trunc> oh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was the leader <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was the leader yeah</u>
<u n="5" who="S0679" trans="overlap">and was it <anon type="place"/> or <anon type="place"/>? you seemed to be a bit</u>
<u n="6" who="S0681" trans="overlap">it was</u>
<u n="7" who="S0679">undecided</u>
<u n="8" who="S0681">well we went to the village of <anon type="place"/> cos we went to the pub in <anon type="place"/> but we were walking around <anon type="place"/> but we went round a different direction than we'd done before so I didn't recognise any of it</u>
<u n="9" who="S0679">well there's quite a bit of it</u>
<u n="10" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0679">I mean we went up here years ago</u>
<u n="12" who="S0681">mm</u>

<u n="15" who="S0679">one January?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0681">I don't <trunc>rea</trunc> the things the place we walked round I don't recall remembering any of it from that trip though</u>
<u n="17" who="S0679">well it is kind of a bit difficult to</u>
<u n="18" who="S0681"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="19" who="S0679">I mean it's all kind of flat and looks the same really</u>
<u n="20" who="S0681">yeah <trunc>d</trunc> we did we go past the <anon type="place"/> centre?</u>
<u n="21" who="S0679">I don't think they had a <anon type="place"/> centre</u>
<u n="22" who="S0681" trans="overlap">well they've got a cottage which is a <anon type="place"/> centre it's only open at the weekends but the we went past that certainly but we didn't go past a er a a major sort of show building or anything like that at all</u>
<u n="23" who="S0679">well did you go to the main entrance? I'd have thought there was only one</u>
<u n="24" who="S0681" trans="overlap">no we didn't no no no er somebody else said we think we're sneaking in the back door</u>
<u n="25" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="26" who="S0681">we seemed to go through lots of fields and things the one that's really nice there was okay winter it was fairly low sun but because there wasn't much cloud there was the sun behind all the <unclear>reeds</unclear> you have the flags that wave about so they really looked quite spectacular oh and we saw some horses we saw some horses the funny horses in the</u>
<u n="27" who="S0679" trans="overlap">oh now that the funny horses we saw from a walk from the walk from <anon type="place"/> didn't we?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0681">yeah was that with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0679">yeah is that the same place?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0681">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0679">I don't really know the geography but you said you might head for <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="32" who="S0681">yeah well yeah I got there via <anon type="place"/> so it's quite a bit further out from <anon type="place"/> yeah yes these are Przewalski horses or something</u>
<u n="33" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="34" who="S0681">but that quite happy on the quite coarse grazing there we saw some highland cattle as well both were quite a long way away the horses looked very suspicious they were watching us go there was about twelve of them they were <trunc>qui</trunc> about well I dunno six seven hundred metres away but they were watching us very suspiciously <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="35" who="S0679">I wonder if you'd gone into <anon type="place"/> proper would you not have to show your National Trust membership?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0681">I don't know I don't know I don't</u>
<u n="37" who="S0679" trans="overlap">well did you?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0681">no not at all there was no we didn't go through any barriers or gates or anything</u>
<u n="39" who="S0679">and not even at the <anon type="place"/> centre?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0681">no no that was at the side of the public road you know?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0679">mm was that part of <anon type="place"/> or not?</u>
<u n="42" who="S0681">it <trunc>w</trunc> it <vocal desc="misc"/> it may have been I'm not entirely sure</u>
<u n="43" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0681">it seemed to be a <trunc>cer</trunc> well there was a sign on their fence that said <anon type="place"/> National Trust that way with an arrow</u>
<u n="45" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0681">you know but I don't know if that was actually a National Trust building at all</u>
<u n="47" who="S0679">mm and you had your lunch in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="48" who="S0681">yeah the pub was very nice the <anon type="place"/> I think it was yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0679">does do they just have one do you think? is it that sort of place?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0681" trans="overlap">yes I think so it's not a big place but the the funny thing was just as we were about to set up another walking group arrived and they were having lunch at the pub as well so we <vocal desc="laugh"/> checked the times fortunately they weren't eating till one o'clock and we were we'd set to twelve thirty but when we left after the meal the pub was actually stuffed to the gunnels</u>
<u n="51" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0681">there wasn't a spare space anywhere for food so they obviously they the food was very good so they've obviously got quite a reputation</u>
<u n="53" who="S0679">what did you have?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0681">oh I had stroganoff</u>
<u n="55" who="S0679">uhu</u>
<u n="56" who="S0681">which was superb somebody else had a sandwich which came a doorstep sandwich which came with a load of chips and green stuff and they were only expecting a thin <unclear>girly</unclear> sandwich</u>
<u n="57" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0681"><vocal desc="laugh"/> so they were a bit</u>
<u n="59" who="S0679">so everyone was happy with that one?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0681">oh yeah oh yeah I think everybody did well you know so what have you been up to?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0679">well erm largely sorting out my online accounts which I made sure I could access them properly I also just wanted to update my well I wanted to be sure I knew what sort of interest I was getting on accounts</u>
<u n="62" who="S0681"><vocal desc="laugh"/> bugger all I imagine</u>
<u n="63" who="S0679" trans="overlap">because when my pension comes through I'll have the opportunity of putting some more money in</u>
<u n="64" who="S0681" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0679">an interest <trunc>a</trunc></u>
<u n="66" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0679" trans="overlap">er in a a savings sort of account</u>
<u n="68" who="S0681"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="69" who="S0679">erm and also setting up an ISA for the year</u>
<u n="70" who="S0681">have you have you found anything worthwhile for</u>
<u n="71" who="S0679">erm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0681">interest-wise?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0679">well I know where I'm going to put my money initially because it's always easier to open another account with a building society</u>
<u n="74" who="S0681" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0679">you're already with</u>
<u n="76" who="S0681">but we the National <pause dur="short"/> savings pensioner bonds were quite a good interest rate</u>
<u n="77" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0681">but they may have gone down after the first year all of these things seem to go down</u>
<u n="79" who="S0679" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0681">after a year</u>
<u n="81" who="S0679">yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0681" trans="overlap">don't they?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0679">and erm oh there is <pause dur="short"/> yeah I saw something that had twelve months of interest on it interesting interest</u>
<u n="84" who="S0681">interesting interest?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0679">I think it was a Tesco account</u>
<u n="86" who="S0681">yeah I had some money in that but they've they sent me a letter saying they're reducing the interest rate to the square root of bugger all you know?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0679">oh is that their current account?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0681">no no no I had erm I just had a a a savings account</u>
<u n="89" who="S0679">oh</u>
<u n="90" who="S0681" trans="overlap">of some description I think it was kind of at two percent</u>
<u n="91" who="S0679" trans="overlap">well have a look again</u>
<u n="92" who="S0681">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0679">and cos I think you can get if you do an internet one you can one point seven five for the first year</u>
<u n="94" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0679">so I'm going to work on the current account cos you said you get some interest on that</u>
<u n="96" who="S0681">from from which which <trunc>comp</trunc></u>
<u n="97" who="S0679" trans="overlap">Tesco</u>
<u n="98" who="S0681">mm no I didn't say you get interest on the current account from Tescos</u>
<u n="99" who="S0679">oh I think you did cos you told me you've got one</u>
<u n="100" who="S0681">no I haven't got a current account with Tescos</u>
<u n="101" who="S0679">well anyway I have well I'm in the process of getting one and then I've <trunc>g</trunc> obviously I won't open the the one where you only get the high interest for a year until I've actually got the money to put in it</u>
<u n="102" who="S0681">well</u>
<u n="103" who="S0679">erm but I ought to <trunc>d</trunc> I I mean you don't get very much at all but I've got to do something with it and depending on how much money I get you know that rate has gone down to er the protection is seventy-five thousand</u>
<u n="104" who="S0681">mm yes yes you of course if you're gonna get a big lump sum you're gonna have to spread it around ain't you?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0679">well I've it's not gonna be so large I have to spread it very far</u>
<u n="106" who="S0681"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="107" who="S0679">but because of the way I</u>
<u n="108" who="S0681" trans="overlap">well you're a moneyed woman aren't you? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="109" who="S0679">the way I've got erm accounts set up erm I do need to fiddle around with my Nationwide one to make sure that's a legit</u>
<u n="110" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0679">erm and they will Nationwide will let you take ten thousand pounds out of any erm account if it helps you get your you know without a penalty if it helps you get your money down</u>
<u n="112" who="S0681">oh gets you under the er is it</u>
<u n="113" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0681">eighty-five thousand now?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0679">well it was eighty-five it's gonna go down to seventy-five from January</u>
<u n="116" who="S0681" trans="overlap">oh right oh that's <unclear>fine</unclear></u>
<u n="117" who="S0679">and there's a on one of the sites it talked about and after April I think it is all erm interest account is gonna pay er without tax being deducted so</u>
<u n="118" who="S0681" trans="overlap">so is that</u>
<u n="119" who="S0679">you have to</u>
<u n="120" who="S0681" trans="overlap">is that</u>
<u n="121" who="S0679" trans="overlap">declare your own tax presumably</u>
<u n="122" who="S0681" trans="overlap">oh that's</u>
<u n="123" who="S0679">but</u>
<u n="124" who="S0681">well that's bloody stupid isn't it? because that means</u>
<u n="125" who="S0679" trans="overlap">seems it's it's likely to cause more employment opportunities in the er the the tax department</u>
<u n="126" who="S0681" trans="overlap">in the tax well more <trunc>opp</trunc> or opportunities with accountants as well I suspect</u>
<u n="127" who="S0679">well it makes it a bit more complicated I I I can't see any good reason for it erm</u>
<u n="128" who="S0681">no I'd have thought it would have been easier for the Inland Revenue because it was all done corporately so they got a big wodge of money from each bank and they didn't have to pursue it</u>
<u n="129" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0681">now they're gonna get little dribbles of money from or little dribbles of sort of tax demands from that millions of people</u>
<u n="131" who="S0679">unless they think it's a way of checking if you give so much interest one year and give get a lot more interest the next year perhaps that's a way of sussing out who's got more who's you know who's got money they haven't declared but I mean don't</u>
<u n="132" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0679" trans="overlap">unscrupulous people won't actually declare it will they? I mean</u>
<u n="134" who="S0681" trans="overlap">well no quite yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0679" trans="overlap">you'd only <trunc>dec</trunc> er declare it at whatever you're allowed to have every year</u>
<u n="136" who="S0681">because</u>
<u n="137" who="S0679">so it's a bit strange really</u>
<u n="138" who="S0681">yeah cos when you fill in a tax return you still have to declare interest but they crosscheck that against what they've returned cos I used to get that when I did the detailed tax return <unclear>they they would think</unclear> they would mash their figures to mine</u>
<u n="139" who="S0679">uhu</u>
<u n="140" who="S0681">and often they weren't exactly the same but as long as they were fairly close they didn't seem to worry too much about it</u>
<u n="141" who="S0679">and have you erm heard about the second home business?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0681">no what's gonna happen on that?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0679" trans="overlap">if you buy a second home or potentially if you buy <pause dur="short"/> a new house before you've sold your old house or anything like this</u>
<u n="144" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0679">erm you have to pay higher rates of stamp duty</u>
<u n="146" who="S0681">oh yeah I've heard about that I'm not I wasn't sure of the erm how it was hedged about with erm advantages and restrictions so cos you know sometimes you don't sell them by at the same time and so</u>
<u n="147" who="S0679" trans="overlap">well I don't know I mean apparently they're gonna have to have a month or two months to suss out what it might mean</u>
<u n="148" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0679">but I think it's an attempt to try and share the houses round more people</u>
<u n="150" who="S0681">well which is not that</u>
<u n="151" who="S0679" trans="overlap">but</u>
<u n="152" who="S0681">I still like Westminster Council's idea that if you're not registered to vote there you pay a lot more tax</u>
<u n="153" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="154" who="S0681">I think that's a brilliant idea</u>
<u n="155" who="S0679">well</u>
<u n="156" who="S0681" trans="overlap">because it catches empty property as well</u>
<u n="157" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="158" who="S0681">that's the thing that so often escapes the net</u>
<u n="159" who="S0679">and they might be going to charge people from abroad more</u>
<u n="160" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="161" who="S0679">er well at least as much as everyone else has to pay</u>
<u n="162" who="S0681">charge them what? stamp <trunc>d</trunc></u>
<u n="163" who="S0679">well <trunc>h</trunc> the the <trunc>m</trunc> even if they've only even when they buy their first one</u>
<u n="164" who="S0681">mm yeah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0679">but it might</u>
<u n="166" who="S0681"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="167" who="S0679">it will make it a bit more expensive for erm</u>
<u n="168" who="S0681">inward investment</u>
<u n="169" who="S0679">landlords to buy</u>
<u n="170" who="S0681" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="171" who="S0679">multiple properties</u>
<u n="172" who="S0681">yes I did recall</u>
<u n="173" who="S0679" trans="overlap">but I mean unless it's expensive it's not gonna make a huge difference</u>
<u n="174" who="S0681">no it'll just push the prices back up again wouldn't it? which is not</u>
<u n="175" who="S0679">well it may depress prices for a while it may just put rents up</u>
<u n="176" who="S0681">I think the only thing that'll depress prices is building a hell of a sight more houses</u>
<u n="177" who="S0679">well</u>
<u n="178" who="S0681" trans="overlap">well I think the government</u>
<u n="179" who="S0679" trans="overlap">we don't really want that do we?</u>
<u n="180" who="S0681">well I don't know you know</u>
<u n="181" who="S0679">well if we want it but it's not in our back garden</u>
<u n="182" who="S0681">yes <vocal desc="laugh"/> that's right yes</u>
<u n="183" who="S0679">but probably living in the houses in the parts of the country where there aren't jobs would help</u>
<u n="184" who="S0681">well that's right yeah and <unclear/></u>
<u n="185" who="S0679" trans="overlap">and why build on any more of the countryside? why make <anon type="place"/> three times as big? because there might be people living here and then</u>
<u n="186" who="S0681">mm why <trunc>d</trunc> why did <anon type="place"/> move from <anon type="place"/> to <anon type="place"/>? you know they said <unclear>nominally</unclear> was to be near the university but I these days with communication and things like that good grief you don't really need to be physically near anywhere do you? they're not physically near their manufacturing plants which are all in the Far East</u>
<u n="187" who="S0679">mm mm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0681">so there must be another reason</u>
<u n="189" who="S0679">well I mean maybe it's easier to get the labour down here</u>
<u n="190" who="S0681">mm the skilled labour?</u>
<u n="191" who="S0679">the skill</u>
<u n="192" who="S0681" trans="overlap">I wouldn't have thought so we are maybe like yeah I don't know I know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was erm could get I'm fairly certain she could get a job there but <vocal desc="cough"/> they're not a good company to work for apparently</u>
<u n="193" who="S0679">well if she doesn't absolutely need a job but could have a job then that puts her in a good position</u>
<u n="194" who="S0681" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah she's very highly skilled</u>
<u n="195" who="S0679">anyway she may be doing enough with what she's got</u>
<u n="196" who="S0681">yeah she's not earning big money but <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s earning good enough so</u>
<u n="197" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="198" who="S0681">and they've paid off their mortgage so they're quite they're sitting pretty really</u>
<u n="199" who="S0679">anyway how how are we left with this front door?</u>
<u n="200" who="S0681">erm we have to lock it from the inside to lock it the cos you can open it from the outside now if you've not locked it with a key from the inside you can just open it from the outside</u>
<u n="201" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="202" who="S0681">yeah? because it hasn't got as there's a thing called a split <pause dur="short"/> barrel? no it's not a barrel a split something or other which we've not got at the moment cos that's part of the problem the locksmith has ordered the part we need and when it comes in he will phone me to let me know</u>
<u n="203" who="S0679">I take it he didn't really like the lock you took in?</u>
<u n="204" who="S0681">no he was he was quite amenable he says it's a he says it's a bit unusual he says erm it's not a standard lock because when I looked on the web on to find out it's all a great thing you can actually look on the web and look this all up</u>
<u n="205" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="206" who="S0681">the standard locks are seventeen millimetres wide and you can buy whole replacement locks for about a hundred pounds you know having said that the barrels and handles are all separate again you know? and the handles are twenty quid</u>
<u n="207" who="S0679">mm you fitted a very stylish erm door <trunc>ha</trunc> door handle on your door</u>
<u n="208" who="S0681" trans="overlap">it's it's the only one they had <vocal desc="laugh"/> in the right size</u>
<u n="209" who="S0679">oh</u>
<u n="210" who="S0681">the and erm the</u>
<u n="211" who="S0679" trans="overlap">it doesn't no <unclear/> I haven't seen it very closely</u>
<u n="212" who="S0681">it's it's very carefully fitted because it</u>
<u n="213" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="214" who="S0681">cos it's much narrower than the old one but when he gets the part he'll phone me and I'll go in and collect it it's gonna be a lot of money could be up to a hundred quid for this part and then I had to ring back take the whole mechanism off again and replace the bit the lock behind the centre</u>
<u n="215" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="216" who="S0681">and he says it's a bit fiddly to do he says but but he seemed to be quite confident I could do it so they were very busy when I was in there really busy cutting keys like men possessed they were</u>
<u n="217" who="S0679">oh what's mm it's not a particularly <trunc>s</trunc> time of the year for students to be starting</u>
<u n="218" who="S0681">no no these were <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>locals</unclear></u>
<u n="219" who="S0679" trans="overlap">would it be a good opportunity or would it be a not a good opportunity to take the keys round when you go back?</u>
<u n="220" who="S0681">take the key round? where?</u>
<u n="221" who="S0679" trans="overlap">you know I need some keys cutting cos we decided one of the keys we only had one of didn't we?</u>
<u n="222" who="S0681">oh which? the front door or back door?</u>
<u n="223" who="S0679">I don't know perhaps you found some more for the patio door in the end one of the doors there was only one of them</u>
<u n="224" who="S0681">no for the back doors we've certainly got a we've got two sets complete sets of keys for everything</u>
<u n="225" who="S0679">mm well I think we ought to no I think have we got more than <trunc>t</trunc> one one each for the front door?</u>
<u n="226" who="S0681">well I don't know where was the key you gave me? is that your normal front door key?</u>
<u n="227" who="S0679">are we talking about here?</u>
<u n="228" who="S0681">yeah</u>
<u n="229" who="S0679">I'm not</u>
<u n="230" who="S0681">ah that</u>
<u n="231" who="S0679" trans="overlap">so okay</u>
<u n="232" who="S0681" trans="overlap">actually changes the issue yes right carry on</u>
<u n="233" who="S0679" trans="overlap">that that key</u>
<u n="234" who="S0681" trans="overlap">reset</u>
<u n="235" who="S0679">okay let's talk about keys here then first the key that is in the front door is the one that lives in my my belt so if I go out</u>
<u n="236" who="S0681" trans="overlap">is that your main key?</u>
<u n="237" who="S0679">my main key is slightly bent and belongs with my</u>
<u n="238" who="S0681" trans="overlap">right so</u>
<u n="239" who="S0679" trans="overlap">with my car key</u>
<u n="240" who="S0681">you've got two keys and I've got one so we've got three keys basically</u>
<u n="241" who="S0679">okay so I've got a slightly bent key and I've got a key that isn't bent the reason I've got the other one is because I don't always take my car keys out when I go out at the moment cos I quite often go in your car and but I have also got a spare key upstairs</u>
<u n="242" who="S0681">so we've got four keys one of which is bent okay and you're holding on to three of them <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="243" who="S0679">well it hangs it's it's hanging on the chest of drawers upstairs</u>
<u n="244" who="S0681" trans="overlap">alright okay</u>
<u n="245" who="S0679">on a long loop of string and I put it there in case I had to throw it out the window for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> if I if I couldn't get down <trunc>t</trunc> you know if I needed her to come in</u>
<u n="246" who="S0681">oh right</u>
<u n="247" who="S0679">that's how we got up there</u>
<u n="248" who="S0681">okay fine</u>
<u n="249" who="S0679">but I'll bring that one down and</u>
<u n="250" who="S0681" trans="overlap">no no <unclear>you can use that</unclear></u>
<u n="251" who="S0679" trans="overlap">use it in the front door because I'd rather have one in my</u>
<u n="252" who="S0681">okay</u>
<u n="253" who="S0679" trans="overlap">in my belt</u>
<u n="254" who="S0681" trans="overlap">yeah we'll in while we're messing about for the next two days do that swap them round yeah erm now did you want to say there was something about the keys that <unclear/></u>
<u n="255" who="S0679">yeah I'm sure</u>
<u n="256" who="S0681" trans="overlap">I'm not sure what sets of keys we had we had hundreds of keys and most of them didn't fit anything you know</u>
<u n="257" who="S0679" trans="overlap">yeah but I'm sure there was one door we only had one key for is it actually a good time to actually go round is it good when you go back to collect it to have keys cut? or or is it better to keep that transaction simple?</u>
<u n="258" who="S0681">well I can do the same fine yeah I'm er I've half a mind to take take the whole thing off and take it with me and get them to do it</u>
<u n="259" who="S0679">well if you do</u>
<u n="260" who="S0681" trans="overlap">he <trunc>s</trunc> he seemed er I said do you need me to take door? oh no he says it's quite easy you can do it yourself he says yeah</u>
<u n="261" who="S0679">well that's up to you</u>
<u n="262" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="263" who="S0679">if it when are you going to do it?</u>
<u n="264" who="S0681" trans="overlap">actually well when he gets the part in probably</u>
<u n="265" who="S0679" trans="overlap">and when when</u>
<u n="266" who="S0681" trans="overlap">Friday he says day or two</u>
<u n="267" who="S0679">Friday okay well</u>

<u n="271" who="S0679">it's your black bin this week</u>
<u n="272" who="S0681" trans="overlap">oh I put it out it's got quite a lot in it</u>
<u n="273" who="S0679">oh have you been throwing things away?</u>

<u n="288" who="S0681">the <trunc>supermar</trunc> yeah okay packing it's called I think</u>
<u n="289" who="S0679">yes it's a sort of I think it's meant to absorb any nasties but it can certainly absorb a lot of fish smell</u>
<u n="290" who="S0681">so we could have the cat in the bin tonight then?</u>
<u n="291" who="S0679">no it's not that strong I gave it a wipe over</u>

<u n="295" who="S0679">so erm now tomorrow you said you'd got you've got something in the morning</u>
<u n="296" who="S0681">I'm going to the genome project in the morning</u>
<u n="297" who="S0679">are you? you've been saying for weeks you're going there is this</u>
<u n="298" who="S0681" trans="overlap">yeah <trunc>ye</trunc></u>
<u n="299" who="S0679" trans="overlap">the time you really go?</u>
<u n="300" who="S0681" trans="overlap">they kept moving it around yeah yeah</u>
<u n="301" who="S0679">have you been there before?</u>
<u n="302" who="S0681">yeah I have I have I didn't realise well that's some the thing I remember from <pause dur="short"/> er somebody was trying to get some concept of how much data is involved in having a complete genotype</u>
<u n="303" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="304" who="S0681">and somebody said well you need about a terabyte hard drive to hold it</u>
<u n="305" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="306" who="S0681">so that gives you a pretty good idea how much information is involved rather a lot <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="307" who="S0679">yeah I mean it depends how they've got it stored really I mean</u>
<u n="308" who="S0681">they've got a lot of</u>
<u n="309" who="S0679" trans="overlap">do you just mean a terabyte as in my <trunc>har</trunc> my <pause dur="short"/> my removable</u>
<u n="310" who="S0681">drive yeah</u>
<u n="311" who="S0679">yeah I mean I</u>
<u n="312" who="S0681" trans="overlap">per person</u>
<u n="313" who="S0679">oh per person?</u>
<u n="314" who="S0681">per person <pause dur="short"/> so <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah you can imagine the amount of storage they've got to</u>
<u n="315" who="S0679" trans="overlap">well it's a lot of messages to get you know</u>
<u n="316" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="317" who="S0679">you don't want your left leg coming out like your right leg do you?</u>
<u n="318" who="S0681">no</u>
<u n="319" who="S0679" trans="overlap">I mean you need them different</u>
<u n="320" who="S0681">I might actually take my er my genotype my the little bit of information I've got with me</u>
<u n="321" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="322" who="S0681">and if there's time ask the question you know so they almost certainly the guide won't be able to tell give me anything tell me anything but <pause dur="short"/> but er I I</u>
<u n="323" who="S0679" trans="overlap">make your own up with</u>
<u n="324" who="S0681"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="325" who="S0679">coloured shapes</u>
<u n="326" who="S0681">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> <trunc>m</trunc>my I get the impression they did the four genotype because the research panel expressed an interest cos</u>
<u n="327" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="328" who="S0681">when the erm cardiac specialist saw it it wasn't room <trunc>f</trunc> it was the other one her boss I think he says we'll have a bit of a job justifying actually running the genotype cos they've got it's about seven thousand quid it reckoned it cost although on my information now it's down to about two now</u>
<u n="329" who="S0679">well isn't that the price <unclear>to do things</unclear>?</u>
<u n="330" who="S0681">yeah and erm then I said oh I'm on the er on the the research <trunc>pane</trunc> oh he said then in that case there might be some quite a lot of advantages for <trunc>doi</trunc> for getting you to do it if we do you</u>
<u n="331" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="332" who="S0681">then we can store it and use it for as part of the research panel as well so</u>
<u n="333" who="S0679">so are you going to have your your erm your drive done in coloured bricks to</u>
<u n="334" who="S0681"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="335" who="S0679">follow you er</u>

<u n="338" who="S0681" trans="overlap">or whatever it is yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0679">I was thinking of the path you know</u>
<u n="340" who="S0681">oh right oh that would be fun wouldn't it? <trunc>st</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="341" who="S0679" trans="overlap">imagine by get a longer path but it's quite long</u>
<u n="342" who="S0681" trans="overlap">the <trunc>ye</trunc></u>
<u n="343" who="S0679" trans="overlap">isn't it?</u>
<u n="344" who="S0681">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's never gonna be long enough though is it?</u>
<u n="345" who="S0679">no and you could do a little bit of it</u>
<u n="346" who="S0681">mm mm</u>
<u n="347" who="S0679"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> might not be up for it</u>
<u n="348" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="349" who="S0679">oh the</u>
<u n="350" who="S0681" trans="overlap">oh he'll be up for anything if you pay him enough money</u>
<u n="351" who="S0679">yeah</u>
<u n="352" who="S0681">yeah but I think we might end up with Ashfelt actually</u>
<u n="353" who="S0679">so</u>
<u n="354" who="S0681" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="355" who="S0679">so erm just think you're so you're doing that in the morning</u>
<u n="356" who="S0681">yeah</u>
<u n="357" who="S0679">and then you're coming back</u>
<u n="358" who="S0681">yeah</u>
<u n="359" who="S0679">and that's the afternoon you can take the my my reserve rollator</u>
<u n="360" who="S0681">mm</u>
<u n="361" who="S0679">to <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="362" who="S0681">yeah</u>
<u n="363" who="S0679">and I <trunc>h</trunc> I thought really I should go first and sort my clothes out before collection</u>
<u n="364" who="S0681">uhu</u>
<u n="365" who="S0679">but I could A either make a start on doing that just for a few minutes <pause dur="short"/> I see I don't <trunc>kno</trunc></u>
<u n="366" who="S0681" trans="overlap">all your all your all your boxes of clothes are carefully labelled are they?</u>
<u n="367" who="S0679">well all the ones in the wardrobe are labelled</u>
<u n="368" who="S0681">uhu</u>
<u n="369" who="S0679">so they're they're fine it's the ones that erm are <pause dur="short"/> it's you know those big plasticy ones that are red yellow and blue with wheels?</u>
<u n="370" who="S0681">oh boxes not big plasticky clothes?</u>
<u n="371" who="S0679">no no you know the big ones</u>
<u n="372" who="S0681">yeah yeah yeah ones the ones that look like treasure chests?</u>
<u n="373" who="S0679">yes</u>
<u n="374" who="S0681" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="375" who="S0679">exactly erm and possibly could be yeah I don't know I suppose they plastic goes a bit brittle cos I could probably</u>
<u n="376" who="S0681" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="377" who="S0679">sell them otherwise couldn't I?</u>
<u n="378" who="S0681">yeah</u>
<u n="379" who="S0679">on Gumtree and buy something probably a little more appropriate</u>
<u n="380" who="S0681">yeah</u>
<u n="381" who="S0679">or indeed possibly eliminate them now I've got the other ones erm <pause dur="short"/> I don't know how much they've got in and they're quite bulky</u>
<u n="382" who="S0681">mm so what I need to do is before I go is to fold all the back of the car down</u>
<u n="383" who="S0679">well you're gonna have the rollator in anyway don't worry about doing it before you go</u>
<u n="384" who="S0681">no it makes more sense to do it before you go cos it means I can take the cover off and it's a lot easier to do here</u>
<u n="385" who="S0679"><trunc>oka</trunc> is it? cos I thought</u>
<u n="386" who="S0681" trans="overlap">oh yes</u>
<u n="387" who="S0679">you could be doing it at <anon type="place"/> while I'm sorting out</u>
<u n="388" who="S0681" trans="overlap">no it doesn't take very long but if I'm gonna take things out the car it's a lot easier to do it here cos I shove it all in the garage then</u>
<u n="389" who="S0679">okay <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="390" who="S0681">I need a few minutes cos I've got when I went on the walk I I <vocal desc="laugh"/> I put the big thick sweater on where you know it was glorious weather this morning</u>

<u n="393" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="394" who="S0681">so I've emptied the bag out on the back seat so it all needs to go back in the bag again</u>
<u n="395" who="S0679">and you've got a few things in the corner I don't know what status they are</u>

<u n="400" who="S0681" trans="overlap">ah is this the one where you tidy up by hiding things under the settee?</u>
<u n="401" who="S0679">well I had to put them somewhere when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> came so I put them there</u>
<u n="402" who="S0681">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="403" who="S0679">I think it was when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> came cos that was a little while ago but I thought you'd have worn it since then don't you take it when you go walking?</u>
