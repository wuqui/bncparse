<u n="1" who="S0523" whoConfidence="low">right</u>
<u n="2" who="S0486">right <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you're going to talk about China today and your recent visit there</u>
<u n="3" who="S0523">yes <trunc>u</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> er yes indeed I er <pause dur="short"/> erm I <unclear/> went to erm to China <trunc>a</trunc>at the end of September came back in October we were there for about three weeks or so three to four weeks <pause dur="short"/> and erm yeah I've got some photos that I can use to <pause dur="short"/> sort of discuss <pause dur="short"/> or or just tell you a little bit about the what happened <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> and the first the first one I I'll show you the last photo I er we took <pause dur="short"/> it's a bit of a selfie</u>
<u n="4" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh right</u>
<u n="5" who="S0523">and it was it's me <pause dur="short"/> er looking at <pause dur="short"/> a a a nice cup of coffee <pause dur="short"/> and this this is in <anon type="place"/> airport <pause dur="short"/> and it was the last drink <pause dur="short"/> to use up the <trunc>c</trunc> <trunc>l</trunc>local currency <pause dur="short"/> and erm <pause dur="short"/> and you notice there are <pause dur="short"/> er there are two two erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> when it when it when when it <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's when the camera behaves itself <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> erm and you notice there's two straws and a stirrer <pause dur="short"/> and this turned out to be the most expensive cup of coffee er I've ever paid for <pause dur="short"/> it was er a ordinary cup of coffee I would say and it was six pounds for a cup of coffee</u>
<u n="6" who="S0486" trans="overlap">gosh</u>
<u n="7" who="S0523">and I don't think anywhere possibly in China was that much <pause dur="short"/> most cups of coffee in China were probably around erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> the erm <trunc>w</trunc>what they are in this country about <pause dur="short"/> two and a <trunc>ha</trunc> to two pound fifty-three pounds but this was <pause dur="short"/> we only had so much currency left and we thought we'd have two cups of coffee <pause dur="short"/> but in the end <vocal desc="laugh"/> everyone erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>o</trunc>on our on our in our group <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>t</trunc> decided that this was just six pounds was just too much so everyone asked <vocal desc="laugh"/> for a straw two straws <pause dur="short"/> to to have our er to have the coffee anyway that it's just a it's a little bit of <trunc>f</trunc>  of fun there <pause dur="short"/> erm but if I go to the <trunc>begi</trunc> the <trunc>f</trunc> the first first place we went to <pause dur="short"/> which was erm we arrived in Beijing er at the end of September the weather was <pause dur="short"/> very very kind to us actually because Beijing can be very erm <vocal desc="misc"/> er they have a lot of pollution and er but the two two to three days we were there it was erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>a</trunc>as far as one could tell it was er <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>no</trunc> well it's nice and sunny you could walk around it was lovely and warm <pause dur="short"/> and er and it was really right quite you know quite pleasant erm <pause dur="short"/> er place to to walk around but er <trunc>i</trunc> the the pollution <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>ca</trunc> er we were told can get down to very it can be very very bad er <trunc>ha</trunc><trunc>h</trunc> bad levels of pollution so people are have to wear masks and that sort of thing but we didn't <pause dur="short"/> while we were there we didn't <trunc>no</trunc> we didn't see that <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> we did hear that when we got to Shanghai at the end of our trip that in Beijing that the the pollution had closed in and er the index we were told was over three hundred <pause dur="short"/> er <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>how</trunc>however they rate the pollution index but it was over three hundred the erm <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> and apparently London in comparison so someone was saying the pollution index in London <pause dur="short"/> which some consider to be quite bad <trunc>w</trunc>was ten to fifteen</u>
<u n="8" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="9" who="S0523" trans="overlap">so so the the difference between Beijing on a bad day and London is er is a is a different erm er you know different kind of <vocal desc="laugh"/> er</u>
<u n="10" who="S0486">category?</u>
<u n="11" who="S0523">category altogether really <pause dur="short"/> anyway we were we went round erm er we went round erm <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> er Beijing <pause dur="short"/> erm on our <trunc>t</trunc> couple of days and we went through to what's called a summer palace and erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>a</trunc>and this was er <pause dur="short"/> the the the <trunc>th</trunc> one of the things that I hadn't fully appreciated erm when when we went until we went there just how much history there is in China I mean you they their history goes back erm thousands of years</u>
<u n="12" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0523" trans="overlap">and it's just <pause dur="short"/> mind blowing absolutely mind blowing so</u>
<u n="14" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="15" who="S0523">it it it was a fascinating <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> and I don't think the Chinese themselves actually have erm <pause dur="short"/> er have appreciated just how historical their erm <pause dur="short"/> er you know how much history they actually have and and and you probably know of erm it's was on the Antiques Roadshow the other day that because erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>th</trunc><trunc>they</trunc>they've over the years they've got rid of a lot of their antiques</u>
<u n="16" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0523">and the antiques are appearing in the Antiques Roadshow and various places all over the</u>
<u n="18" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0523">all over the world that the Chinese now want to er repatriate as many antiques as possible</u>
<u n="20" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="21" who="S0523">erm and er and I think a lot of their <trunc>his</trunc> kind of old historical houses they <pause dur="short"/> may have they may have <trunc>d</trunc> er discarded or <trunc>d</trunc> or just thrown away lots of really ancient erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> er antiques and now they they they need to kind of refurnish er they've realised now what a big draw</u>
<u n="22" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="23" who="S0523">er er it is for tourists I'm not sure if they still really think <pause dur="short"/> erm you know that they have er a <pause dur="short"/> I mean like <trunc>w</trunc> ourselves and the royal family erm is is a is is probably a a much closer feeling than a <trunc>Chin</trunc> a normal an average Chinese person to their emperors the emperors were you know a kinda long gone</u>
<u n="24" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0523">erm <pause dur="short"/> type of thing whereas the the royal <trunc>fam</trunc> so so but anyway they are trying to erm <pause dur="short"/> to erm er make a big thing of all their historical monuments now and of course they've got the terracotta <trunc>v</trunc> er army as well terracotta warriors <pause dur="short"/> major major thing erm but erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> er yes the er er er <trunc>h</trunc> <trunc>ah</trunc> how <trunc>ah</trunc> how <trunc>s</trunc> how can er one say? <pause dur="short"/> their the mm</u>
<u n="26" who="S0486" trans="overlap">well well it's a bit like the National Trust isn't it? because the National Trust erm get homes donated to them to the country</u>
<u n="27" who="S0523">yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0486">and then they have to then furnish them again and look for antiques and they buy a lot of antiques for things to go in the National Trust so it's exactly the same thing but the <trunc>China</trunc>Chinese are really needing things now I mean if if you've got something tucked away in a cupboard or in the attic or</u>
<u n="29" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0486">aunt Flo's old bowl or something that nobody thought was any great value</u>
<u n="31" who="S0523">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0486">but to the Chinese it can be worth a huge amount of <pause dur="short"/> it is worth a huge amount of money to them to get it back</u>
<u n="33" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah it it it <trunc>c</trunc> it <trunc>c</trunc> it could be worth a</u>
<u n="34" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0523">an awful lot of money and erm <pause dur="short"/> erm and and it does depend on the erm <pause dur="short"/> the on the Antiques Roadshow they were saying it depends on what you know like all antiques it depends what is erm popular at any one time so the erm the Tang dynasty was the er the the emperor then he really encouraged arts and culture and there was a period of er er prolonged erm <vocal desc="misc"/> stability in the country and that gave rise to lots of erm arts and crafts which have erm we went into a couple of really really top notch er museums where the er and art galleries where they've got all these a lot of these artefacts going back to <vocal desc="misc"/> er six thousand years BC it's an absolutely</u>
<u n="36" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0523">absolutely phenomenal er the the art and the the skill er because they didn't have all the modern equipment that we have today so they er you could you could see what sort of skills they had</u>
<u n="38" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0523"><trunc>th</trunc> oh you know six thousand years ago it was it was it was quite quite erm quite something</u>
<u n="40" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> and of course Chinese medicine is the oldest and most ancient form of medicine in the world</u>
<u n="41" who="S0523">yes yes indeed <unclear>and er</unclear></u>
<u n="42" who="S0486" trans="overlap">and when people rubbish acupuncture and that sort of erm thing</u>
<u n="43" who="S0523">yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0486">really erm they don't really know what they're talking about because that that's been practised for for many years and if it's practised properly it has a beneficial result</u>
<u n="45" who="S0523" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="46" who="S0486" trans="overlap">and a lot of erm Chinese medicine all the herbs and that sort of thing they're the origins in a lot of proprietary medicines today</u>
<u n="47" who="S0523">mm mm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0486">and that's worth erm thinking about</u>
<u n="49" who="S0523">yeah I I yeah I think there was an <trunc>a</trunc> there we had a lot <trunc>in</trunc> <trunc>ge</trunc> we were given a lot of information actually we were <trunc>e</trunc> it was very very good tour</u>
<u n="50" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0523">but I I think erm what we didn't erm er what what could've been carried on a separate talk was <pause dur="short"/> the medicine side</u>
<u n="52" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="53" who="S0523"><trunc>wi</trunc> er that was er and er the other thing was erm I felt that the <trunc>s</trunc> that the <trunc>s</trunc> do and they do an awful lot of silk printing <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="54" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh yes</u>
<u n="55" who="S0523">that that would've been er or silk erm <pause dur="short"/> er <trunc>s</trunc>silk print so that would've been quite good if they'd been able to give us a a talk about how <trunc>th</trunc> how they do all that and that would be quite good</u>
<u n="56" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> it would</u>
<u n="57" who="S0523">er we had a a talk on feng shui erm and we had lots of talks about the history but the history is so</u>
<u n="58" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="59" who="S0523">so vast that erm <pause dur="short"/> erm but anyway <trunc>o</trunc> going back to what we what er our our tour we we we <trunc>s</trunc> are are we are we okay <trunc>o</trunc> <unclear>on time</unclear>?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0486" trans="overlap">carry on <pause dur="short"/> carry on</u>
<u n="61" who="S0523">okay <pause dur="short"/> erm we had erm <vocal desc="misc"/> the we went round the summer palace and erm er <trunc>w</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> the other thing the few things that I hadn't appreciated one was just how much history there is in this in China and it it's such a big place <pause dur="short"/> the other thing was I I I I er I should've realised just how many people there are so <vocal desc="misc"/> whereas you <trunc>no</trunc>normally go to places in in Europe and you there'll be a place people from America Japan etcetera <pause dur="short"/> the the <trunc>maj</trunc> it seemed to me the majority of tourists in China were the Chinese <pause dur="short"/> so because it's one point three one point four billion the numbers of people</u>
<u n="62" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="63" who="S0523" trans="overlap">there were huge numbers of people <pause dur="short"/> that erm they erm er gosh look at that over there you see he's fallen into the water he's come right back up again gosh that's good</u>
<u n="64" who="S0486" trans="overlap"><unclear>yeah</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> well just for the tape we're sitting on the <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> and there's a party of five canoeists erm trying to go over the <anon type="place"/> erm while we're recording this erm <pause dur="short"/> this talk today erm and the <vocal desc="laugh"/> the interesting thing is that you may hear and we're in a car erm but you may hear some erm water sounds in the background and so <pause dur="short"/> while we're talking about China we're also looking at canoeists trying to get up the weir</u>
<u n="65" who="S0523">and and they're going <trunc>u</trunc> trying to go up the weir and some of them are going up and then <pause dur="short"/> they're completely going under the water and then flipping up again which is quite</u>
<u n="66" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0523">quite remarkable</u>
<u n="68" who="S0486">it is</u>
<u n="69" who="S0523">how how they're quite skilful they're holding holding their obviously holding their breaths <trunc>f</trunc> and and erm <pause dur="short"/> and <unclear>righting</unclear> themselves very quickly <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="70" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they're all erm they're actually sort of <pause dur="short"/> as you can see they're they're actually really covered in these little canoes aren't they?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0523" trans="overlap">well not <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0486">they've got these sort of like <trunc>tourniq</trunc> what do you what do you call them? they're like canvas covers that they fit round their body so that they <trunc>f</trunc></u>
<u n="73" who="S0523" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="74" who="S0486">the actual canoe is attached to their waists</u>
<u n="75" who="S0523">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0486">which is erm really interesting</u>
<u n="77" who="S0523">yeah they're they're very I don't think they'll I don't think they've got any hope of going up that weir</u>
<u n="78" who="S0486"><unclear>they <trunc>s</trunc></unclear></u>
<u n="79" who="S0523" trans="overlap">but maybe what they're trying to do is to practise <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0486">turning on a wave?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0523" trans="overlap"><trunc>t</trunc><trunc>t</trunc><trunc>tur</trunc>turning yes turning on a wave because <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>u</trunc><trunc>u</trunc><trunc>u</trunc> erm you you yeah you've gotta be able to cope with <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I've done a little bit of white water rafting and</u>
<u n="82" who="S0486">oh</u>
<u n="83" who="S0523">you you have to you have to cope with the erm the currents and the erm <pause dur="short"/> and also getting wet and then <pause dur="short"/> recovering sort of thing</u>

<u n="86" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="87" who="S0523">so so we <trunc>d</trunc> we couldn't go straight to our hotel so we we did erm erm <pause dur="short"/> we <trunc>d</trunc> went to the summer palace the first day the first day we got there <vocal desc="laugh"/> so we <trunc>str</trunc>straight away we went erm from the airport on our tour it was quite remarkable really</u>
<u n="88" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> did you?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0523" trans="overlap">we had a we had a very good flight and</u>

<u n="92" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0523">you'll see <pause dur="short"/> er the <pause dur="short"/> male lion on one side and there you'll see it see <pause dur="short"/> and you'll see <pause dur="short"/> yeah a male lion on the <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> on that side <pause dur="short"/> as on the left hand side and and then the female one is on the right and <trunc>l</trunc> you can tell the female one because she's got a a kind of baby lion er under her left or I think it's her left or right claw</u>
<u n="94" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="95" who="S0523">and and and and the <trunc>w</trunc> the way that was sort of er interpreted was that erm <pause dur="short"/> that the woman is always right you see?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="97" who="S0523"><vocal desc="laugh"/> er that was <trunc>th</trunc> our our tour manager said that's a a modern twist on the er on a very <vocal desc="laugh"/> probably on a very old theme of something</u>
<u n="98" who="S0486" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0523">er but the I mean this looks better on the erm on a on a larger screen but the the the the er decoration and everything er on on some of these things</u>
<u n="100" who="S0486" trans="overlap">describe what we're looking at here</u>
<u n="101" who="S0523" trans="overlap">it's a it's a erm <pause dur="short"/> well it's it's erm <pause dur="short"/> it's <trunc>a</trunc>ancient I dunno erm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0486" trans="overlap">portico?</u>
<u n="103" who="S0523">yeah I I think when I say ancient it's a lot of what you see in China isn't it looks old but it may not be it may be <pause dur="short"/> only in the last twenty thirty years <vocal desc="laugh"/> it might or the last fifty years because they've done such a lot of work erm er because they know history is such a a big draw to people erm and there's a lot of interest so they've <trunc>r</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc>this might be very old but it might erm a <trunc>l</trunc> er er er the British I think this is the place <pause dur="short"/> er or one of the places that when the British went to it er it might've been Beijing but they burnt a lot of er the the erm old buildings</u>

<u n="109" who="S0523">er in the nineteenth century erm <trunc>f</trunc> there's a story that he went to do business with the Chinese and the Chinese at that time were starting so <pause dur="short"/> erm oh well they'd been quite a closed country because of the big</u>

<u n="178" who="S0486">and the people who were getting married were they all Chinese?</u>
<u n="179" who="S0523">yeah yes all Chinese very <pause dur="short"/> erm we we erm we didn't see very erm the Chinese seemed to be quite erm <pause dur="short"/> sort of er kind of quite affluent er Chinese that we saw erm and er but but there are there's a big erm apparently a big dichotomy of er or split between the Chinese who live in the cities who probably compose <pause dur="short"/> I dunno twenty to thirty percent of the population</u>
<u n="180" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0523">and the the poor peasant farmer who erm comprises the most population so so the Chinese government whatever you <trunc>s</trunc> you know dispute about their erm <pause dur="short"/> their motives and everything and <pause dur="short"/> erm they have a a a major economic problem at the moment between the the people who've got erm <pause dur="short"/> er a more or more than you know are <trunc>v</trunc> pretty erm affluent erm group of people who getting well educated and all that sort of thing and then you've got the the sort of peasant farmers who who are just scraping a living it's it's a real erm they have got a real big problem so erm just as sort of an aside on that they <trunc>h</trunc> obviously <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> erm the <trunc>s</trunc> Communist Party er who <trunc>o</trunc> run China erm but you know you just think <trunc>i</trunc> that nowhere else on earth <trunc>ha</trunc> is there a government er as far as I'm aware that have to control er as much as twenty percent of the <pause dur="short"/> the er population of the world</u>
<u n="182" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="183" who="S0523">so er they have er so when it comes to erm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> quite a thought isn't it?</u>
<u n="185" who="S0523" trans="overlap">it it is it is quite a thought and it and when they when you think that erm they they're not very good on their human rights record is is is not very good at all but then erm their the history of China <trunc>ha</trunc> er as it comes over to me is that it's been pretty brutal erm er the you know <trunc>wi</trunc> er over the thousands of years that they've been erm in existence people er people've been executed and erm people there've been you know all kinds of wars and everything like that</u>
<u n="186" who="S0486" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="misc"/> mm</u>
<u n="187" who="S0523">which we in Europe have never heard of er er er and and and it's been really really brutal and</u>
<u n="188" who="S0486" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="189" who="S0523">erm if <trunc>s</trunc> you disagreed with anyone in China er the emperor would you know literally er <vocal desc="laugh"/> it seems to me have er his head would come off or something like that</u>
<u n="190" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="191" who="S0523">so so it you know? and I think erm it it might be in the erm er Chinese er psyche <trunc>psych</trunc> er psyche that er that a erm the er <pause dur="short"/> the the that that's what if there's any unrest that that they'll they deal with people very very harshly erm so erm er we we erm I don't know if you saw on the news the other night er just when we got back <vocal desc="misc"/> on the BBC news erm <pause dur="short"/> there was a <trunc>pict</trunc> there was a <trunc>f</trunc> a film on erm the BBC about president Xi visiting</u>
<u n="192" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="193" who="S0523">er <unclear>over</unclear></u>
<u n="194" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="195" who="S0523">and then they had a picture of this big church that had been erm where the people of this local I dunno town had grouped gathered together and built a big church erm erm a christian church</u>
<u n="196" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="197" who="S0523">erm and there was pictures of the congregation erm <pause dur="short"/> all <trunc>h</trunc> saying their prayers and everything like that</u>
<u n="198" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0523">and and and on one side the Chinese are are being very supportive of erm different religions and different groups</u>
<u n="200" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> mm mm</u>
<u n="201" who="S0523">but erm there was one chap <pause dur="short"/> that attached to this church who was a bit outspoken and erm and so the next picture you see is that erm the erm <pause dur="short"/> this er the <pause dur="short"/> diggers moved in</u>
<u n="202" who="S0486">oh no</u>
<u n="203" who="S0523" trans="overlap">and they they completely erm they</u>
<u n="204" who="S0486" trans="overlap">raised it to the ground did they?</u>
<u n="205" who="S0523" trans="overlap">well they didn't raise it to the ground but they broke it so that the whole roof had collapsed everything had collapsed so it couldn't be used and and er so so the these Chinese people are very erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> they they they're very distrustful of any anything that sort of <trunc>chal</trunc> could challenged the erm <pause dur="short"/> the Chinese <pause dur="short"/> government's policies</u>
<u n="206" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="207" who="S0523">erm so yeah so it was quite quite quite something</u>
<u n="208" who="S0486">I mean what what would happen in our country if we we've had a lot of trouble with erm <pause dur="short"/> with people from erm other religions erm some fanatical preachers who preach</u>
<u n="209" who="S0523" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="210" who="S0486">hate and</u>
<u n="211" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="212" who="S0486">what would happen if we went and pulled down their <pause dur="short"/> their erm places of worship?</u>
<u n="213" who="S0523">I know and the the things they <trunc>g</trunc>get away with in China erm are are are amazing er the things you wouldn't you wouldn't get away with it here erm their their planning laws I don't I think are <vocal desc="laugh"/> non existent cos they if they er the er Party the Communist Party say that's the way it should be then that's the way it should be erm</u>
<u n="214" who="S0486">yeah we're very tolerant in this country I mean at the moment erm <pause dur="short"/> we went to <anon type="place"/> at the weekend and we were absolutely amazed we got on the tube and there wasn't one person on the tube who I would say was of British origin</u>
<u n="215" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="216" who="S0486">IE everyone was talking in a foreign language</u>
<u n="217" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="218" who="S0486">erm <pause dur="short"/> you know <trunc>u</trunc> it didn't matter what what <trunc>col</trunc> what what colour they were they were all talking in a foreign language there were Chinese there were Romanians there were all sorts of Eastern Europeans erm and then people who are obviously foreign because they're a slightly different colour</u>
<u n="219" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="220" who="S0486">erm <pause dur="short"/> but the whole of the the carriages in every tube that we we travelled in they were none of them <trunc>w</trunc>were what you could call originally typically English which makes one feel like an ethnic minority in your own country</u>
<u n="221" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="222" who="S0486">but there you go that's how the world is now erm but you know a lot of places wouldn't tolerate that I mean Hungary doesn't tolerate it <pause dur="short"/> erm and erm <vocal desc="misc"/> but we do</u>
<u n="223" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="224" who="S0486">and in in a way erm <trunc>i</trunc><trunc>i</trunc> our country can't take much more of this saturation from other countries erm</u>
<u n="225" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="226" who="S0486">because we're going to use lose our our language as it stands now is going to be lost completely it's gonna go erm because all these other languages coming in are going to completely change it</u>
<u n="227" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="228" who="S0486">erm so I just wanted to say that we did find it rather disconcerting</u>
<u n="229" who="S0523">mm on the other hand you see in China that that if if if any group you know gets gets looks like it's getting the upper hand it it's it's suppressed <pause dur="short"/> erm vigorously and erm but that <trunc>c</trunc> in you know history tells us that where groups are suppressed over long periods of time</u>
<u n="230" who="S0486">oh yes</u>
<u n="231" who="S0523">eventually <pause dur="short"/> erm it it it could lead to an overthrow erm situation which erm which erm <pause dur="short"/> one chap said one one guide said he said look we we might not we we <pause dur="short"/> we are <pause dur="short"/> most people a lot of people belong to the Communist Party but not everyone</u>
<u n="232" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="233" who="S0523">but he said just look <trunc>a</trunc> think of it this way if China <pause dur="short"/> ever <pause dur="short"/> er gets out of control <pause dur="short"/> and they have you have to think about who's going to feed one point four <trunc>mil</trunc> billion people <pause dur="short"/> erm who's going to do that? <pause dur="short"/> you know and we've got this immigrant crisis going on in Europe but that's could be a tiny problem relative speaking if if China ever gets out of control so so it's in <pause dur="short"/> western Europe's interest to <pause dur="short"/> if you like keep the state maintain the status quo in in China erm if they <pause dur="short"/> can can do all the things like feed the people erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>b</trunc> <trunc>prov</trunc>provide erm <trunc>ec</trunc> growth erm and keep the erm <pause dur="short"/> er the er environmental issues under control then then you know <vocal desc="laugh"/> you you you're you're <trunc>g</trunc> you're getting sort of like <pause dur="short"/> six seven or eight out of ten you might not be getting you know ten out of ten but you're <trunc>get</trunc></u>
<u n="234" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="235" who="S0523">so so erm</u>
<u n="236" who="S0486">I can see what you're saying I mean it would be an absolutely enormous problem and then</u>
<u n="237" who="S0523" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="238" who="S0486">what would we do? erm but then you know we're only a small country England and we're not responsible for the erm problems of all these</u>

<u n="240" who="S0486">enormous countries that have got plenty of space they may not have the resources there to maintain people but they have plenty of space there for people to grow food surely and to but and to make <pause dur="short"/> and to make a life</u>
<u n="241" who="S0523">well</u>
<u n="242" who="S0486">whereas we haven't got <trunc>hardl</trunc></u>

<u n="255" who="S0523" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="256" who="S0486">erm or something you know erm</u>
<u n="257" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="258" who="S0486">German food is is erm <pause dur="short"/> really <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>n</trunc> quite plain verging on the erm <pause dur="short"/> almost like the British food in a way erm <pause dur="short"/> but you know <pause dur="short"/> and also and people say erm the Italian <trunc>di</trunc>diet's the best well actually <pause dur="short"/> you know in England if you'll if you eat English food properly you're eating <pause dur="short"/> you know vegetables and</u>
<u n="259" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="260" who="S0486">a lot of vegetables</u>
<u n="261" who="S0523">mm mm</u>
<u n="262" who="S0486">and in the old days nobody could afford very much meat</u>
<u n="263" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="264" who="S0486">so it was potatoes and and vegetables</u>
<u n="265" who="S0523" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="266" who="S0486">and that's what people had and that's very healthy</u>
<u n="267" who="S0523">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> but but China I mean it's it's it's erm I I think I read that it's agricultural er because there's a huge mountain range and so it's got a lot of desert there there isn't <trunc>mu</trunc> lot of agricultural land so it's it's up to them to to develop their economy so they can buy in er food stuffs so they buy in dried milk en masse apparently New Zealand since I've been there er has changed considerably and they now instead of having lots of sheep in New Zealand which they probably still have <vocal desc="laugh"/> they also have vast dairy herds and lot of the dairy milk is converted into dry milk powder which is then shipped to China</u>
<u n="268" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="269" who="S0523">and so erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> er so that that's <trunc>th</trunc> you know some of these so the knock on effect is if you can't make it yourself you've got to buy it in</u>
<u n="270" who="S0486" trans="overlap"><trunc>b</trunc>buy it in</u>
<u n="271" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="272" who="S0486">and by converting it into erm powder powdered milk <pause dur="short"/> erm it keeps much better and it's easier to export isn't it?</u>
<u n="273" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah it is</u>
<u n="274" who="S0486">erm</u>
<u n="275" who="S0523">but just <trunc>g</trunc> er on our</u>
<u n="276" who="S0486" trans="overlap">let's have a look at that describe that photograph to me</u>
<u n="277" who="S0523">well one of the things that really hit me and erm I don't know hit hit other people but the the number of tall buildings er er that that have been built because people are flooding into into the big cities erm you've got a city such as erm <pause dur="short"/> erm a small city is three million</u>
<u n="278" who="S0486">right</u>

<u n="280" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="281" who="S0523">something it's it's you know <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's but so they haven't got places for people to live erm in a conventional way like we have round say <anon type="place"/> so they've built these massive massive and large numbers of high rise er apartments so one guy said in er <trunc>s</trunc> told us on on er at one stage he he lives with his wife and his erm erm er <pause dur="short"/> er one one daughter because of course they had the one baby rule</u>

<u n="328" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="329" who="S0523"><vocal desc="misc"/> but that <pause dur="short"/> what <trunc>chair</trunc> what Mao or his advisers did was to say erm they said all these teachers and all the er lecturers and everything like that should go to work on the fields go back to fundamentals</u>
<u n="330" who="S0486">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="331" who="S0523">and so that's what he did and he he erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> so what what <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> the the the net effect of that was that erm he just put everyone to work in the fields and on a kinda cooperative type basis <vocal desc="misc"/> but in the early sixties it had such a a detrimental impact that er three three million people died as a result of hunger and starvation</u>
<u n="332" who="S0486">oh right</u>
<u n="333" who="S0523">and er and normally in any government that would've been a er the government would've been toppled erm but he erm he er <pause dur="short"/> he managed to continue erm but when he went the next his successors have all erm er put a lot more emphasis on education</u>
<u n="334" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="335" who="S0523">and making sure people were technically qualified and all that stuff</u>

<u n="344" who="S0486" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="345" who="S0523">so this is the first time for that</u>
<u n="346" who="S0486">mm mm</u>
<u n="347" who="S0523">and there's a <trunc>l</trunc> erm but the whole thing is to get the kind of <pause dur="short"/> everything moving and er certainly you what you do see is all these factories churning out er loads of products for</u>

<u n="351" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> well it it yeah it needs to change because erm <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> because they need a younger <trunc>work</trunc> <trunc>u</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> they need more people for the workforce but also <pause dur="short"/> traditionally what used to happen erm <pause dur="short"/> was that erm <pause dur="short"/> as you had a er an extended family the the youngsters used to look after their parents or grandparents</u>
<u n="352" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="353" who="S0523">er but you might've seen on the news the other night that because <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm this is a real paradox because people are living longer <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> you you you would see the other night on TV you saw er the the small baby her mother <pause dur="short"/> her the <trunc>m</trunc> the grandmother <pause dur="short"/> but also the great grandparents</u>
<u n="354" who="S0486">right</u>

<u n="357" who="S0523">all of them yes</u>
<u n="358" who="S0486">crikey</u>
<u n="359" who="S0523">so so the the impact of that <pause dur="short"/> is is is is is quite is really <vocal desc="laugh"/> it it's not just that they need a bigger workforce</u>
<u n="360" who="S0486" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="361" who="S0523">but they need <pause dur="short"/> more people to look after the old people</u>

<u n="363" who="S0523">it's it's really it's really bizarre</u>

<u n="584" who="S0486">mm mm</u>
<u n="585" who="S0523">and they haven't got space erm to do activities</u>
<u n="586" who="S0486">yeah</u>

<u n="594" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="595" who="S0523">and and they it it's <trunc>ch</trunc> just changes colour all the time it'd be better in a</u>
<u n="596" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="597" who="S0523">in a in a video but it's it was quite something <pause dur="short"/> so you can see all the different colours</u>
<u n="598" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah some beautiful colours</u>
<u n="599" who="S0523">yeah they're it's all you know it's all electronic and all that sort of thing but the statues here that they've created are are very artistic and erm they're very erm then we went to erm a water <trunc>s</trunc> a a water symphony</u>
<u n="600" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="601" who="S0523">where basically you have lots of erm waterfalls</u>

<u n="604" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh lovely</u>
<u n="605" who="S0523">it's really quite quite impressive you know it's erm</u>
<u n="606" who="S0486">was there evening entertainments you had to <trunc>tr</trunc> buy tickets for or was that just there anyway?</u>
<u n="607" who="S0523" trans="overlap">er that was there you just</u>
<u n="608" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="609" who="S0523">turned it we <trunc>dr</trunc> er the the the coach just took us there and</u>
<u n="610" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="611" who="S0523">dropped us off and then we just erm er yeah it's it's <pause dur="short"/> it's very good <pause dur="short"/> you can see all the it's <pause dur="short"/> erm some people <trunc>i</trunc><trunc>i</trunc> they had security there because some people the some of the youngsters wanted to dash between the the the <vocal desc="laugh"/> the jets</u>
<u n="612" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="613" who="S0523">but the the security people just didn't want them to do that</u>
<u n="614" who="S0486">no</u>
<u n="615" who="S0523">cos I imagine it's health and safety as well actually <pause dur="short"/> but it's all <pause dur="short"/> the <trunc>ligh</trunc> you know the lighting the the the lighting is quite</u>
<u n="616" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="617" who="S0523">quite <pause dur="long"/> lots of neon <pause dur="short"/> and <trunc>the</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> yes <unclear>we were</unclear></u>
<u n="618" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh you can stand in a terracotta army uniform and have your photograph taken</u>
<u n="619" who="S0523"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="620" who="S0486">that's amazing</u>
<u n="621" who="S0523">yeah I didn't think I I perhaps er <pause dur="short"/> it was funny <pause dur="short"/> the <trunc>w</trunc> but <pause dur="short"/> the what they were doing here it was it was a bit of a sell but</u>
<u n="622" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="623" who="S0523">it was basically erm how er you could you could how the terracotta army people were made</u>
<u n="624" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="625" who="S0523">and and what you realise is just how much skill</u>
<u n="626" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="627" who="S0523">goes into just making one terracotta army</u>
<u n="628" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="629" who="S0523">and then of course you've got the the terracotta army this is the ovens that they they use <pause dur="short"/> quite basic really and these are the the individual components <pause dur="short"/> that that go and then you could buy <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know typically erm small terracotta army <trunc>peo</trunc> figures to to take back</u>
<u n="630" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="631" who="S0523">the heads <pause dur="short"/> er and all that <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>thi</trunc> and all and then you had these sort of works of art <pause dur="short"/> you can see that like that it's really</u>
<u n="632" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="633" who="S0523">were these <trunc>ta</trunc> no actually these are look look at that knackered tables</u>
<u n="634" who="S0486">oh yes</u>
<u n="635" who="S0523">and what what they found is is when they've dug <trunc>o</trunc> dug open some of these tombs and things they've found lacquered erm the the technique of lacquering goes back erm <pause dur="short"/> oh you know <trunc>m</trunc> a lot longer than anyone <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="636" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="637" who="S0523">thought before and then and then there's the terracotta army people</u>
<u n="638" who="S0486">it's incredible that every</u>
<u n="639" who="S0523" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="640" who="S0486">single face on the terracotta army is different isn't it?</u>
<u n="641" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yes yes <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>a</trunc>absolutely yeah it is</u>
<u n="642" who="S0486">the</u>
<u n="643" who="S0523">it</u>
<u n="644" who="S0486">work that went into it</u>
<u n="645" who="S0523">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> the the the thing though that that that I couldn't quite <trunc>gra</trunc> quite <trunc>gra</trunc>grapple with was the the slightly macabre side so <vocal desc="misc"/> basically they they were arranged in the regiment so you had different regiments</u>
<u n="646" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="647" who="S0523">and then you had the central control place</u>
<u n="648" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="649" who="S0523">er so you the command and control where the generals were it was it was a complete army underground er which you probably read about but erm he also erm for his <trunc>f</trunc> er he didn't want to be without his erm his concubines in his his <trunc>l</trunc>later life</u>
<u n="650" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="651" who="S0523">so he he buried them alive underneath</u>
<u n="652" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh dear</u>
<u n="653" who="S0523">yeah yeah yeah so erm <vocal desc="laugh"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> just didn't like didn't didn't couldn't the the thought</u>
<u n="654" who="S0486">that must've been terrifying can you imagine the night before you knew you were going to be buried alive?</u>
<u n="655" who="S0523" trans="overlap">it <pause dur="short"/> it <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> I could only imagine that erm <pause dur="short"/> they were obviously they were buried with soldiers who had erm real <trunc>knive</trunc> er real er er real erm <vocal desc="misc"/> er <pause dur="short"/> what do you call it? real swords and real this and real that</u>
<u n="656" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="657" who="S0523">so so erm <pause dur="short"/> it's either that or they <pause dur="short"/> they you know they took poison or whatever who who knows but</u>
<u n="658" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right right</u>
<u n="659" who="S0523">but but the <pause dur="short"/> they they just closed the door and sealed it up <pause dur="short"/> and that's what they did with all these <trunc>place</trunc> and what's also interesting is that they they they this is only just a small a relatively small proportion</u>
<u n="660" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="661" who="S0523">of the whole thing</u>
<u n="662" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="663" who="S0523">so what they're saying is is erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> they won't erm <pause dur="short"/> develop it further <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>u</trunc> erm until they have the technology because once they open the tomb <pause dur="short"/> the air gets in</u>
<u n="664" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="665" who="S0523" trans="overlap">and and and and <trunc>th</trunc> some of these things collapse</u>
<u n="666" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="667" who="S0523">so erm er you can see all these <trunc>th</trunc>these are what they're working on at the moment <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> you can see they're quite large figures <pause dur="short"/> er <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and but you can see things have collapsed</u>
<u n="668" who="S0486">oh right</u>
<u n="669" who="S0523">because they have big wooden things <trunc>g</trunc> struts going past</u>
<u n="670" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="671" who="S0523">but as they've opened things the oxygen's got in and the whole thing's collapsed so</u>
<u n="672" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="673" who="S0523">so the what they're doing and and maybe it's maybe a cost</u>
<u n="674" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="675" who="S0523">control thing is they're waiting until erm the technology is there and then they'll open it up and these are erm <pause dur="short"/> these are <pause dur="short"/> highly <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>th</trunc>these are taken from the erm <vocal desc="misc"/> er the pits as they're called</u>
<u n="676" who="S0486">so we're looking at a picture of?</u>
<u n="677" who="S0523">of of a erm this might be <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="678" who="S0486">it's a horse?</u>
<u n="679" who="S0523">yeah a horse and I'm not sure whether he's a <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> horse and rider possibly</u>
<u n="680" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="681" who="S0523">erm but a warrior</u>
<u n="682" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="683" who="S0523">erm and I think this might be all in bronze</u>
<u n="684" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="685" who="S0523">erm but the <pause dur="short"/> if you <trunc>ju</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> as you as you'll appreciate the the the amount of erm skill</u>
<u n="686" who="S0486">mm mm</u>
<u n="687" who="S0523"><trunc>bi</trunc> this this <trunc>b</trunc> er required and the volume <pause dur="short"/> er that this required of to produce that</u>
<u n="688" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="689" who="S0523">erm <pause dur="short"/> it was <pause dur="short"/> the the theory behind all this of course was that er the the emperor always wanted to have be protected in his next life</u>
<u n="690" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="691" who="S0523">so as soon as he was about five or six years old</u>
<u n="692" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="693" who="S0523">he he <trunc>a</trunc>and this guy this emperor lived for a long period of time he erm erm he was planning for his next life</u>
<u n="694" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="695" who="S0523">so the reason why the terracotta army was there <pause dur="short"/> in such large numbers was that he had a very long life and therefore he was able to to put a lot of resources into erm er the artistry and the and the creation of the erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>h</trunc>horse the warriors</u>
<u n="696" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="697" who="S0523">the pits and everything like that <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> so erm <pause dur="short"/> so so so <trunc>th</trunc> all this has was so when he died erm er <trunc>i</trunc><trunc>i</trunc>it would all be ready for him to be put in there so</u>
<u n="698" who="S0486">oh I see</u>
<u n="699" who="S0523">erm</u>
<u n="700" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="701" who="S0523">whereas if he left it till he was you know near his end of his life <trunc>u</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc>the next emperor</u>
<u n="702" who="S0486">mm mm</u>
<u n="703" who="S0523">wouldn't be thinking about the previous emperor</u>
<u n="704" who="S0486">no of course not no</u>
<u n="705" who="S0523">he'd be he'd be spending his money on the <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="706" who="S0486">yes</u>
