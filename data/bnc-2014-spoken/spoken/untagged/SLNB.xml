<u n="1571" who="S0058">oh dear</u>
<u n="1572" who="S0179">so politics <pause dur="short"/> what does everyone think about the most talked about issue  issue which is inspire the most <trunc>vitriotri</trunc> vitriolic there we go comments on the BBC website <pause dur="short"/> raising the motorway speed limit to eighty</u>
<u n="1573" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1574" who="S0058">oh God <pause dur="short"/> I think that sound perfectly sensible <pause dur="short"/> most people</u>
<u n="1575" who="S0057">does that mean that they'll what is there currently like a limit beneath which you could get fined for driving too slowly on the motorway?</u>
<u n="1576" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="1577" who="S0057">what's that limit?</u>
<u n="1578" who="S0179">um</u>
<u n="1579" who="S0057">or does it?</u>
<u n="1580" who="S0179">anything which is deemed to be dangerous</u>
<u n="1581" who="S0057">dangerous</u>
<u n="1582" who="S0179">in the conditions</u>
<u n="1583" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="1584" who="S0179">which is at the discretion of the police officer</u>
<u n="1585" who="S0057">oh okay</u>
<u n="1586" who="S0179">in free-flowing motorway conditions is er in my professional opinion that would be definitely fifty or lower <pause dur="short"/> probably sixty or lower</u>
<u n="1587" who="S0057">mm</u>
<u n="1588" who="S0179">as in you shouldn't on a clear motorway you should be up at the limit if it's safe to do so <pause dur="short"/> but yes you should indeed be on any road <pause dur="short"/> um there's a well-known fact that you will in fact um you will fail and rightly so fail a driving test for not being within a few miles an hour of the speed limit unless there's a good reason</u>
<u n="1589" who="S0057">mm</u>
<u n="1590" who="S0058">so if you're going along at twenty unless you're behind a tractor <pause dur="short"/> cos I mean <trunc>s</trunc> it makes sense</u>
<u n="1591" who="S0179">it makes huge sense because people you are <trunc>hin</trunc> you are impeding traffic <pause dur="short"/> you're causing congestion <pause dur="short"/> and you're encouraging potentially dangerous overtakes <pause dur="short"/> and er most critically people won't be expecting you to</u>
<u n="1592" who="S0057">mm</u>
<u n="1593" who="S0179">do that speed <pause dur="short"/> therefore it's very dangerous <pause dur="short"/> cos it is hard to judge relative speeds on the motorway <pause dur="short"/> and and if someone's not paying attention behind you <pause dur="short"/> they're doing seventy <pause dur="short"/> you're doing fifty <pause dur="short"/> they'll be on you pretty damn fast</u>
<u n="1594" who="S0058">so</u>
<u n="1595" who="S0057">but er</u>
<u n="1596" who="S0058">if they raise it to eighty what will be the?</u>
<u n="1597" who="S0057">that's what I was gonna say</u>
<u n="1598" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="1599" who="S0179">well cos at the moment the er <trunc>t</trunc> in practice most people will do at least eighty on a motorway <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> the current system of speeding speed cameras slash speeding works out on the basis that it's the speed limit plus three miles an hour plus ten percent <pause dur="short"/> which on a seventy mile an hour road is eighty anyway <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and the police will <trunc>ne</trunc> never stop you for doing eighty because everyone does <pause dur="short"/> so it's not enforced <pause dur="short"/> they'll</u>
<u n="1600" who="S0057">mm</u>
<u n="1601" who="S0179">stop you for doing much more than eighty</u>
<u n="1602" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="1603" who="S0057">yeah</u>
<u n="1604" who="S0179">so you know ninety er you know eighty-five to ninety you're asking for <trunc>s</trunc> trouble <pause dur="short"/> but eighty's pretty much fine <pause dur="short"/> so it's essentially the unofficial speed limit anyway <pause dur="short"/> and people were just saying well let's just legitimize this <pause dur="short"/> the other argument for it is that um actually cars today are an awful lot safer than they used to be <pause dur="short"/> and er the</u>
<u n="1605" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="1606" who="S0179">um</u>
<u n="1607" who="S0058">yeah cos the speed limit was put in when cars weren't as safe so</u>
<u n="1608" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well it er used to be derestricted</u>
<u n="1609" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh right</u>
<u n="1610" who="S0179">that's mostly cos the cars couldn't go that fast</u>
<u n="1611" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1612" who="S0179">um <pause dur="short"/> and now they can <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> we also do have the slowest speed limit in all of Europe</u>
<u n="1613" who="S0058">do we?</u>
<u n="1614" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="1615" who="S0058">oh right</u>
<u n="1616" who="S0179">France is seventy-five <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> germany's</u>
<u n="1617" who="S0058">Germany's</u>
<u n="1618" who="S0179">er derestricted basically</u>
<u n="1619" who="S0058">yeah cos Germany's Autobahn</u>
<u n="1620" who="S0179">it's either derestricted or eighty-five</u>
<u n="1621" who="S0058">Germany you can just drive</u>

<u n="1626" who="S0058">aw</u>
<u n="1627" who="S0057">really tired</u>
<u n="1628" who="S0179">so yeah er there is a bit <pause dur="short"/> and of course the arguments against it are if you make the speed limit eighty everyone will do ninety</u>
<u n="1629" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="1630" who="S0179">um <pause dur="short"/> which I don't think is entirely true</u>
<u n="1631" who="S0057">I was gonna say <pause dur="short"/> it's like some people don't feel comfortable driving kind of at that speeds at those speeds anyway <pause dur="short"/> so if you've got</u>
<u n="1632" who="S0058">well <trunc>y</trunc></u>
<u n="1633" who="S0057">if you raise the speed limit so some people are driving at ninety <pause dur="short"/> some people driving kind of you know say they usually drive sixty on a motorway <pause dur="short"/> they might not</u>
<u n="1634" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="1635" who="S0057">feel comfortable doing seventy <pause dur="short"/> so then you've got like a big discrepancy in</u>
<u n="1636" who="S0179">well to be fair we possibly</u>
<u n="1637" who="S0058"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1638" who="S0179">oughtn't to be</u>
<u n="1639" who="S0058">but that is quite fast <pause dur="short"/> like er I don't know if people would actually</u>

<u n="1641" who="S0058">whether it would just be exactly the same as currently</u>
<u n="1642" who="S0179">I don't think it I think it would make it slightly worse <pause dur="short"/> but not that much <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I mean er the basic question is should we legitimize something which is in practice already legal</u>
<u n="1643" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="1644" who="S0179">well as it er as in practice isn't enforced <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I mean road safety charities like Brake who piss me off</u>
<u n="1645" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1646" who="S0179">say that of course you shouldn't <pause dur="short"/> speed kills <pause dur="short"/> er road safety charities like the IAM and <unclear/> actually who are competent say that no speed doesn't kill <pause dur="short"/> bad driving kills <pause dur="short"/> speed is  factor <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but I'm not sure where I stand on this <pause dur="short"/> it's very  it's very  complex</u>

<u n="1651" who="S0058">has anything happened yet? Or is there just talking about it?</u>
<u n="1652" who="S0179">oh they're gonna have a trial on the um <unclear/> road that goes from the M25 down to Dover <pause dur="short"/> um</u>

<u n="1656" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well they're just gonna see how it works <pause dur="short"/> um the um of course the other interesting point is that well actually er it's the speed limit on the dual carriageway as well <pause dur="short"/> and in <trunc>y</trunc> it should be acknowledged that motorways are far safer than dual carriageways <pause dur="short"/> and you should either raise it on a motorway or lower it on dual carriageways</u>
