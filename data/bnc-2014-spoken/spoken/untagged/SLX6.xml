<u n="260" who="S0480">I think and we used to do erm <pause dur="short"/> we used to do a <trunc>lo</trunc> a an opener a bit like the closing <unclear>ramp</unclear> but it was</u>
<u n="261" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="262" who="S0480" trans="overlap">our opener erm what was it called? tonight's <shift new="singing"/> tonight's gonna be a good good night <shift new="normal"/></u>
<u n="263" who="S0392" trans="overlap">the Black Eyed Peas <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="264" who="S0480" trans="overlap">that's it erm we do that erm just build it slowly then it just starts out with the guitar then the guitar and the keys then bass and one singer and then the drums and the other singer and then it just goes round a couple of times then it stops then we do Moves like Jagger and that was the best opener we've ever done you know the most successful one <pause dur="short"/> but yeah usually we do erm <pause dur="short"/> do a forty-five minute set</u>
<u n="265" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="266" who="S0480" trans="overlap">have a break and depending you know if we start at like nine o'clock we come off quarter to ten again</u>

<u n="269" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="270" who="S0480">so you're going on for the last one around eleven o'clock so sometimes you'll play forty-five minutes come off for five minutes</u>
<u n="271" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="272" who="S0480">just time for people to go to the toilet or whatever then get back on and do the second set</u>
<u n="273" who="S0392">yeah</u>

<u n="275" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="276" who="S0480">just depends on the night sometimes they're absolutely going mad and they don't want you to get off under any circumstances</u>

<u n="306" who="S0480">and that's a really nice chippy I would always choose to go to the <anon type="place"/> if I was buying them <pause dur="short"/> yeah it it's a lot of fun because</u>
<u n="307" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="308" who="S0480">partly the people who you're with and it's a bit of social for us <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="309" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="310" who="S0480">but the you know the payoff is people enjoying it the payoff is people getting up</u>

<u n="312" who="S0480">and dancing and erm just having a good time</u>
<u n="313" who="S0392">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it must be fun yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's that erm did you must do a similar set or even the <trunc>sa</trunc> do you all know the order that things are gonna be in?</u>
<u n="314" who="S0480">oh yeah yeah yeah we do we have a set it's changes from gig to gig</u>
<u n="315" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="316" who="S0480">so <trunc>ev</trunc> usually every gig we'll change a couple of songs we'll say okay we'll take that one out and we'll put that one in</u>
<u n="317" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="318" who="S0480">or maybe that one mm maybe we played it a bit early last time so we'll put it a bit later in the set so we we we shift stuff about but so over time it changes I mean there's some we've been playing ever since we started the <trunc>b</trunc> the band and we just play them every time</u>
<u n="319" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="320" who="S0480" trans="overlap">there's a Chuck Berry one that we do <pause dur="short"/> but we have a certain order that we play them in cos when there's six of you and you're playing sort of like rapid fire we can't you know it's not like the ceilidh where</u>
<u n="321" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="322" who="S0480">you know your mum's got to get them on the floor then she's got to get them sorted out then she's got to teach the steps</u>

<u n="324" who="S0480">we we stop one right thanks very much now the next song is one of your favourites and we're in</u>
<u n="325" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="326" who="S0480">and that so you you know you need the order to be a set order</u>
<u n="327" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="328" who="S0480">that you all know and that you all stick to cos again you know when it's in a what can be an extremely noisy environment plus the fact that with ear <trunc>ph</trunc> you know in-ear</u>
<u n="329" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="330" who="S0480" trans="overlap">monitoring you can't hear anything that isn't coming through the back through the PA system</u>
<u n="331" who="S0392"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="332" who="S0480">so it can be a bit erm you know if you say to somebody on the other side of the stage we're skipping this one and we're doing so and so and so and so the odds are they're not gonna hear and they'll just start playing the one that's on the list so <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="333" who="S0392"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah so you've are there five of you?</u>

<u n="342" who="S0480">oh <pause dur="short"/> in no I don't know let me think I think the last time we counted it up there were about fifty odd songs sort of thing</u>
<u n="343" who="S0392" trans="overlap">wow brilliant</u>
<u n="344" who="S0480">and we we're at the minute we're going through a process of weeding some out you know stuff that think oh right it's never we've played it a couple of times what we'll try and do is is play one or two each one that are hot in the charts at the time</u>
<u n="345" who="S0392">I see yeah</u>
<u n="346" who="S0480" trans="overlap">so we played a Meghan Trainor one</u>
<u n="347" who="S0392">yeah All About that Bass was it?</u>
<u n="348" who="S0480">er it it wasn't unfortunately</u>
<u n="349" who="S0392">oh right</u>
<u n="350" who="S0480" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was keen to do it but I'd never heard of it so I thought oh well I've never heard of this woman</u>
<u n="351" who="S0392"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="352" who="S0480">and then erm</u>
<u n="353" who="S0392" trans="overlap">she was she was famous for <trunc>tha</trunc> she was one of those one hit wonders where they do a second one and people buy it cos of the name on the tin and then after that</u>
<u n="354" who="S0480">yeah</u>
<u n="355" who="S0392" trans="overlap">it sort of fizzles out a bit</u>
<u n="356" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah I I I <trunc>sh</trunc> I mean alright she's still quite big in certainly in America but I suspect that in a year's time she'll have gone</u>
<u n="357" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="358" who="S0480">gone the way of a lot of similar people</u>
<u n="359" who="S0392" trans="overlap">it's like that er there's a few like er a few years ago there was a fella who called himself Passenger and he released a song and it got to number one and it was there for weeks people loved it and singing it and they kept asking him to do it and he didn't release anything else and ever since I imagine he's still doing</u>
<u n="360" who="S0480">that song <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="361" who="S0392" trans="overlap">tours and things</u>
<u n="362" who="S0480"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="365" who="S0392">yeah well he was yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="366" who="S0480">so we er you know we we'll do a song like that for a bit and if it's a really good song and people love it we'll keep it if it's just one of those throw away ones or if it doesn't work you know sometimes you put quite a lot of work into actually working up a song only to find that you play it a couple of times at a gig and it just doesn't seem to come off</u>
<u n="367" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="368" who="S0480">really all that well <pause dur="short"/> you know the er <pause dur="short"/> sometimes we we can't get the timing or the rhythm quite right or there's something lacking you know <trunc>whe</trunc> some songs are erm you know they get lots and lots of layers of synthesiser and stuff in them and it can be <pause dur="short"/> it can be hard to replicate all that on stage</u>
<u n="369" who="S0392">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="whistle"/> what kind of er ones are you doing nowadays from the from the charts?</u>

<u n="417" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="418" who="S0392">but <trunc>th</trunc>that's a <trunc>pl</trunc> oh it's a pain carrying all the bloody gear out of there cos we play</u>
<u n="419" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="420" who="S0480" trans="overlap">right in the middle of the room and you've you've either we either go out through one particular door but then we've got to walk the length of the place outside which if it's cold and wet and rainy it isn't much fun</u>
<u n="421" who="S0392"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="422" who="S0480">or we can get out another door which is closer to where we've put the vehicles but you're picking your way through the tables and people at the tables and people still <unclear/> around all over the place so you're <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know carrying heavy gear past people</u>
<u n="423" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="424" who="S0480">is er so that's the only drawback though and it's we you know and we like playing there so that's a couple of <pause dur="short"/> that's a couple of decent Christmas gigs</u>

<u n="430" who="S0480">erm</u>
<u n="431" who="S0392" trans="overlap">and then there's a grand to share between the rest of you</u>
<u n="432" who="S0480">and then there's a grand to share between the rest of us so we normally take a hundred and fifty out of it each</u>
<u n="433" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="434" who="S0480">something like that and then put the rest into the band fund</u>
<u n="435" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="436" who="S0480">and that you know that'll pay for erm pay for bits of gear sometimes if we invest in gear er it'll pay for that or it'll you know it goes for the insurance we buy our beer for rehearsals cos we always have</u>
<u n="437" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="438" who="S0480">a couple of beers at rehearsals</u>

<u n="944" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="945" who="S0392" trans="overlap">a lot easier to drive especially from <anon type="place"/> rather than <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="986" who="S0480">doing your work for you</u>
<u n="987" who="S0392">I still felt a bit more comfortable just playing out a bit up upstairs I thought there was there was nothing wrong with that the for the but yeah</u>
<u n="988" who="S0480" trans="overlap">upstairs was excellent I thought we really played well upstairs really played well</u>
<u n="989" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="990" who="S0480">I mean that's two gigs where we've just stood and played tune</u>

<u n="992" who="S0480" trans="overlap">after tune after tune after tune</u>

<u n="994" who="S0480">yeah well it's</u>
<u n="995" who="S0392" trans="overlap">you know</u>
<u n="996" who="S0480" trans="overlap">it's it's got easier for me I'm I'm far more comfortable with them now</u>
<u n="997" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="998" who="S0480">after gigging them</u>
<u n="999" who="S0392"><trunc>ye</trunc></u>
<u n="1000" who="S0480">hard</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah that Welcome Home is a crowd pleaser</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0480">oh it is</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0392">yeah I love that slidey do on it</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0480" trans="overlap">it is yeah</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0392" trans="overlap">going into the B part I just think that's <vocal desc="laugh"/> really great</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0480">oh yes</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0480">yeah I thought it needed the</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0392" trans="overlap">with the <shift new="singing"/> <unclear/> <shift new="normal"/></u>
<u n="1010" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah down to B minor</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0392" trans="overlap"><shift new="singing"/> <unclear/> <shift new="normal"/></u>
<u n="1012" who="S0480">yeah</u>

<u n="1014" who="S0480">yeah</u>
<u n="1015" who="S0392" trans="overlap">and that B minor that's a bit of a trick I put in cos I realise that if you've got a minor at the start of the second section it just sort of hits them if you know what I mean? that B minor chord hits them</u>
<u n="1016" who="S0480">it</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0392" trans="overlap">it smashes into them</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah it's almost like a key change isn't it?</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0392">yeah <pause dur="short"/> smashes at them and they just and they're just they just can't help smiling when they they don't realise that they've had that trick played on them</u>
<u n="1020" who="S0480">yeah</u>
<u n="1021" who="S0392">but in actual fact <pause dur="short"/> it's all intended <pause dur="short"/> nothing is not intended</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0480">oh so it is <trunc>int</trunc> it's er it's a deliberate trick is it to go into</u>
<u n="1023" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0480" trans="overlap">that minor? well it's clever stuff <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="1025" who="S0392"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1026" who="S0480">song writing craft</u>
<u n="1027" who="S0392">it's it it's hard though you run out of ideas all of a sudden and the next one comes along it's</u>
<u n="1028" who="S0480" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="long"/> that yeah it's good I liked the Closing Vamp as well like</u>
<u n="1029" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0480" trans="overlap">I very often get lost in it</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0392">oh</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0480" trans="overlap">for some <trunc>rea</trunc> I don't know why</u>
<u n="1033" who="S0392">it's really hard it's because the emphasis of the it's easy to play the melody where if you're accompanying it it feels like a four two four time or four four but it's in three four it's really complicated it's a whole it's a strathspey so naturally it feels like it should be in four four and then the emphasis is sometimes on the second beat of the bar but it's written in three four so it's really technically a difficult chord to <trunc>accomp</trunc> a difficult piece</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0480">to accompany</u>
<u n="1036" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah it is yeah yeah I'll have to I know you said early on it's in three four and when we played it at the end I'd forgotten that I'll I'll have to erm</u>
<u n="1037" who="S0392">yeah it sort of goes</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0480" trans="overlap">think two three</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0392" trans="overlap">one two three one two three</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0480" trans="overlap">one two three</u>
<u n="1041" who="S0392" trans="overlap">one yeah</u>
<u n="1042" who="S0480" trans="overlap">one two three one two three</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0392" trans="overlap"><shift new="singing"/> <unclear/> <shift new="normal"/></u>
<u n="1044" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0392" trans="overlap"><shift new="singing"/> <unclear/> <shift new="normal"/> like that</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0480">yeah</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0392">but that one er</u>
<u n="1048" who="S0480" trans="overlap">it was good</u>
<u n="1049" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1050" who="S0480" trans="overlap">so a lot of people came up and said how much they enjoyed it</u>
<u n="1051" who="S0392">oh good <pause dur="short"/> that Welcome Home as well it's completely when I first heard about the pentatonic scale you know er</u>
<u n="1052" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1053" who="S0392">which is really interesting really I could spend hours just talking about that itself but that's that whole piece is just based around the pentatonic scale I was sort of humming it around in my head and it sort of spat that out <pause dur="short"/> because it's really what it is it's the sort of the scale that's ingrained in our heads from the day we're born and a lot of people have said <trunc>studi</trunc></u>
<u n="1054" who="S0480" trans="overlap">is it? pentatonic yeah</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0392" trans="overlap">studies have shown that the pentatonic scale it comes up in every culture in the world independently of itself and a lot of</u>
<u n="1056" who="S0480">really?</u>
<u n="1057" who="S0392" trans="overlap">animals replicate it as well yeah and so</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0480" trans="overlap">I didn't know I didn't know that I mean</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0392" trans="overlap">which is probably another reason why it's a people enjoy it</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0480">it's a it's a it's a you know it's a guitarist's scale for <trunc>impr</trunc></u>
<u n="1061" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0480">for melodic improvisation</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0480" trans="overlap">it doesn't have any minors in does it</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0480" trans="overlap">for that sort of</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0480" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0392" trans="overlap">blues sound</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0480">or it doesn't flatten the <unclear>so it</unclear></u>
<u n="1070" who="S0392" trans="overlap">well it it sort of like you what you can get is <trunc>ev</trunc> a fifth all the fifths on top of each other they're put in order so D and the five notes above it makes A and then five notes above it makes E and then as soon as you get back round to D again you all the notes that you've come across you put them in order and it makes the pentatonic scale</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0480">mm</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0392">as well there's no semitones in it</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0480">no</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0392" trans="overlap">so in a normal scale and F sharp and G between those two you've got a semitone but if in the pentatonic scale there's none of those</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah <trunc>n</trunc> yeah they're all</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0392" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0480" trans="overlap">whole no certainly yeah</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0392">yeah whole notes are bigger if you ever get a chance and you're on the internet and you're a bit bored have a look at the er pentatonic scale I think it was a TED conference T E D conference some neuroscience conference and it's Jamaican I think he's Jamaican reggae style singer slash musicologist comes on and he does an experiment with the audience and it's really interesting and he does the pentatonic scale and he proves how it's in everyone's head and it's really good he sort of improvises around it</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0480">oh wow</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0392" trans="overlap"><trunc>j</trunc>jumps around you've got to have a look at it someone showed me it I think that's where I first learned about the pentatonic scale really but it shows you how it's well how it's just in <trunc>a</trunc> in all our heads without us realising it</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0480">I <trunc>wond</trunc> oh that's interesting it's yeah</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0392">yeah T E D er pentatonic scale that's all you really need to put in</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0480" trans="overlap">T E right I'll have a look at that that sounds interesting I I'd no idea that it was inbuilt</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0392">no you'll recognise the man I think I think he's quite well known I didn't but some said he's well known and the tune he hums along as well is actually quite catchy and quite good <pause dur="short"/> and he gets the audience to sing the chord that he's doing which is a note on the scale and he says at the end everywhere I've done that and these are not musicians in the audience they're all scientists and he says</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0392" trans="overlap">wherever I've</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0392" trans="overlap">done that it's always worked <pause dur="long"/> yeah it's a shame we never have any cash from them but you'll have to wait a few days <vocal desc="laugh"/> for that</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0480">oh well it won't hurt</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0392">I think they're just quite disorganised people to be honest</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0480">I think they erm <pause dur="short"/> they were obviously <vocal desc="laugh"/> run themselves</u>
