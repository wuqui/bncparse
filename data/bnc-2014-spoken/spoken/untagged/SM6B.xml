<u n="89" who="S0179">no</u>
<u n="90" who="S0058">no it isn't</u>
<u n="91" who="S0179">it took me nine minutes <pause dur="short"/> I'm not convinced it's closer</u>
<u n="92" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0179">it feels closer but I'm really particularly coming back <pause dur="short"/> if you stay on the bus as it goes round to the heart and get off there I think</u>
<u n="94" who="S0058">yes</u>
<u n="95" who="S0179">that's closer</u>
<u n="96" who="S0058" trans="overlap">that's closer but the not all of them do that is the thing <pause dur="short"/> because the one I the ones I come back on er at night do but then the really late ones I don't think they do</u>
<u n="97" who="S0179">I think they do <pause dur="short"/> where else do they go? Ones going <trunc>e</trunc></u>
<u n="98" who="S0058">I'm not sure cos the timetables don't seem to show that but</u>
<u n="99" who="S0179">well let's see what it does tonight</u>
<u n="100" who="S0058">in all fairness we could ask  in all fairness we could ask  the bus driver when we get on and say are you gonna go round erm</u>
<u n="101" who="S0179"><anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0058"><anon type="place"/> and then back out at the church like they're gonna know where they're going</u>
<u n="103" who="S0179" trans="overlap">no cos the one's in the morning go around the other way <pause dur="short"/> so they start by going like <anon type="place"/> and then come back to Lower <trunc>Cam</trunc> then</u>
<u n="104" who="S0058">oh what do you mean Great then Lower?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0179">sorry yeah they go Great then Lower <pause dur="short"/> whereas the evening I think they just do Lower and not Great</u>
<u n="106" who="S0058">oh okay</u>
<u n="107" who="S0179">so they start by going that way and then come back the other way</u>
<u n="108" who="S0058">but on a night they do come in from Great though</u>
<u n="109" who="S0179">only earlier on in the night</u>
<u n="110" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's very confusing you see <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean er I think the best thing to do is ask where it goes</u>
<u n="111" who="S0179">oh yeah they do come in from Great</u>
<u n="112" who="S0058">yeah they do <pause dur="short"/> cos in the morning they come in that way to er er stop outside Morrison's cos I'm on it <pause dur="short"/> but then on a night they come in that way so I I can never work it out</u>
<u n="113" who="S0179" trans="overlap">it's so weird</u>
<u n="114" who="S0058">I always look at the timetable and then I just think it's too much effort and I don't actually care so <pause dur="short"/> erm yeah worth asking I think</u>
<u n="115" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0058">Cos I I think it is quicker from the Hub <pause dur="short"/> it's <trunc>d</trunc> it's definitely less than like nine minutes from there <pause dur="short"/> but getting off at Morrison's I'm not sure it is</u>
<u n="117" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="118" who="S0058">I'm not sure there's much in it</u>
<u n="119" who="S0179">I was paving it down <pause dur="short"/> erm I didn't</u>
<u n="120" who="S0058">really?</u>
<u n="121" who="S0179">really have enough time to look cos I had to get in and get changed sort of in  et cetera</u>
<u n="122" who="S0058">oh thank you</u>
<u n="123" who="S0179">erm <pause dur="short"/> I've taken the other one back</u>
<u n="124" who="S0058">oh bless thank you</u>
<u n="125" who="S0179">erm <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> I've <trunc>b</trunc> the main entrance to the road is still blocked</u>
<u n="126" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="127" who="S0179">but they do appear to have got paved part of it <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="128" who="S0058">awesome</u>
<u n="129" who="S0179">one can only assume that that time cos the rest of the week was actually fine</u>
<u n="130" who="S0058">ha um um I mean I'm wondering if</u>
<u n="131" who="S0179">consistently Taylor Wimpey</u>
<u n="132" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm wondering if what they actually meant in the letter was</u>
<u n="133" who="S0179">we'll be doing it throughout this time</u>
<u n="134" who="S0058">we'll be doing <pause dur="short"/> yeah exactly</u>
<u n="135" who="S0179">yeah I think</u>
<u n="136" who="S0058" trans="overlap">we <trunc>we</trunc> then we won't be there at the weekend and then we'll be there again on the twelfth is probably what they meant which is really badly um put</u>
<u n="137" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0179">oh dear</u>
<u n="140" who="S0058">oh well at least they're doing something</u>
<u n="141" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0058">ah <pause dur="short"/> I was gonna ask you to bring my inhaler <pause dur="short"/> my chest is a bit tight</u>
<u n="143" who="S0179">really?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Just a little bit yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0179">I would've brought one from work if you'd told me</u>
<u n="146" who="S0058">ha ha <pause dur="short"/> it wouldn't have been as retro as my other</u>
<u n="147" who="S0179">no it wouldn't have been <pause dur="short"/> it would have been <trunc>er</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> I still can't believe the NHS provide those <pause dur="short"/> they're so shite compared to our ones</u>
<u n="148" who="S0058" trans="overlap">are they? What like? Well yeah I mean I guess it would cost them a lot though to get anything half decent <pause dur="short"/> whereas that's presumably a very basic</u>
<u n="149" who="S0179">the one's we make aren't expensive <pause dur="short"/> they're designed to have very low component cost</u>
<u n="150" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0179">the problem is</u>
<u n="152" who="S0058" trans="overlap">and the NHS just haven't looked at them or is it that they're just not common enough?</u>
<u n="153" who="S0179">the NHS just haven't <pause dur="short"/> well they're made for specific drugs by specific pharmaceutical companies</u>
<u n="154" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="155" who="S0179">so they'll sell the drug and the device</u>
<u n="156" who="S0058">right okay</u>
<u n="157" who="S0179">erm</u>
<u n="158" who="S0058">ah so the NHS presumably couldn't just be like oh we'll just pour you a bit of our stuff in it and <pause dur="short"/> what was that? I don't know if those blue ones are used for anything other than Salbutamol <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>do</trunc> I don't</u>
<u n="159" who="S0179">what's Salbutamol?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0058">it's just the drug for like when you get asthma people</u>
<u n="161" who="S0179">right <pause dur="short"/> possibly not <pause dur="short"/> it's just very common <pause dur="short"/> um the point of our ones is two-fold <pause dur="short"/> firstly um it it uses um</u>

<u n="220" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="221" who="S0179">now you don't pay that if you get the contract <pause dur="short"/> so that'll be</u>

<u n="233" who="S0179">that's impressive</u>
<u n="234" who="S0058">it's very impressive yeah <pause dur="short"/> considering how much they you know so like twenty-five people in the class so you know five quid each is the the sort of going rate <pause dur="short"/> obviously it doesn't</u>
<u n="235" who="S0179" trans="overlap">no that's the amount the gym gets <pause dur="short"/> so that's to make you go to the gym</u>
<u n="236" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="237" who="S0179">A fraction of that will go to <trunc>the</trunc> I'd say half at most would go to the instructor</u>
<u n="238" who="S0058" trans="overlap">company <pause dur="short"/> well it's probably to the company who</u>
<u n="239" who="S0179" trans="overlap">so it will go to the company and then</u>
<u n="240" who="S0058">and then the instructor gets some of that</u>
<u n="241" who="S0179">the instructors <pause dur="short"/> yeah the instructor is probably getting like twenty thirty quid from that</u>
<u n="242" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh no entirely yeah <pause dur="short"/> um but the uni must be erm must be paying the company which is however much <pause dur="short"/> which is pretty good</u>

<u n="388" who="S0058">oh right <pause dur="short"/> so that would cut anything</u>
<u n="389" who="S0179">basically <pause dur="short"/> well not exactly but it's the most dangerous type of laser there is</u>
<u n="390" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="391" who="S0179">within that class there's possibly even not the most interesting er but the U S military has finally developed a laser which can sink a ship</u>

<u n="408" who="S0058">ah it's scary</u>
<u n="409" who="S0179">yes we we are speculating a bit for the erm what you have to sacrifice to the spirit of the laser drill in order to get it to work</u>

<u n="411" who="S0179">we've got two summer students coming</u>

<u n="434" who="S0058">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> ah I think that was a sharey thing</u>

<u n="720" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah you'd think so</u>
<u n="721" who="S0179">so er beyond an induction that could work quite nicely</u>
<u n="722" who="S0058">cool <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> he might be keen on that</u>
<u n="723" who="S0179">I can't believe they charge you thirty quid for an induction</u>
<u n="724" who="S0058">really bad</u>
<u n="725" who="S0179">it is really bad to</u>
<u n="726" who="S0058">like five minutes of someone going this is a running machine <pause dur="short"/> this is a <trunc>tre</trunc> this is a cross trainer <pause dur="short"/> these are heavy <pause dur="short"/> these are weights</u>

<u n="728" who="S0058">ha thank you ha</u>
<u n="729" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> yes well I'd say my knowledge of the functionality of these machines is severely impaired <pause dur="short"/> iE almost non-existent</u>
<u n="730" who="S0058">the which machines?</u>
<u n="731" who="S0179">any of these machines <pause dur="short"/> these gymming machines</u>
<u n="732" who="S0058">what the person giving the induction?</u>

<u n="737" who="S0179">yeah which is an <unclear/> But having got over them it's fundamentally quite nice</u>
<u n="738" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> oh my God the treadmill in the gym at work rocks when you run on it <pause dur="short"/> probably er why my foot was in a state <pause dur="short"/> probably running more on one foot than the other</u>
<u n="739" who="S0179">still good for core stability</u>
<u n="740" who="S0058">yeah well that's what I thought <pause dur="short"/> erm and</u>
<u n="741" who="S0179" trans="overlap">you're um gonna be in good shape for this ten K</u>
<u n="742" who="S0058">well yeah I'm I'm thinking I can probably do it</u>
<u n="743" who="S0179">I think you probably can <pause dur="short"/> in fact I'm sure you can</u>
<u n="744" who="S0058">ha <pause dur="short"/> it will be actually easier</u>
<u n="745" who="S0179">I'll have the crust if you don't want it</u>
<u n="746" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it will actually be easier doing um the ten K when there's things to look at because um I think I've got snow blinders from that run <pause dur="short"/> I'm running literally into a white painted wall <pause dur="short"/> could have been right up against the wall <pause dur="short"/> white wall</u>
<u n="747" who="S0179">I couldn't do that</u>
<u n="748" who="S0058">it's <trunc>reall</trunc> it was</u>
<u n="749" who="S0179">you need something to focus on I mean in the distance to maintain your balance <pause dur="short"/> that's really <pause dur="short"/> you should get them to move it</u>
<u n="750" who="S0058">oh well yeah I'm actually gonna write to them whoever runs it <pause dur="short"/> I'm not exactly sure and say one your treadmill is wonky <pause dur="short"/> get the floor fixed <pause dur="short"/> erm two <pause dur="short"/> move it so that you're not running into a white wall <pause dur="short"/> do <trunc>s</trunc> you know</u>
<u n="751" who="S0179">preferably a window or a TV screen <pause dur="short"/> at the very least something else in the gym</u>
<u n="752" who="S0058" trans="overlap">but I was wondering at <pause dur="short"/> I was wondering about them getting another TV and putting it</u>
<u n="753" who="S0179" trans="overlap">or a mirror would do</u>
<u n="754" who="S0058">Cos there's a TV but there's two there's a treadmill little window treadmill</u>
<u n="755" who="S0179">that's stupid</u>
<u n="756" who="S0058">then TV <pause dur="short"/> so if you're on the treadmill's you if you wanna look at the TV you're like that and <trunc>th</trunc> that's why I was on that treadmill in front of the wall rather than that one because on this one you you you your kind of attention's drawn <pause dur="short"/> whereas that you know the far one you're further</u>
<u n="757" who="S0179">that sounds utterly ridiculous</u>
<u n="758" who="S0058">it is ridiculous yeah</u>
<u n="759" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">alright guys <pause dur="short"/> how was that?</u>

<u n="764" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">yeah  what you normally get when you come here <pause dur="short"/> we've not had the chicken wings unfortunately for a while but a lot of people are enjoying the ribs</u>
<u n="765" who="S0058">yeah they're good</u>
<u n="766" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">but what the thing is we forgot erm cos we've been having them for so long we forgot to tell those customers on Saturday so we had a couple of people say obviously</u>
<u n="767" who="S0058">oh right</u>
<u n="768" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">cos I suppose if you're expecting chicken and you don't like pork then</u>
<u n="769" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="779" who="S0058" trans="overlap">I was gonna say yeah <pause dur="short"/> there should be a little exchange service in a restaurant <pause dur="short"/> if you order sort of a meal which has a bit that you don't like you can swap it</u>
<u n="780" who="S0179">I do <pause dur="short"/> it's you</u>
<u n="781" who="S0058">oh fair enough <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> but yeah no it's a ridiculous gym <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>

<u n="784" who="S0179">you</u>
<u n="785" who="S0058">no it's it's really good actually</u>
<u n="786" who="S0179">you see that's what I said about our at that stupid meeting when we should be at work <pause dur="short"/> er can you just keep shifting round a bit cos otherwise it's difficult to talk to you</u>
<u n="787" who="S0058">I know <pause dur="short"/> I'm trying to stretch my legs out</u>
<u n="788" who="S0179">erm</u>
<u n="789" who="S0058">yes erm</u>
<u n="790" who="S0179">erm because</u>
<u n="791" who="S0058">that would have been so much better</u>
<u n="792" who="S0179">well no I just suggested a free weights gym <pause dur="short"/> so a bench you know a couple of bars <pause dur="short"/> a  machine if we're feeling like if we're feeling you know expansive <pause dur="short"/> but that would be a sponge floor and that's about it <pause dur="short"/> and it would be a really good space because so much of TCP is men <pause dur="short"/> and most is sort of fairly active women <pause dur="short"/> actually I reckon you'd get</u>
<u n="793" who="S0058">well it could</u>
<u n="794" who="S0179">quite a lot of business done in a gym working out over lunch time</u>
<u n="795" who="S0058">could you not just stick a few cardio machines in there or would it or would that just er er make the cost?</u>
<u n="796" who="S0179">you're getting more expensive and they need to put an AC unit in there so</u>
<u n="797" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="798" who="S0179">like heavy AC</u>
<u n="799" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> ha I don't know what the CUP one's got but if the window was open we'd just suspect it might be the AC or it's warm <pause dur="short"/> ha</u>
<u n="800" who="S0179">see we've already got showers and stuff so</u>
<u n="801" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="802" who="S0179">realistically</u>
<u n="803" who="S0058">so it wouldn't actually be that much of an issue</u>
<u n="804" who="S0179">no</u>
<u n="805" who="S0058">suggest it</u>
<u n="806" who="S0179">I <trunc>did</trunc></u>

<u n="809" who="S0058">no?</u>
<u n="810" who="S0179">as evidenced by the stupid room</u>

<u n="812" who="S0179">they've probably spent quite a lot of money on</u>

<u n="818" who="S0179">well so it's got a posh coffee machine and it's not for clients and we've been told not to use for other purposes <pause dur="short"/> so it's like why?</u>
<u n="819" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> In all fairness there's a posh coffee machine in um the <unclear/> centre <pause dur="short"/> you know the sort of sports where the gym sort of is</u>
<u n="820" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="821" who="S0058">there's a posh coffee machine in there which is sort of locked so you can't use it <trunc>ex</trunc> unless you were on a training course in there <pause dur="short"/> so it's like oh ha</u>

<u n="843" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="844" who="S0179">and slightly improved efficiency in general <pause dur="short"/> but it would be nought to sixty in probably eight and a half seconds which is a second slower than the <unclear/> and it's probably subtly less efficient</u>
<u n="845" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="846" who="S0179">so is that that?</u>

<u n="1093" who="S0179">you'd be in exactly the same position doing exactly the same thing</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0058">I would be <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0179">but I can't see any of them having taken you <pause dur="short"/> because if it's experience that's holding you back not academic qualifications</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0058" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> they wouldn't no no yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean why on earth would they have needed a first in English like it wouldn't have made any sense <pause dur="short"/> there was no yeah the difference was I had didn't have experience <pause dur="short"/> that was fair enough and that was a serious deficiency</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0058">I also did go mental on <unclear/> applications</u>

<u n="1102" who="S0058">and I did that for a while <pause dur="short"/> I think I was at it for a couple of months</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0179">well no unfeasibly there's a peak in the <unclear/> jobs somewhere</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0058">it depends how broadly you look cos I was looking quite broadly but not anything <pause dur="short"/> like I was just looking for any publishing</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0179">you you weren't going into graduate schemes</u>
<u n="1106" who="S0058">any <trunc>ch</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> um I was looking for any publishing <pause dur="short"/> any kind of charity <pause dur="short"/> any college job like administration job <pause dur="short"/> erm any museum</u>
<u n="1107" who="S0179" trans="overlap">which in retrospect I think was a mistake</u>
<u n="1108" who="S0058">what a college admin job? Why?</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0179">well I dunno <pause dur="short"/> actually no that being said it would have got you er six months experience</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0058" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that was all I was thinking <pause dur="short"/> I was thinking if I can do this you know play about with databases and write some letters to people for six months</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0179">unfortunately they probably knew that</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> in all fairness all the jobs knew that <pause dur="short"/> and this was er the job I've got was one of the high level ones I applied for and maybe that was my mistake</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0179" trans="overlap">that's possibly why you got it</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> cos they were like well she actually will stay in this job for a little bit whereas I I do wonder if the admin assistant job they were just well blatantly you wanna be in publishing not in you know you're not gonna hang around</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0179" trans="overlap">yeah obviously <pause dur="short"/> and it's gonna then cost them to recruit again</u>

<u n="1119" who="S0179">because if you aim too low you won't get it</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0058">well no that that's something definitely to learn I think <pause dur="short"/> but also I didn't wanna rule things out and I <trunc>wo</trunc> I was you know I was getting interviews which was great and I was applying for quite a range <pause dur="short"/> I was applying for some really terrible ones but probably none worse than what Verity was looking at so</u>

<u n="1388" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0058">so everyone was a bit like are they actually gonna end it <pause dur="short"/> you know are they gonna do that cool thing and like not carrying on <pause dur="short"/> not having too much of a good thing you know</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0179">that's not <trunc>g</trunc> ooh Stargate Universe</u>

<u n="1392" who="S0179">that had gone downhill</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0058">yeah that wasn't stopping cos of having too much of a good thing <pause dur="short"/> that was stopping because it was a bit rubbish</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0179">I don't know who what writers were doing</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0058">the writers probably knew they weren't gonna be paid after the end of it so decided just to screw it over</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0058">they probably stopped putting any effort in what so ever <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I I <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="1398" who="S0179">Cos the first series was it was</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0058" trans="overlap">it was the first series was so good <pause dur="short"/> but in all fairness though how long could it go on? Having said that <unclear/> went on a long time and that was a similar kind of idea <pause dur="short"/> stuck it in the middle of space</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0179">that was very different <pause dur="short"/> that was very much a this was a cosy stuck in the middle of space where <unclear/> and that was</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no I I think that's why the first bit of Universe was so good but then once they'd got cosy it was like well this is just Voyager</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0179">and again it had run into a series of space battles and it was like</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0058">yeah it was like well this isn't very interesting <pause dur="short"/> whereas yeah the first one there was aliens <pause dur="short"/> it was just we have no water</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0179" trans="overlap">no there were aliens briefly</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0058">the blue ones?</u>
<u n="1406" who="S0179">so yeah the blue ones</u>
<u n="1407" who="S0058">yeah the they are a bit weird though because they they didn't really do <trunc>any</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> they you know it wasn't a battle <pause dur="short"/> it was just a traditional alien thing <pause dur="short"/> it was just a really weird mind thing ha</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> and that bit with the er the God planet was weird</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0058">the God? Oh the God <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah oh and then they all came back to the</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="1411" who="S0058">ship <pause dur="short"/> oh that was weird</u>
<u n="1412" who="S0179">that was fucking weird</u>
<u n="1413" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> not in a particularly nice way <pause dur="short"/> just in a slightly depressing upsetting way</u>
<u n="1414" who="S0179">that was kind of the point <pause dur="short"/> but it  But it  made a very interesting theological point</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0179">in that um you can believe in a higher power and they did and there was a higher power on that planet <pause dur="short"/> a lot of good it did them</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0058">I just think it's interesting how Stargate's really interested in this theology thing</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0179">well no <pause dur="short"/> it's <trunc>s</trunc> and I I I defy anyone to watch all ten series of Stargate SG-1 <pause dur="short"/> well stop</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1420" who="S0179">but I defy anyone to erm to watch that and then <trunc>be</trunc> not be able to question the the belief in a  in a  Well</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0058">it would certainly make you think about what why</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0179">well not not to be able to question the catch twenty-two in the belief of a god</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0179">what is a god except a more powerful being more knowledgeable being</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0179">in in which case that's not you know that makes us a god to a pig <pause dur="short"/> and but er the only thing that one should be able to worship or revere is supreme moral worth</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0058" trans="overlap">yeah exactly that's the difference in Stargate</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0179" trans="overlap">but in that case why would a being of supreme moral worth want us to worship them?</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0179">er er er because ultimately there that's very self-serving and they certainly could would not and could not punish you for not worshiping them cos that would</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that would go against the idea that they were worthy of worship in the first place</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0179">indeed and therefore defies the point of <pause dur="short"/> it's a very simple</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0058">it is a catch twenty-two I agree</u>
<u n="1434" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="1435" who="S0058">it's really interesting</u>
<u n="1436" who="S0179">well it amazes me how many very intelligent people don't understand that <pause dur="short"/> anyway</u>
<u n="1437" who="S0058">but yeah anyway no er er I agree like Universe was great but then it kind of went a bit <pause dur="short"/> I think that's the thing though we were watching the second series and we were both a bit like oh this is really disappointing <pause dur="short"/> but it's better than it being amazing till the end and then knowing it wasn't gonna finish <pause dur="short"/> at least this way we were like well it's never gonna end but it was also a bit rubbish ha</u>
<u n="1438" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="1439" who="S0058">it felt a little bit</u>
<u n="1440" who="S0179">I mean unfortunately that meant that Stargate has fizzled out <pause dur="short"/> it didn't go out on a bang</u>
<u n="1441" who="S0058">Cos</u>
<u n="1442" who="S0179">it just fizzled out</u>
<u n="1443" who="S0058">yeah it it did fizzle out with <trunc>a</trunc> which is such a shame cos the first series was so good <pause dur="short"/> it could have been better than all of them you know</u>
<u n="1444" who="S0179">well no cos er they knew SG-1 was gonna stop at some point between the seventh and tenth series <pause dur="short"/> cos it</u>
<u n="1445" who="S0058" trans="overlap">what because it Richard Dean Anderson had left do you mean? Or just because?</u>
<u n="1446" who="S0179">sort of <pause dur="short"/> but also because most sci-fi series are only ever run for seven series</u>
<u n="1447" who="S0058">oh right</u>
<u n="1448" who="S0179">um none of the Star Trek</u>
<u n="1449" who="S0058" trans="overlap"><unclear/> with borrowed time</u>
<u n="1450" who="S0179">all of the Star Treks stopped after seven seasons</u>
<u n="1451" who="S0058">that's interesting <pause dur="short"/> why? Just because that was enough? Ha</u>
<u n="1452" who="S0179">arguably yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm seven years is a long time</u>
<u n="1453" who="S0058">it's a long time <pause dur="short"/> yeah I agree yeah</u>
<u n="1454" who="S0179">but erm so at the end of season seven Stargate SG-1 had a huge high budget finale episode</u>
<u n="1455" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="1456" who="S0179">that could very easily been the end <pause dur="short"/> and then they came back</u>
<u n="1457" who="S0058">should it have been the end do you think? I don't know if I've seen enough of the later ones <pause dur="short"/> was it? When did Richard Dean Anderson leave?</u>
<u n="1458" who="S0179">complicated</u>
<u n="1459" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">alright? I'll just get you a couple of small spoons <pause dur="short"/> okay?</u>

<u n="1475" who="S0179">um well it's complicated</u>
<u n="1476" who="S0058">ha ha well he's never really left</u>
<u n="1477" who="S0179">he stopped being the leader of SG-1 after season seven</u>

<u n="1479" who="S0179">he came back as the leader of the SG-C for the season eight <pause dur="short"/> hammond moved on</u>
<u n="1480" who="S0058">so <trunc>pr</trunc> was that kind of a a pretty big part then?</u>
<u n="1481" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> no um</u>
<u n="1482" who="S0058">not quite as big as SG-1 but</u>
<u n="1483" who="S0179">and the idea was that he was spending more time with his family <pause dur="short"/> he wanted to cut it down a bit</u>
<u n="1484" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> the actor? Yeah</u>
<u n="1485" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="1486" who="S0058">so <trunc>th</trunc> presumably he could rock up do a lot of his things in a shorter time period</u>
<u n="1487" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="1488" who="S0058">less location filming I guess</u>
<u n="1489" who="S0179">oh almost none</u>

<u n="1500" who="S0058">how is that executive producer isn't the same as producer <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> a producer kind of guide the direction and the feel of the piece <pause dur="short"/> you know they can be quite woollily involved</u>
<u n="1501" who="S0179">yeah but he did that for the entire series <pause dur="short"/> that's why Stargate was so much his</u>

<u n="1591" who="S0179">it's like oh the police have enough power to deal with it and should just bloody do it <pause dur="short"/> I don't understand <pause dur="short"/> if someone is stalking someone how does it get er how does er entering their house help you?</u>

<u n="1594" who="S0058">yeah that's um what I'm wondering <pause dur="short"/> it isn't it doesn't seem logical <pause dur="short"/> cos for other crimes it makes sense to be able to</u>

<u n="1599" who="S0179">well no it wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> it would just involve contacting the site administrators</u>
