<u n="69" who="S0455"><unclear/></u>
<u n="70" who="S0454">but then</u>
<u n="71" who="S0452" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="sneeze"/></u>

<u n="78" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0455">when it's cooked mm <pause dur="short"/> well you see you can either like be like dad and a lot of people are like that don't want any fat on meat</u>
<u n="80" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0455">or otherwise you like a certain amount of fat</u>
<u n="82" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0455">to to give it the flavour <pause dur="short"/> because we tried the sausages erm where there's less fat</u>
<u n="84" who="S0454" trans="overlap">less fat mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0455">and I don't think they're the same</u>
<u n="86" who="S0454">no</u>
<u n="87" who="S0455">not not a sausage</u>
<u n="88" who="S0454">that's good you're cooking even if you're not going to eat the fat it's good to leave the fat on isn't it? cos it keeps it moist</u>
<u n="89" who="S0455">yeah yes that's true</u>
<u n="90" who="S0454"><unclear>otherwise</unclear> it dries out</u>
<u n="91" who="S0455">yes <pause dur="short"/> and getting meat the way you know you personally like it is very difficult isn't it?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0455">because when we're on the cruise if you order <pause dur="short"/> lamb there it comes like a lamb chop really really rare</u>
<u n="94" who="S0454">can't you tell them?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0455">yeah I try tried so I said medium and it still er sort of came back the second time and it was still red</u>
<u n="96" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0455">and I just can't I could eat steak like that but I can't eat lamb</u>
<u n="98" who="S0454">but just say well done</u>
<u n="99" who="S0455">so well I think the <unclear/> he told us what to say if you say you don't want any red it's gotta be the easiest thing</u>
<u n="100" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="101" who="S0455">to say so it's better <unclear>now</unclear> <pause dur="long"/> but to me though that I just couldn't touch it because it looked it looked raw apart from the outside being <unclear/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0454" trans="overlap">ah right <unclear>yeah</unclear> that's no good</u>
<u n="103" who="S0455">but obviously that's how they do it in higher circles</u>
<u n="104" who="S0454">mm yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0452">and beef I think as well don't they?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0454">yes beef</u>
<u n="107" who="S0455" trans="overlap">well yes</u>
<u n="108" who="S0454">often looks like that</u>
<u n="109" who="S0452">right mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0455" trans="overlap">yeah I don't mind I like beef red</u>
<u n="111" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0455">as long as it's not absolutely raw</u>
<u n="113" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0455">but erm <unclear>no I</unclear> certainly don't like the lamb</u>
<u n="115" who="S0454">it's funny isn't it? erm with white meat you can't do that <unclear>you'd</unclear> get ill</u>
<u n="116" who="S0452">mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0455">yes <pause dur="short"/> and the thing is if you ask the it's very difficult with steak cos you can say medium rare and I always used to and a couple of times it seemed to be raw</u>
<u n="118" who="S0454">mm it varies quite a lot</u>
<u n="119" who="S0455"><trunc>s</trunc> yeah so then I've now started saying medium and then it's a bit</u>
<u n="120" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0455">hit and miss usually it's not <unclear>bad</unclear> but I'd like it a little bit less <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="long"/> and the best meat is near the bone isn't it really?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm yes it is</u>
<u n="123" who="S0455"><unclear/> it's interesting with chicken thighs you see <unclear>cos you</unclear> wouldn't touch those at all chicken thighs before and they're I think they're a little bit fatty</u>
<u n="124" who="S0452">mm yeah I I'm not so keen</u>
<u n="125" who="S0455" trans="overlap">but you don't mind them?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0452">no I'm not so keen oh well yes</u>
<u n="127" who="S0455" trans="overlap">oh er you're not?</u>
<u n="128" who="S0452">well this was erm thighs but no bones</u>
<u n="129" who="S0454">I think thighs are some of the best bits to cook with cos there's a lot of meat on them</u>
<u n="130" who="S0452">mm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0455">well I don't mind them</u>
<u n="132" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but they don't dry out as much as the breast</u>
<u n="133" who="S0452">no</u>
<u n="134" who="S0455" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="135" who="S0454">breast's quite difficult to cook because it dries out easily</u>
<u n="136" who="S0455">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0454">cos it's got no fat on it and <unclear>there's er</unclear> because you've got the bones</u>
<u n="138" who="S0455">yes</u>
<u n="139" who="S0454">actually the thighs cook quite nicely</u>
<u n="140" who="S0455">have you had my recipe for the breast stuffed with brie and mushrooms and lemon?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0454">oh yes that's nice</u>
<u n="142" who="S0455">yeah that's a good one and then wrapped in bacon</u>
<u n="143" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="144" who="S0455">and that's a lovely sort of filling meal and it does keep moist</u>
<u n="145" who="S0454">yes <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="146" who="S0455">well I did quite a nice recipe one day with those thighs I just made it up and put them in with <pause dur="short"/> erm sort of very <trunc>th</trunc> well chunks of potato and onions and tomatoes</u>
<u n="147" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="148" who="S0455">it was good</u>

<u n="646" who="S0454">the same level that you see in other countries</u>
<u n="647" who="S0455">perhaps they've gone too much on digging out the past and perhaps you need to because the person it comes to the person's mind so you've got to deal with it can't just shut it down</u>
<u n="648" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes you can't ignore it</u>
<u n="649" who="S0455">but you've gotta work through it and do some appreciation of the other things at the same time or soon afterwards</u>
