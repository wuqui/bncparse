<u n="3" who="S0172">we're having um stuffed <trunc>tomat</trunc> beef tomatoes stuffed peppers and that's it</u>
<u n="4" who="S0173">okay</u>
<u n="5" who="S0172" trans="overlap">and vegetables <pause dur="short"/> so help yourself to the vegetables</u>

<u n="7" who="S0172" trans="overlap">and there's some</u>
<u n="8" who="S0174">you won't have those will you?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0173"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Not if they've been dipped in beef</u>
<u n="10" who="S0172" trans="overlap">it didn't describe them as beef tomatoes so you're alright <pause dur="short"/> but that they look the closest thing to beef tomatoes that I can find in Waitrose</u>
<u n="11" who="S0173">well doesn't beef just mean they're really big?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0172">I think so yes <vocal desc="laugh"/> They've been beefed up <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> unless they're supposed to <trunc>s</trunc> be served with beef</u>
<u n="13" who="S0174">well <pause dur="short"/> sun's out</u>
<u n="14" who="S0172">Good</u>
<u n="15" who="S0173" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Good finally</u>
<u n="16" who="S0172">now they did <trunc>pro</trunc> it did promise some sunshine didn't it today?</u>
<u n="17" who="S0174">hm <pause dur="short"/> it did actually</u>
<u n="18" who="S0172">and it's got feta cheese with it</u>
<u n="19" who="S0173">oh <pause dur="short"/> where's the feta cheese? I can't see it</u>
<u n="20" who="S0173" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> it's in mixed in crumbled in with it in the the actual mixture of pistachio nuts <pause dur="short"/> feta cheese and herbs</u>
<u n="21" who="S0173">oh that sounds weird</u>
<u n="22" who="S0172" trans="overlap">so there's um parsley and <pause dur="short"/> can't remember what the other herb was <pause dur="short"/> but flat leaf parsley and mint <pause dur="short"/> and and</u>
<u n="23" who="S0174" trans="overlap">oregano</u>
<u n="24" who="S0172">yes there's a little but the oregano was dried <pause dur="short"/> it was in the original mixture <pause dur="short"/> otherwise I might remember some of the ingredient but I think it's <trunc>basic</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> oh and rice</u>
<u n="25" who="S0173">rice yes</u>
<u n="26" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> if the rice isn't as fluffy as it should be I'm sorry but I followed the recipe Jamie Oliver <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="27" who="S0173">Jamie Oliver?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0172" trans="overlap">should've done more or less of what he said</u>
<u n="29" who="S0173" trans="overlap">so it'll be Jamie Olivie's Oliver's book</u>
<u n="30" who="S0172">no it wasn't from a book <pause dur="short"/> it was from uh it was from the Radio Times</u>
<u n="31" who="S0173">oh okay</u>
<u n="32" who="S0172">that you get recipes from TV chefs from time to time</u>
<u n="33" who="S0173">yes <pause dur="short"/> um I've <pause dur="short"/> don't think I've made one from the Radio Times but on the BBC website they sometimes have um <pause dur="short"/> they have recipes and they're just BBC recipes but then sometimes they also have special ones from like <trunc>w</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> any of their chefs that do <trunc>sh</trunc> shows</u>
<u n="34" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="35" who="S0173">on Channel Four as well I think they do the same thing</u>
<u n="36" who="S0172" trans="overlap">well I <pause dur="short"/> yes I I've got so many cuttings of recipes that I've picked and don't <pause dur="short"/> and haven't bothered to file properly <pause dur="short"/> either from the Radio Times or from The Times newspaper but now that I've now that I don't take The Times in printed form and get it off the internet it it's easy because I what I'm doing is I've just collecting some on the my laptop in a file on the laptop</u>
<u n="37" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0172">so I just copy them <pause dur="short"/> put put them in there</u>
<u n="39" who="S0173">yes <pause dur="short"/> and then you can just</u>
<u n="40" who="S0172">and then if I  if I  think of it I can use them from there</u>
<u n="41" who="S0173" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0172">so I've got a an odd assortment <unclear/></u>
<u n="43" who="S0173" trans="overlap">uh <trunc>s</trunc> this is really nice <pause dur="short"/> I can taste the feta cheese</u>
<u n="44" who="S0172" trans="overlap">I hoped so <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh it's got the other ingredient I forgot was fresh chilli</u>
<u n="45" who="S0173">mm <pause dur="short"/> smells really good</u>
<u n="46" who="S0172">so it is quite tasty isn't it? As a result</u>
<u n="47" who="S0174">it's not bad this <pause dur="short"/> yes it's not bad</u>
<u n="48" who="S0172" trans="overlap">well <trunc>da</trunc> uh you see the thing is Dad was <trunc>sa</trunc> I mean <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I've put various ingredients in there that Dad probably wouldn't have normally <pause dur="short"/> uh</u>
<u n="49" who="S0173"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="50" who="S0174" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="51" who="S0172" trans="overlap">but the <trunc>m</trunc> the main one is actually what the vegetables are put in which is um the peppers which he wouldn't normally go for</u>
<u n="52" who="S0174" trans="overlap">nothing seems to have spoilt it</u>
<u n="53" who="S0172">Good <pause dur="short"/> well that's amazing isn't it?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0173"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="55" who="S0172">uh oh nuts is the other one that he wouldn't go for <pause dur="short"/> pistachios</u>
<u n="56" who="S0173">I haven't found any pistachios</u>
<u n="57" who="S0172" trans="overlap">well you perhaps <pause dur="short"/> I I wonder if the flavour isn't rather masked by everything else</u>
<u n="58" who="S0173" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="59" who="S0172" trans="overlap">what what you <pause dur="short"/> they were ones that were already shelled <pause dur="short"/> there's quite a a lot of them a small packet like that but I mean</u>
<u n="60" who="S0173">ooh <pause dur="short"/> I think that was one <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="61" who="S0172">right some of them <pause dur="short"/> and I had to use the pestle and mortar</u>
<u n="62" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0172">so maybe because I I was getting <pause dur="short"/> I was finding it a bit laborious using that <pause dur="short"/> I <pause dur="short"/> half of them I then put in the food <vocal desc="laugh"/> <trunc>proc</trunc> processor</u>
<u n="64" who="S0173">oh</u>
<u n="65" who="S0172">it might've ground some of them up rather a lot <pause dur="short"/> and then then you just <pause dur="short"/> um put them in the frying pan <pause dur="short"/> dry <pause dur="short"/> roast <pause dur="short"/> something</u>
<u n="66" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> did you do this morning?</u>
<u n="67" who="S0172">I did those yes <pause dur="short"/> I did that this morning yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0173">hm</u>
<u n="69" who="S0172">which was quite nice that you would <trunc>ca</trunc> in that sense that you came a bit later</u>
<u n="70" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="71" who="S0172">because it gave me time to assemble it all</u>
<u n="72" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0172" trans="overlap">but I mean I was thinking I'd have <pause dur="short"/> we'd have this evening instead of this afternoon but that's that's made it easy to do</u>
<u n="74" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0172">and leave it and I I was lucky it was something I could leave in the oven so</u>
<u n="76" who="S0173">well the reason I have to get back is because we're going to see that film <pause dur="short"/> for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</u>
<u n="77" who="S0172" trans="overlap">ah <pause dur="short"/> oh good</u>
<u n="78" who="S0173">mm</u>

<u n="84" who="S0173">he does <pause dur="short"/> he does <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Um so it's basically um the weekend and they were doing a couple of races <pause dur="short"/> I'm not really sure what this involves if uh they</u>
<u n="85" who="S0172" trans="overlap">is he a skilled uh practice sailor?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0173" trans="overlap">well <pause dur="short"/> he's done quite a bit of sailing and he's done his um oh what's it called?

<u n="91" who="S0172" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="92" who="S0173">he's done quite a bit of it though the last time he did any was almost two years ago I think <pause dur="short"/> um I would <trunc>st</trunc> or one and a half years ago <pause dur="short"/> so and the thing is the trip is free <pause dur="short"/> they pay for <pause dur="short"/> I think they pay for food and they have to pay <trunc>f</trunc> not sure if there's any equipment charge</u>
<u n="93" who="S0172" trans="overlap">why's it free? Who's supplying them?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0173" trans="overlap">I suppose they might pay <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> well it's the university sailing club</u>

<u n="588" who="S0174" trans="overlap">has sunflower hearts in it <pause dur="short"/> which are supposed to be very good for the birds <pause dur="short"/> but the birds don't seem to know that because they uh</u>

<u n="590" who="S0174">they hardly take any from that at all <pause dur="short"/> whereas the other one contains  <trunc>n</trunc> not now they've eaten them all <pause dur="short"/> and the goldfinches go for that</u>
<u n="591" who="S0173">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> you'd think they were <trunc>als</trunc> they would also be good for them</u>

<u n="597" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="598" who="S0174">on on those peanuts on the right hand side there</u>
<u n="599" who="S0173">yesterday when I was cycling from hockey it's sort of the hockey pitch I was at is off <anon type="place"/> Road</u>

<u n="603" who="S0173" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> I don't think it's by the <anon type="place"/> School I think it's it's you know <anon type="place"/> Road?</u>
<u n="604" who="S0174">and <anon type="place"/> Close the road which is the next one</u>

<u n="610" who="S0173">um and I was cycling out from it towards the road towards <anon type="place"/> Street <anon type="place"/> Road and there was um <pause dur="short"/> it was a small brown bird <pause dur="short"/> but it wasn't that small and it was running upright as if it was sort of well partridgy like</u>
<u n="611" who="S0174" trans="overlap">running along the ground?</u>
<u n="612" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="613" who="S0174">how big was it?</u>
<u n="614" who="S0173">like well it was <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing it didn't look that big to me but that's partly cos I wasn't it was quite a distance off <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I'd say sort of maybe a bit smaller than a moorhen</u>
<u n="615" who="S0174">oh no that wouldn't be a partridge</u>
<u n="616" who="S0173">well um I'm wondering what it was cos it was it didn't look as if it was sort of <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="617" who="S0172">why wouldn't that be a partridge if that?</u>
<u n="618" who="S0174">because partridges are bigger than moorhens</u>
<u n="619" who="S0172">are they?</u>
<u n="620" who="S0174">yes</u>
<u n="621" who="S0172">quail <vocal desc="laugh"/>?</u>
<u n="622" who="S0174">well quail are summer visitors</u>
<u n="623" who="S0173">it's very strange <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what it could have been <pause dur="short"/> I was thinking partridge or grouse but then I was thinking it's just in a random area</u>
<u n="624" who="S0174" trans="overlap">there wasn't um? You say it was about moorhen size?</u>
<u n="625" who="S0173">well this it's really hard to tell <pause dur="short"/> it was</u>
<u n="626" who="S0174">are there a lot of reeds and so on there?</u>
<u n="627" who="S0173">there would have been across the road cos there's that ditch the the brownish like um sort of mottled brown I would say</u>
<u n="628" who="S0174" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> and what colour was it? Did you see any details on it at all?</u>
<u n="629" who="S0173">no it was too far away <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but and and I sort of it vanished into the hedgerow and I got to that point about a few seconds later um and just sort of went looked I could see it like tearing away through the undergrowth</u>
<u n="630" who="S0174">that does sound like a partridge</u>
<u n="631" who="S0173">it <pause dur="short"/> like partridge was my first thought so</u>
<u n="632" who="S0174" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> a partridge I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I would say it's about that long a partridge</u>
<u n="633" who="S0172">it's very difficult <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's very difficult to be exact over size when you just when you have nothing to compare it with at the time</u>
<u n="634" who="S0174" trans="overlap">it is yeah <pause dur="short"/> it is <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="635" who="S0173">yeah that's the thing</u>
<u n="636" who="S0172" trans="overlap">I that's what I think</u>
<u n="637" who="S0174">well that's true even in uh experienced birdwatchers yeah</u>
<u n="638" who="S0172" trans="overlap">look I'm sorry the ice cream is beginning to run away</u>
<u n="639" who="S0174">is it? Fine <pause dur="short"/> run after it then</u>
<u n="640" who="S0173" trans="overlap">that's fine <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I like runny ice cream</u>
<u n="641" who="S0172">right <pause dur="short"/> there you are</u>
<u n="642" who="S0173">thanks</u>
<u n="643" who="S0174">ah thank you very much</u>
<u n="644" who="S0172">I think that is probably a similar amount but if you want some more of this you can have it</u>
<u n="645" who="S0174">right</u>
<u n="646" who="S0172">I'm gonna have my grapes afterwards</u>
<u n="647" who="S0173">I'm gonna have one with it <pause dur="short"/> I hope that's okay</u>
<u n="648" who="S0172">yeah well I <trunc>don</trunc> I don't think I can approve of that kind of idea</u>
<u n="649" who="S0173" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="650" who="S0172">being a purist I probably would have them afterwards <pause dur="short"/> and then the cheese after that</u>
<u n="651" who="S0173" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="652" who="S0172">or is it before that is the <trunc>t</trunc> the cheese?</u>
<u n="653" who="S0173">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Um what did you do at Granny's? Just the usual uh stuff?</u>
<u n="654" who="S0172">I think the work <pause dur="short"/> I did <pause dur="short"/> oh we had the audiologist visit and he did some fine-tuning of her hearing aids</u>
<u n="655" who="S0173">oh really?</u>
<u n="656" who="S0172" trans="overlap">which seem <pause dur="short"/> and and I bought her a telephone that amplifies the sound</u>
<u n="657" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="658" who="S0172">so that <pause dur="short"/> I mean the thing is I didn't want much <trunc>a</trunc> amplification because if she's using it with the hearing aid?</u>
<u n="659" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="660" who="S0172">she's not going to be able to alter the switch uh if she needs something as simple as possible</u>
<u n="661" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="662" who="S0172">and I don't want it to be too loud for her in that case because uh sometimes she feels as though with the hearing aids everything is really coming at her</u>
<u n="663" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="664" who="S0172">and difficult for her to cope with</u>
<u n="665" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="666" who="S0172">um <pause dur="short"/> so I got one that only amplifies up to fifteen decibels which <trunc>ama</trunc> and it amazed me that it's made enough difference for her when she's not <trunc>fear</trunc> wearing her hearing aid for her to be able to hear quite well on the phone</u>
<u n="667" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="668" who="S0172">she <trunc>c</trunc> I mean she doesn't hear that well but it's certainly a lot better than it was <pause dur="short"/> and when she's</u>
<u n="669" who="S0173">yeah I find that when I'm talking <vocal desc="laugh"/> to her on the phone</u>
<u n="670" who="S0172">yeah yes but this is with the new phone I don't</u>
<u n="671" who="S0173" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="672" who="S0172">oh you've if you spoke to her yesterday? <trunc>Fr</trunc> two days ago then she would've had the new phone so</u>
<u n="673" who="S0173">yeah she um <pause dur="short"/> she seemed to understand straight away that I was at work</u>
<u n="674" who="S0172">it's made a huge difference</u>
<u n="675" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="676" who="S0172">it's made a huge difference <trunc>u</trunc> having hearing aids of course to any conversation we have and <trunc>ma</trunc> able now to explain things in so much more detail to her</u>
<u n="677" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="678" who="S0172">unfortunately she doesn't then remember the explanation but she seems to follow it generally at the time</u>
<u n="679" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="680" who="S0172">which helps</u>
<u n="681" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that is good <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="682" who="S0172">uh so we had the audiologist and then <pause dur="short"/> on Thursday I had a phone call late morning from the duty rota organizer from <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> Link</u>
<u n="683" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="684" who="S0172">who wanted a meeting because it appears that some a couple of the carers have said they can't manage Granny</u>
<u n="685" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="686" who="S0172">with in terms of the lifting without straining themselves</u>
<u n="687" who="S0173" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="688" who="S0172">now they are not technically supposed to do any lifting <pause dur="short"/> and once it seems that once it had come to the notice of the organizer and she'd been brought to her attention then she had to something about it she was obliged to</u>
<u n="689" who="S0173" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="690" who="S0172">and basically she said that they can't now a <trunc>s</trunc> a single person on their own <trunc>i</trunc> on is is not to be put in a position where they have to take her to the toilet</u>
<u n="691" who="S0173">mhm</u>
<u n="692" who="S0172">which means now that she's got to have two visits two visitors <pause dur="short"/> not just in the morning as she has been doing but late afternoon and evening</u>
<u n="693" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="694" who="S0172">now that's alright <pause dur="short"/> obviously it's a lot more expensive but at the same time I <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I were wanting her to have a morning visit <pause dur="short"/> and I'd got Granny without persuasion particularly although I had <trunc>w</trunc> been working on her for a while and she's always rejected the idea to say yes it would be a help first thing in the morning to have someone come to make a breakfast and and see if she needs anything after the night sorting out</u>
<u n="695" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="696" who="S0172">so</u>
<u n="697" who="S0173">as in earlier than you know sort of eight o'clock yes</u>
<u n="698" who="S0172" trans="overlap">eight o'clock in the morning yes yeah that sort of time</u>
<u n="699" who="S0173">Cos what time do they normally come eleven?</u>
<u n="700" who="S0172"><trunc>E</trunc> yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> um so it's resulted in a <trunc>r</trunc> um reorganization but at the same time I I grieve that she should have the visit at eight o'clock whatever time late morning and then four o'clock and eight o'clock</u>
<u n="701" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="702" who="S0172">I was sort of pushed into um agreeing to what I agreed to with <trunc>th</trunc> there was a threat involved here that they couldn't continue to help her anymore if we didn't accept this</u>
<u n="703" who="S0173">but that's stupid though why would they say that because surely they need to <unclear/> their customers</u>
<u n="704" who="S0172" trans="overlap"><trunc>Be</trunc> <trunc>be</trunc> no <trunc>be</trunc> <trunc>be</trunc> because they <trunc>ha</trunc> they <trunc>ha</trunc> they have to look <pause dur="short"/> there's a <pause dur="short"/> the way it's put is this <pause dur="short"/> and they say their primary duty is is to the person they're caring for <pause dur="short"/> the the the the carers feel that they can't look after that person without a risk that she will fall <pause dur="short"/> be injured</u>
<u n="705" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="706" who="S0172">break her hip and that could be the end of her because people of <trunc>Gra</trunc> of Granny's that happens to  that happens to  easily</u>
<u n="707" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah true <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="708" who="S0172">um <pause dur="short"/> so so <trunc>th</trunc> there's that one and the second the other duty of course is to the carers</u>
<u n="709" who="S0173">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="710" who="S0172">who mustn't hurt their backs and so on <pause dur="short"/> but of course they sign a contract saying that they won't do the lifting</u>
<u n="711" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but the thing is that's not that's kind of not really what I mean <pause dur="short"/> what I mean is that like they should be they shouldn't be threatening you they should be making it easy for you <pause dur="short"/> you know they should be making you feel happy because you could quite easily go somewhere else <trunc>n</trunc> I don't know if there is anywhere else to go but you know</u>
<u n="712" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yes yeah <pause dur="short"/> well we're not going to</u>
<u n="713" who="S0173" trans="overlap">they shouldn't be threatening you they should be trying to come up with a solution that works for both</u>
<u n="714" who="S0172">yes <pause dur="short"/> well anyway <pause dur="short"/> we had a an interview <trunc>u</trunc> over the phone to begin with <pause dur="short"/> um <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> the person concerned um her voice really sounded hard</u>
<u n="715" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="716" who="S0172">I have met her before</u>
<u n="717" who="S0173">hard as in unfriendly</u>
<u n="718" who="S0172">um</u>
<u n="719" who="S0173">or as in difficult?</u>
<u n="720" who="S0172" trans="overlap">demanding I suppose</u>
<u n="721" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="722" who="S0172">you know she was demanding this cos she'd heard I was there</u>
<u n="723" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="724" who="S0172">when I met her face to face it was a lot better</u>
<u n="725" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="726" who="S0172">and <trunc>w</trunc> and she but she brought in one of the recent carers that's been there for about six weeks</u>
<u n="727" who="S0173" trans="overlap">mhm</u>
<u n="728" who="S0172">I think she turned out to be one of the ones that had <trunc>c</trunc> had said she couldn't she'd actually said I can't go any more unless</u>
<u n="729" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="730" who="S0172">now she's in a strong position because she's a really valued carer so it helps</u>
<u n="731" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="732" who="S0172">um so we had quite a long discussion <pause dur="short"/> with Granny there as well but I don't think Granny was following all the details you know she <trunc>w</trunc> lost concentration</u>
<u n="733" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="734" who="S0172">uh and <pause dur="short"/> she did say when I I kept on explaining the situation cos I wanted her her to be fully in the picture about what Granny's needs are so there's a lot to say</u>
<u n="735" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="736" who="S0172">and then she said well I think what's needed <trunc>i</trunc> is a lifting apparatus <pause dur="short"/> it's called a standing hoist</u>
<u n="737" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="738" who="S0172">and I've seen these because actually it turns out it was one of the apparatuses that the OT brought with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="739" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="740" who="S0172">to try for Granny <pause dur="short"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> told me since on the phone that it Granny couldn't cope with it</u>
<u n="741" who="S0173">oh really?</u>
<u n="742" who="S0172" trans="overlap">because because of the pressure on her knees from it</u>
<u n="743" who="S0173" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="744" who="S0172">but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said go ahead and let them try get the OT in and try the apparatus <pause dur="short"/> so I I did <trunc>s</trunc> but I did say um that this apparatus <trunc>th</trunc> um might not be suitable for Granny <pause dur="short"/> thing is if she has the apparatus they'll be able to <trunc>s</trunc> to revert to sending just one carer</u>
<u n="745" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="746" who="S0172">and it would be supplied free</u>
<u n="747" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="748" who="S0172">and and it sounds absolutely excellent</u>
<u n="749" who="S0173" trans="overlap">oh <unclear/> Yeah</u>
<u n="750" who="S0172">if they can get her to <trunc>s</trunc> um to use it without being injured</u>
<u n="751" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> or without if she if they can get it and use it for a start</u>
<u n="752" who="S0172" trans="overlap">it's it's well well no it's it's it's them being moved from the bed onto the chair to go into the bathroom or anything else</u>
<u n="753" who="S0173">mhm</u>
<u n="754" who="S0172">that that it it's designed for <pause dur="short"/> um it the apparently there are a lot of other kinds of apparatus as well <pause dur="short"/> so it's possible they'll find something that will work for her</u>
<u n="755" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="756" who="S0172">I don't actually in <trunc>ther</trunc> in theory why it shouldn't work why it was a problem before <pause dur="short"/> but that would obviously be a big saving cost-wise wouldn't it</u>
<u n="757" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah that'd be brilliant</u>
<u n="758" who="S0172">now I've uh had a lot of argy-bargy with with Granny as well because she's</u>
<u n="759" who="S0173" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="760" who="S0172">she's um she agreed to have a carer in first thing in the morning <pause dur="short"/> so I told <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> about this and she said right well we'll do that and we thought that maybe the lunchtime visit could be curtailed a bit in order to help defray the costs of the morning visit</u>
<u n="761" who="S0173" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="762" who="S0172">but as soon as Granny knew it was going to happen she's created <vocal desc="laugh"/> a <trunc>dr</trunc></u>
<u n="763" who="S0173" trans="overlap">what <trunc>wh</trunc></u>
<u n="764" who="S0172">she'd uh she because she had forgotten that she'd said it would be a good idea <pause dur="short"/> and the the carer came this morning it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that she knows for the first time uh she came and it was Granny clearly didn't like it</u>
<u n="765" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="766" who="S0172">uh and was difficult with her and and with complained to me afterwards and so on and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> told me on the phone that <trunc>y</trunc> you know she hinted that Granny had been difficult</u>
<u n="767" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="768" who="S0172">so that's experimental</u>
<u n="769" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="770" who="S0172">but one thing that happened that was upsetting was that she was supposed to have a visit an an evening visit with two carers coming in um at eight thirty in the evening it was scheduled for</u>
<u n="771" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="772" who="S0172">and they turned up at seven thirty</u>
<u n="773" who="S0173">oh well that's no good</u>
<u n="774" who="S0172">and Granny had only had one couple of hours before that</u>
<u n="775" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="776" who="S0172">and it was too early <pause dur="short"/> they couldn't do anything to help her at that time</u>
<u n="777" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="778" who="S0172">because she didn't need pads changing at that time <pause dur="short"/> they're supposed to be taking her to the bathroom</u>
<u n="779" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="780" who="S0172">well uh and it was upsetting for Granny <pause dur="short"/> she was also upset because there were two carers <pause dur="short"/> she she said  she said  uh two big fat women turned up</u>
<u n="781" who="S0173"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="782" who="S0172" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Um and and you know they they checked the pads and then they looked at the trolley and and I said don't touch those things more or less <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="783" who="S0173">right</u>
<u n="784" who="S0172">well if they're if that's going to happen <pause dur="short"/> if it that's less</u>
<u n="785" who="S0173" trans="overlap">did you make sure they hadn't just got the time wrong?</u>
<u n="786" who="S0172">no <pause dur="short"/> it is right that she hadn't got the time wrong</u>
<u n="787" who="S0173">no no that like the <trunc>ke</trunc> had they misunderstood</u>
<u n="788" who="S0172" trans="overlap">they well <pause dur="short"/> I checked up on this</u>
<u n="789" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="790" who="S0172">and I <trunc>conf</trunc> confirmed the time of their visit <pause dur="short"/> both <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> confirms it cos she was speaking to her Granny as they arrived</u>
<u n="791" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="792" who="S0172">and I can confirm that it had finished by ten to eight</u>
<u n="793" who="S0173">yeah but have you checked with uh <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> Link that they've got it down?</u>
<u n="794" who="S0172" trans="overlap">I have checked with <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> Link</u>
<u n="795" who="S0173"><anon type="name" nameType="n"/>e Link? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="796" who="S0172"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> Link and according to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> they should've come at eight thirty</u>
<u n="797" who="S0173">eight thirty</u>
<u n="798" who="S0172">and they came a whole hour early</u>
<u n="799" who="S0173">well at least now they know</u>
<u n="800" who="S0172" trans="overlap">so so</u>
<u n="801" who="S0173">that they've got it wrong</u>
<u n="802" who="S0172">she's <trunc>promi</trunc> she promised to tell them</u>
<u n="803" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="804" who="S0172">and last night whoever it was they came at about the right time</u>
<u n="805" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="806" who="S0172">but I've said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I <trunc>w</trunc> I I was really concerned about this cos when I realized how upset Granny was I thought well it's no good having it changed even to eight o'clock because it's too early</u>
<u n="807" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="808" who="S0172">and they they'd shifted it without shifting the afternoon visit forward</u>
<u n="809" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="810" who="S0172">so that's why the interval was completely wrong</u>
<u n="811" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="812" who="S0172">they they'd done that as a kind of makeshift I think for the moment so that this week then they could start the whole thing differently so I think Granny might get a visit at four o'clock this afternoon</u>
<u n="813" who="S0173" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="814" who="S0172">which is I've reviewed it and I've talked to Auntie <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> about it um as well <pause dur="short"/> I spent a whole night afterwards not really sleeping cos I was thinking about how to get this right sort it out</u>
<u n="815" who="S0173" trans="overlap">oh no <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="816" who="S0172">um and a whole morning trying to speak to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> the organizer cos it's difficult</u>
<u n="817" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="818" who="S0172">um uh and as a result um <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> has agreed that I think that we can revert to the <trunc>re</trunc> previous times <pause dur="short"/> although the last visit may need to be nine thirty so we'll see about that then <pause dur="short"/> it's when she's got two people who work together to contain them which is difficult</u>
<u n="819" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="820" who="S0172">but I was worried that she'd be changing a lot of carers and it would be difficult for Granny</u>
<u n="821" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="822" who="S0172">to cope with <pause dur="short"/> it's too much change all at once</u>
<u n="823" who="S0173">yeah that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> but you know it's got to happen so she'll just have to get used to it</u>
<u n="824" who="S0172">yeah but it's it's <trunc>e</trunc> it's counterproductive because she doesn't <trunc>cobr</trunc> cooperate with them when they come</u>
<u n="825" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="826" who="S0172">if she doesn't like it she doesn't</u>
<u n="827" who="S0173">she won't do it yeah</u>
<u n="828" who="S0172">and then she's in distress next day cos things weren't right and</u>
<u n="829" who="S0173">I thought you were gonna say that they that somebody had said that they can't manage her as in like she complains too much or is too difficult</u>
<u n="830" who="S0172" trans="overlap">well um I don't know</u>
<u n="831" who="S0174" trans="overlap">people are used to that</u>
<u n="832" who="S0173" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="833" who="S0172">I was saying that's there's that as well</u>

<u n="835" who="S0172">but</u>
<u n="836" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="837" who="S0172">I had to take her to the bathroom at half past ten at night</u>
<u n="838" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="839" who="S0172">get her back to bed <pause dur="short"/> try to help her with the pads afterwards <pause dur="short"/> she and I were too tired to do it</u>
<u n="840" who="S0173">mm <pause dur="short"/> you're not supposed to do it though</u>
<u n="841" who="S0172">well I don't have the proper techniques anyway</u>

<u n="845" who="S0172">I couldn't get the pads on properly for her and she was too cos she was too tired to help me by moving over</u>
<u n="846" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="847" who="S0172">so I mean I've got every sympathy with the <trunc>mi</trunc> one person doing it <pause dur="short"/> I think she is</u>
<u n="848" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="849" who="S0172">for <trunc>s</trunc> quite <pause dur="short"/> some of the carers can manage it really well really easily the really strong ones <pause dur="short"/> but they shouldn't have to they're not supposed to do it</u>
<u n="850" who="S0173" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> they shouldn't have to <pause dur="short"/> oh well <pause dur="short"/> nice grapes <pause dur="short"/> where they from?</u>

<u n="863" who="S0172">ah this is the festival we heard about is it perhaps last year and I thought Ooh there's some good things <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>

<u n="877" who="S0174">V V2s and V1s</u>
<u n="878" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> and that was the beginning of rocket technology <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="879" who="S0172" trans="overlap">is this <trunc>me</trunc> a a space sort of a British female space scientist?</u>
<u n="880" who="S0173">she's not a scientist <pause dur="short"/> she's just really enthusiastic about space <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="881" who="S0172">no it's just that there was <trunc>w</trunc> one that on interviewed on television <trunc>re</trunc> relatively recently</u>
<u n="882" who="S0173">oh that older one?</u>
<u n="883" who="S0172" trans="overlap">she's very knowledgeable</u>
<u n="884" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no it wasn't her</u>
<u n="885" who="S0172" trans="overlap">this was a young woman yeah</u>
<u n="886" who="S0173">I know what you mean of that older one <pause dur="short"/> she was um <pause dur="short"/> she hadn't she done something that was she like her invention or something or something she discovered was really important in the <trunc>seventie</trunc> I don't know</u>
<u n="887" who="S0172" trans="overlap">I don't know</u>
<u n="888" who="S0173">I don't even know who you're talking about <pause dur="short"/> anyway um</u>
<u n="889" who="S0172">not Jocelyn Bell <pause dur="short"/> I don't mean her</u>
<u n="890" who="S0173">who's <trunc>Joss</trunc>?</u>
<u n="891" who="S0172">Jocelyn Bell is an <trunc>a</trunc> oh she's an astronomer so we're not talking about</u>
<u n="892" who="S0173">anyway</u>
<u n="893" who="S0172">she <trunc>w</trunc> she's a was an old girl of my school</u>
<u n="894" who="S0173">I oh yeah no it wasn't her <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> this</u>
<u n="895" who="S0174" trans="overlap">she knows everybody <unclear/></u>
<u n="896" who="S0173">clearly <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="897" who="S0172">they're the only odd one that I think yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> I can kind of <vocal desc="laugh"/> lay claim to having known of <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="898" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="899" who="S0172" trans="overlap">that's who it is <pause dur="short"/> like Judi Dench <pause dur="short"/> to drop another name</u>
<u n="900" who="S0173">was she another old girl there?</u>
<u n="901" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="902" who="S0173">oh was she? <vocal desc="laugh"/> So anyway um yeah this woman was really good and enthusiastic but then <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> he's Professor <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> <pause dur="short"/> he was just absolutely brilliant <pause dur="short"/> he was not only really interesting in terms of what he was talking about but he was such a good speaker cos obviously he's done this a lot <pause dur="short"/> and he's also been on um TV like he was on Tomorrow's World</u>
<u n="903" who="S0172">right</u>
<u n="904" who="S0173">um cos basically his subject is um well relates to kind of paranormality and uh like why we <pause dur="short"/> he's written a book called Paranormality and basically it's discrediting all paranormality</u>
<u n="905" who="S0172">ah okay</u>
<u n="906" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so <trunc>h</trunc> it's basically his</u>
<u n="907" who="S0172" trans="overlap">there's a scientific explanation for all these things</u>
<u n="908" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> and the brain creates it like why does the brain create um what like why does the brain sort of you know spot faces spot Jesus Christ on a piece of toast or spot a demonic face in a a reflection of a stone or something like that</u>
<u n="909" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="910" who="S0173">and he was you know like his explanations he didn't go into great detail <pause dur="short"/> he just mostly did through showing us effects <pause dur="short"/> like you know there's the the uh it's basically saying what we perceive is not how the world really is um</u>
<u n="911" who="S0172" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="912" who="S0173">and um it's a sort of a survival instinct in a way because your brain couldn't possibly you know process every single thing as it is</u>
<u n="913" who="S0172" trans="overlap">I've seen that <trunc>te</trunc></u>
<u n="914" who="S0173" trans="overlap">it has to take shortcuts</u>
<u n="915" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yes there was somebody talking about that recently on TV</u>
<u n="916" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="917" who="S0172">whether it was him I don't know</u>
<u n="918" who="S0173">uh I don't know it's like um you know when you read a word the letters can be any in any order as long as the first letter and the last letter are in the right place you'll read the word</u>
<u n="919" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="920" who="S0173">um so your brain takes shortcuts all the time <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and he showed us illusions like you know the rabbit duck head thing whereas if you look at it one way it's a duck and the other way it's a rabbit?</u>
<u n="921" who="S0174">oh yes</u>
<u n="922" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="923" who="S0174">logos sometimes make use of that</u>
<u n="924" who="S0173">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="925" who="S0172">you can get books with lots of optical illusions on different pages</u>
<u n="926" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="927" who="S0174">yes</u>
<u n="928" who="S0173">it was the sort of optical illusions and also like uh picking out faces and that sort of thing he was saying that it's just what the brain does because obviously the brain uh is it's really important faces are so important for people</u>
<u n="929" who="S0172" trans="overlap">it's trying to make sense of what it sees and the sense it makes may be false sense</u>
<u n="930" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and it's just identifying</u>
<u n="931" who="S0172" trans="overlap"></u>
<u n="932" who="S0173">you know you're more likely to see a face where it's not there and it's more ecologically important economically <pause dur="short"/> sorry what am I talking about? Evolutionarily <vocal desc="laugh"/> important</u>
<u n="933" who="S0172" trans="overlap">and did he refer to so-called ghosts as a product of that kind?</u>
<u n="934" who="S0173">yes</u>
<u n="935" who="S0172">what happens though what if they appear on a photo and they we know it's not been cooked?</u>
<u n="936" who="S0173" trans="overlap">he showed us some photos <pause dur="short"/> he showed us photos um <pause dur="short"/> so like there was one where it looked like a streak of <trunc>ligh</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> it was like in an underground volt or something <pause dur="short"/> looked like a streak of light was zooming across the picture</u>
<u n="937" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="938" who="S0172">and he looked he had it for years um and sort of was looking at it thinking You know this one this one seems almost like it could be genuine <pause dur="short"/> and then his um his <trunc>c</trunc> colleague walked into his office and said what an awful photo <pause dur="short"/> and he he said <trunc>w</trunc> why do you say that? And he said well look the photographer has got his the end of his glasses in the front of the photo <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="939" who="S0172">was it streaks? Are they streaky?</u>
<u n="940" who="S0173" trans="overlap">you know if you take your pair of glasses off and it's got the little plastic coating on the bit that goes behind your ear?</u>
<u n="941" who="S0172">yes</u>
<u n="942" who="S0173">was that bit and it was like hooking round but it looked like a streaking ball of light <pause dur="short"/> but all it was it's made of like translucent orangey plastic isn't is? <trunc>Usu</trunc> often <pause dur="short"/> so the flash had gone straight through it and made it look a bit more sort of you know ghostly than it was</u>
<u n="943" who="S0172" trans="overlap">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> so when people take photos in so-called haunted houses</u>
<u n="944" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="945" who="S0172">um <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>u</trunc> very often there <trunc>so</trunc> they think they see a ghost on the photo</u>
<u n="946" who="S0173" trans="overlap">and there are like blotches of light?</u>
<u n="947" who="S0172">they haven't actually seen it themselves necessarily but <trunc>th</trunc> but it appears on the photo</u>
<u n="948" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> just the photo <pause dur="short"/> the the like there are a few there's <pause dur="short"/> cos you know if you take a camera take or set your camera to certain settings? And it blurs things and it does things</u>
<u n="949" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="950" who="S0173">like if you use the night setting when it's not night or I think if you use the <trunc>f</trunc> like sort of dusk setting <pause dur="short"/> there was one where it looked like there was a ghost of a man walking up a <trunc>p</trunc> a path <pause dur="short"/> and it was just somebody actually walking up the path but it was dark so it just it had just picked up on you know bits of it</u>
<u n="951" who="S0172">sometimes there could be have been a reflection from a window couldn't it?</u>
<u n="952" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and he showed us some things that people had genuinely posted as in sort of saying what I can't explain this thing in my photo <pause dur="short"/> and like what's that weird ghostly face? And it's like a TV set or something <trunc>reall</trunc> with a person's face on it <pause dur="short"/> it's something really stupid and really obvious <pause dur="short"/> um some of them were ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> some of them were slightly less ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> but he was basically <pause dur="short"/> he's also a magician and he started out being a magician and was like if I can fool people</u>
<u n="953" who="S0172" trans="overlap">ah <pause dur="short"/> he's interested in slight of hand</u>
<u n="954" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> if he can fool people into you know believing a coin has been passed to another hand when it hasn't <pause dur="short"/> it's just been like dropped down behind your hand</u>
<u n="955" who="S0172" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="956" who="S0173">um he <trunc>s</trunc> showed us how it's all about where you look <pause dur="short"/> like you know if you <trunc>tr</trunc> pretend to take your <trunc>coi</trunc> the coin out of one hand and it really drops <pause dur="short"/> but if you carry on staring at that hand looks suspicious <pause dur="short"/> whereas if you're looking so wherever you look the audience will look <pause dur="short"/> if you're looking where your hand is with the <trunc>wi</trunc> with the pretend coin in it then you open it and it's gone then the audience will be like <vocal desc="gasp"/> wow <pause dur="short"/> but if you if you're <trunc>look</trunc> it's your body language and your looks that what like professional stage magic is apparently <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="957" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> I read a book that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> sent me <pause dur="short"/> you know she picks out some of these unusual books</u>
<u n="958" who="S0173" trans="overlap">mhm</u>
<u n="959" who="S0172">uh and it was about part of the book was about um living alone going somewhere where you're really isolated</u>
<u n="960" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="961" who="S0172">uh <trunc>f</trunc> it might have been on an on a an <trunc>igh</trunc> small island in the Highlands and or the islands <vocal desc="laugh"/> Perhaps the island perhaps an island in Scotland opposite the coast of Scotland</u>
<u n="962" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="963" who="S0172">and she <pause dur="short"/> after she'd been there on her own for weeks and weeks she started to hear voices</u>
<u n="964" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="965" who="S0172">and she would hear them in the wind she'd just hear choruses and so on <pause dur="short"/> but she did explain it as being a product of her brain her mind because of her isolation</u>
<u n="966" who="S0173" trans="overlap">her isolation</u>
<u n="967" who="S0172">and I I sometimes connect this with Granny and her voices the voices that she apparently hears</u>
<u n="968" who="S0173" trans="overlap">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> well it's almost like if you want to hear <trunc>voic</trunc> you know you want people you want social company</u>
<u n="969" who="S0172" trans="overlap">would that be what it is? The the brain conjuring them up because it expects company</u>
<u n="970" who="S0173" trans="overlap">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> because it's either because it extracts them or because it wants them</u>
<u n="971" who="S0172">mm</u>
<u n="972" who="S0173"><trunc>U</trunc> even if you don't know you want them <pause dur="short"/> you <trunc>wa</trunc> <trunc>you</trunc> it's natural isn't it?</u>
<u n="973" who="S0172">but when I'm at Cheltenham I mean it I and I go to bed I <trunc>c</trunc> well I do I don't worry about it but cos I know what it is <pause dur="short"/> but I hear what could be footsteps</u>
<u n="974" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="975" who="S0172">but I know what it is <pause dur="short"/> I know it's creaking floorboards</u>
<u n="976" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="977" who="S0172">but it's funny how <pause dur="short"/> you know the house is just settling at that time of the night cos the heating's gone off</u>
<u n="978" who="S0173">and it's changing temperature</u>
<u n="979" who="S0172" trans="overlap">and or I've or <trunc>b</trunc> yes exactly</u>
<u n="980" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="981" who="S0172">and and or because I've just walked over them and I've shut the bedroom door and there I am</u>
<u n="982" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="983" who="S0172">but <trunc>u</trunc> but if I didn't tell myself look <pause dur="short"/> don't be silly <pause dur="short"/> you know what these are <pause dur="short"/> then I could start to worry</u>
<u n="984" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="985" who="S0172"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="986" who="S0173">that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> I mean that's um <pause dur="short"/> it's it's normal isn't it? It's like you want <pause dur="short"/> well not that you want people to be there but it's</u>
<u n="987" who="S0172">or you don't want people that <pause dur="short"/> you don't want something that's happened but you <trunc>migh</trunc> it might occur because you think about it</u>
<u n="988" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah well that's what he was saying that um</u>
<u n="989" who="S0172" trans="overlap">you you try to make <trunc>som</trunc> read interpret something as</u>
<u n="990" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="991" who="S0172"><vocal desc="laugh"/> footsteps <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="992" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing</u>
<u n="993" who="S0172">because it sounds like footsteps and your brain's heard those before and that's what they sound like</u>
<u n="994" who="S0173">but it's all just like <pause dur="short"/> everything can be explained is what his message was</u>
<u n="995" who="S0172">yes</u>
<u n="996" who="S0173" trans="overlap">basically everything can be explained</u>
<u n="997" who="S0172" trans="overlap">I <pause dur="short"/> well I think  I think  there's another possibility which is that some of these phenomena could be explained but we don't yet have the scientific means to explain them</u>
<u n="998" who="S0173">some of them yeah</u>
<u n="999" who="S0172">well let me give you an example <pause dur="short"/> and I that's what I would <trunc>s</trunc> call thought transference</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0173">he does mention that in his book</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0172" trans="overlap">what does he say about that?</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0173" trans="overlap">he didn't say <pause dur="short"/> but he flicked through all the things that people say they can't explain <pause dur="short"/> and he said that it you know it's <pause dur="short"/> he didn't okay he didn't explain it but it came up as a thing that he thought that there was an explanation for</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0172"><trunc>U</trunc> I I mean I think I just have this feeling that thought transference is an actual phenomenon</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0172">that it it can happen <pause dur="short"/> and that it could be that brainwaves can be transferred without physical contact</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0173">well I don't see why</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0172" trans="overlap">just as radio waves can be</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I don't see why that couldn't <trunc>bec</trunc> not that I know anything at all about the science but <pause dur="short"/> because if you're if things in your brain can pick up your own brain signals why can't they pick up somebody else's who's of who's close to you</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0172" trans="overlap">exactly <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0173">but then in that case why wouldn't they do it all the time?</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0172" trans="overlap">but the only <pause dur="short"/> yes but the only strange thing there is that sometimes they happen at a distance <pause dur="short"/> you get a lot of people saying that they've been at a long distance away from somebody else <pause dur="short"/> and it's somebody they were close to closely related to</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well there's the whole twin thing isn't there?</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0172">yes</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0173">you know</u>
<u n="1015" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1016" who="S0173">um <pause dur="short"/> twins seeing each other's pain and stuff</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0172" trans="overlap">loss of <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> so that's difficult to explain away</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah and there's the whole also I mean there's the whole other animals having senses that we don't have or have forgotten how to use like the elephants thing</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0172" trans="overlap">we may have them in a residual form</u>
<u n="1020" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>y</trunc> did I did you read that book? The book about the man in South Africa who ran an elephant <trunc>reser</trunc> uh like</u>
<u n="1021" who="S0172">the Elephant Whisperer?</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0173">the Elephant Whisperer yes</u>
<u n="1023" who="S0172" trans="overlap">uh I didn't read it but I heard about him recently uh only the other day</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0173">oh really? Oh what did they say about him?</u>
<u n="1025" who="S0172" trans="overlap">on TV or <trunc>u</trunc> um <pause dur="short"/> or the radio as I was travelling <pause dur="short"/> cos the radio was on as I was travelling <pause dur="short"/> he's just died</u>
<u n="1026" who="S0173" trans="overlap">did? Oh no really?</u>
<u n="1027" who="S0172">um aged sixty-one <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="1028" who="S0173" trans="overlap">how did he die?</u>
<u n="1029" who="S0172">I don't know but I don't think that's particularly significant but but after died</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0173">oh okay</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0172">and this was hadn't happened for a long time <pause dur="short"/> the elephants on the reserve where he lived um came up to the fence round the house</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0173">they knew <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1033" who="S0172">as though they were mourning him</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0173" trans="overlap">well that's what happened in the</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0172" trans="overlap">because they were so close to him</u>
<u n="1036" who="S0173">in the book it tells how he would go on international trips and when he got back they'd be waiting for him</u>
<u n="1037" who="S0172">oh you hear that about dogs don't you? A dog knows when <pause dur="short"/> and it doesn't have to be on a <trunc>re</trunc> at a regular time of day</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0172">the dog knows that that Master is returning</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0173" trans="overlap">is coming home yeah</u>
<u n="1041" who="S0172" trans="overlap">and goes there ready to greet <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> but that just might be that they have the sort of hearing that meant they they knew before anybody else did</u>
<u n="1042" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but things like elephants picking up on <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I I just don't understand <pause dur="short"/> I suppose like you know if whales can communicate over massive distances</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0172" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> hm <pause dur="short"/> yes <trunc>distan</trunc> yes huge distances yeah</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0173" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> anyway <vocal desc="laugh"/> Um well that's really sad that he died <pause dur="short"/> I was hoping he'd write another book</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0172">so it really very readable is it?</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0173">yeah</u>
