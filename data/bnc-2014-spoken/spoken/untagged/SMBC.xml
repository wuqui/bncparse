<u n="109" who="S0541">okay</u>
<u n="110" who="S0540">and you can sort of <trunc>con</trunc> er you know reduce the sort of the heaviness by not adding too much Parmesan cheese</u>
<u n="111" who="S0541">okay</u>
<u n="112" who="S0540"><vocal desc="sigh"/> but I mean risotto you know it's so simple as a recipe</u>
<u n="113" who="S0541">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0540">just <pause dur="short"/> like the you know I use the broccoli water the the stock from boiling the broccoli</u>

<u n="119" who="S0541">oh</u>
<u n="120" who="S0540">oh but I mean</u>
<u n="121" who="S0541" trans="overlap">mm</u>
