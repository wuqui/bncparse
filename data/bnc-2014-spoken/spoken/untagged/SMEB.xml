<u n="83" who="S0238">erm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0239" trans="overlap">I've only got Corn Flakes I'm afraid</u>

<u n="92" who="S0239" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah yeah sure</u>
<u n="93" who="S0238" trans="overlap">er it's not a huge amount</u>

<u n="95" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you don't need a huge amount of All-Bran but er I always carry it with me when I travel because in fact I think that's probably what I bought that little plastic thing for I take it into hotel dining rooms and mix All-Bran with the hotel's muesli and things like that <vocal desc="laugh"/> because they don't often have I mean sometimes they have Bran Flakes in this country but abroad they don't usually have it at all</u>

<u n="105" who="S0239" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0238">you can't tell without reading the the thing on the packet that says I've got quite adept at <trunc>re</trunc> at looking at how many how much fibre per hundred grams to know to be able to compare one with another</u>
<u n="107" who="S0239">oh okay oh right</u>
<u n="108" who="S0238">erm and it's surprising how quite how muesli is actually quite low</u>

<u n="115" who="S0239" trans="overlap">people think it's good but it isn't</u>
<u n="116" who="S0238" trans="overlap">twenty-four per hundred grams muesli is about six</u>
<u n="117" who="S0239">oh right okay</u>
<u n="118" who="S0238">on I mean obviously it varies depending on the muesli</u>
<u n="119" who="S0239">yeah</u>

<u n="121" who="S0239" trans="overlap">from a marking kind of er</u>

<u n="123" who="S0239">thing</u>
<u n="124" who="S0238">but a lot of the things like</u>
<u n="125" who="S0239">can you plug the toaster in there?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0238">erm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0239">shove it on there</u>

<u n="484" who="S0238">and you need as I say you learn a lot</u>
<u n="485" who="S0239" trans="overlap">I dunno if I er I dunno if I'd do it oh maybe I would <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="486" who="S0238">therefore flying and of course if you're flying from er a proper airport like that rather than a little sort of club <pause dur="short"/> you you're talking to the same control tower as all the real pilots</u>
<u n="487" who="S0239">mm</u>
<u n="488" who="S0238">so you can hear what everybody else is saying it's <trunc>re</trunc> that's really interesting as well</u>
<u n="489" who="S0239">I think they do it in Swansea that's that's Swansea Airport has closed it well well not closed but it's private again what happened was it was erm basically a private airport then some guy some entrepreneur decided he was gonna make it into a a proper airport</u>
<u n="490" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="491" who="S0239">and it was really good actually but there were some quite small planes so he advertised</u>

<u n="493" who="S0239" trans="overlap">for flight attendants that were five foot three and under</u>
<u n="494" who="S0238"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="495" who="S0239"><vocal desc="laugh"/> cos it was that that short he didn't want six foot women in you know banging their heads</u>
<u n="496" who="S0238">oh <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="497" who="S0239">so it was fun erm and then indeed they started flights they had one to Jersey one to Dublin one to Newcastle and it was going alright you know</u>
<u n="498" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="499" who="S0239">but then I <trunc>th</trunc> I think it <pause dur="short"/> it didn't quite work because it's quite far from the motorway it's the other side of Swansea see</u>
<u n="500" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="501" who="S0239">it was and people tended to just stay on the motorway and go to Cardiff</u>
<u n="502" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="503" who="S0239" trans="overlap">why I don't know cos that's quite far from the motorway as well but I guess they had more flights</u>
<u n="504" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="505" who="S0239">erm so now they just do I guess they do private plane maybe they do lessons there but they do parachuting there's always people er on a Friday you see them floating down</u>
<u n="506" who="S0238">well</u>
<u n="507" who="S0239">mm</u>
<u n="508" who="S0238">if that's something you haven't done do it</u>
<u n="509" who="S0239">parachuting?</u>
<u n="510" who="S0238">mm well I did it when I I I did one jump when I was at university</u>
<u n="511" who="S0239" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="512" who="S0238">and it was</u>

<u n="515" who="S0239">I did a tandem one</u>
<u n="516" who="S0238">I did</u>
<u n="517" who="S0239">mm</u>
<u n="518" who="S0238">a tandem paraglide off an alp erm but the problem with that was I got sick</u>
<u n="519" who="S0239">oh right</u>
<u n="520" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and I didn't actually throw up but I was feeling so ill they had to bring us down faster erm</u>
<u n="521" who="S0239">right</u>
<u n="522" who="S0238">because the Alps were sort of swinging backwards and forwards across our vision erm</u>
<u n="523" who="S0239" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="524" who="S0238">and the day before I had driven round about three mountain passes so they'd been doing I'd actually it that's one of the few times I've actually felt sick driving I mean I get sick when somebody else is driving me sometimes but</u>

<u n="529" who="S0239" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="530" who="S0238">it's er a real shame but er but interesting</u>
<u n="531" who="S0239">yeah</u>

<u n="537" who="S0239">go for it</u>
<u n="538" who="S0238">I mean it's not a cliff in the sense of there's a a ninety degree drop you're running down something that's getting steeper and steeper and steeper so you've you want to stop and he's saying you mustn't because that will bugger everything up <vocal desc="laugh"/> you've just got to keep going and it will take off <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know ah</u>

<u n="1294" who="S0238">all these people are going to have to keep their wheelie bins in the street and there was a thing on the leaflet saying don't keep it in the street but of course everybody did so the whole street had got a line of wheelie bins all the time</u>

<u n="1324" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0239">yeah so anyway we stick it out and yeah it seems a pretty good system so</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0239">mm but I mean it's taken years cos I've been recycling for donkey's years now</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0238">oh yes</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0239">before I remember taking plastic you know when I used to go to the motorway I I wouldn't make a special trip but if I was going to the motorway there was a plastic bin</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0238" trans="overlap">right cos yes a lot of places didn't have plastic for a long time</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0239">well <anon type="place"/> didn't but <anon type="place"/> did the next one along and I I'd just drop it in the <anon type="place"/> bit</u>

<u n="1333" who="S0239" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0238" trans="overlap">got a thing erm <anon type="place"/> has introduced a thing where you've got to erm to prove that you're a resident</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0239">ah okay</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0238">so obviously I don't know whether their recycling facilities was better than other people and but other people must have been using it and so they they everybody who paid council tax was sent was a form and you had to take it the next time you went to the tip</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0239">oh right</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0238">and they have you a a little sticker to keep I your car</u>

<u n="1340" who="S0238">so and you have they do check it you have to show it</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0239">ah <trunc>th</trunc>this wasn't like an organised tip the it wasn't manned you know you could just go along and and shove it in you know</u>
<u n="1342" who="S0238">right</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0239" trans="overlap">so we used to do that but but to be honest since I've had the milkman I've had so much less plastic</u>
<u n="1344" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1345" who="S0239">cos I've just mainly bottles</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0238">well you see I've got an Actimel thing every day</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0239">yeah</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0238">erm and the milk</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0239">mm</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0238">that's mostly it for plastic I mean you and you you get or washing up liquid bottles and things like that as well</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0239" trans="overlap">yeah sure yeah mm</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0238">but it's not now I've noticed that my neighbours are putting I don't know whether to say anything or not cos it sounds like you're being the rubbish police but they're putting plastic cartons in and if you look at the thing that we were sent it says</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0239">no cartons</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0238" trans="overlap">bottles not cartons</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0239">now see it doesn't say for us cos it used to say no bottles but now it doesn't say it people put everything in but I don't think the council mind cos they're they're trying to cut down on <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="1356" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I mean they're obviously having to sort if you're putting plastic and glass and metal all in one bin somebody's got to sort it anyway</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0239">mm</u>
<u n="1358" who="S0238">so it's</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0239" trans="overlap">well if</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0238">I I kind of think it's up to the council to</u>
<u n="1361" who="S0239">be clearer</u>
<u n="1362" who="S0238">decide whether they're</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0239" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0238" trans="overlap">going to put a note through their door and say oi</u>

<u n="1366" who="S0238">erm</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0239">yeah I mean with the food food waste they used to say er no oh actually it does say on there no meat no fish no plastics <pause dur="short"/> but I don't think most people are aware of that really you know people put bones in it and all sorts in there</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0238">well</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0239">which doesn't compost of course</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0238">I inherited a compost bin</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0239">mm</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0238">which I have been using but <pause dur="short"/> it's a bit unmanageable so I'm actually thinking of building myself a a compost heap as it were</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0239">mm</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0238">my dad had I mean obviously you can just have a heap of stuff but my dad actually did one with a <trunc>s</trunc> a concrete floor and raised block walls and I've got load of spare bricks cos there was a <trunc>bar</trunc> a brick built barbecue on my patio that I dismantled cos I'm never going to use it you know <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1375" who="S0239">mm</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0238">so I've got lots of bricks</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0239">oh okay</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0238">and I thought that's actually a fairly straightforward thing to do</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0239" trans="overlap">and make yourself one</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0238">but I need this is <trunc>some</trunc> one of the things on my list for for my friend <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to do he's a big bloke to to move the compost bin which I can't move so that I've got the space that I can actually start doing this</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0239">right</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0238">erm because I've got plenty of places to put compost</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0239">so they don't do erm compost waste in</u>
<u n="1384" who="S0238">no I mean I could take</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0239" trans="overlap">no they they don't do curb site for it?</u>
