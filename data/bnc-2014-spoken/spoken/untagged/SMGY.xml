<u n="15" who="S0435">we get a much more spacious sort of so the the for the amount of people there are you get a lot more space as an orchestra player than you go as a person being an actor</u>

<u n="17" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="18" who="S0436">fair enough I suppose they just have a lot of them and they have to squeeze into the dressing rooms or something don't they?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0435">and there were sofas down there</u>
<u n="20" who="S0436">sofas in the pit?</u>

<u n="26" who="S0436" trans="overlap">oh yes you said it collapsed on to the piano or</u>

<u n="35" who="S0435">er yeah I did actually</u>
<u n="36" who="S0436">lucky thing</u>
<u n="37" who="S0435">well the first violin part was much better</u>
<u n="38" who="S0436">yeah well that's what you get if you're a first violinist</u>
<u n="39" who="S0435">you get silly you get silly cadenzas and everything</u>
<u n="40" who="S0436"><vocal desc="laugh"/> where do they have silly cadenzas in Oliver?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0435">in the erm Fagin number you know the one where he just wanders around the stage</u>
<u n="42" who="S0436">oh yeah I Think I'd Better Think it Out Again</u>
<u n="43" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="44" who="S0436">I like that one</u>
<u n="45" who="S0435">and yeah <pause dur="long"/> it's when people cos we've stretched them out and shortened them a bit it was all sort of a bit conductor going no no stop and the violinists going to have to get to the end of this cadence</u>
<u n="46" who="S0436">who was the conductor?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0435">erm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0436">one of the music teachers</u>
<u n="49" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="50" who="S0436">do I know them?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0435">probably not</u>
<u n="52" who="S0436">so it wasn't they erm the lady with the loud velvet clothes</u>
<u n="53" who="S0435" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="54" who="S0436">what's she called again?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0435">Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0436">ah yes I keep on forgetting her name it sort of mentally rewrite her as our know that one with the clothes</u>
<u n="57" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="58" who="S0436">obviously they all have clothes but you know what I mean</u>
<u n="59" who="S0435">I think she did it I think she did it last year</u>
<u n="60" who="S0436">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0435">I think this is first year she hasn't done it you know</u>
<u n="62" who="S0436"><trunc>o</trunc><trunc>o</trunc>other teachings just have clothes whereas she as you know clothes</u>
<u n="63" who="S0435">yes no yeah but there was erm I'm not sure what's happening next year because the erm drama teacher who does it erm the music teacher who's who did it this year aren't going to be there so they're leaving</u>
<u n="64" who="S0436">oh they're leaving are they?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="66" who="S0436">heavens</u>
<u n="67" who="S0435">so it's all a bit of a sort of luck to what we're ending up doing I think one of the ones people think is likely to happen is Hairspray which I think it's rubbish</u>
<u n="68" who="S0436">is it? I'll admit I watched it and I now don't remember you know I watched the video thingy of it</u>
<u n="69" who="S0435">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0436">and I don't remember any of the music from it which is not a good sign no I lie I remember one bit of music from it but that's I don't remember it for being in Hairspray</u>
<u n="71" who="S0435">fair enough I don't know</u>
<u n="72" who="S0436">well</u>
<u n="73" who="S0435">I I I think there are quite a lot of things I think they ought to do but they never would cos they'll never do Sunset Boulevard quite apart from the fact it probably not fitting into their appropriate standards although they have down Oliver Miss Saigon and Les Mis so you can't really</u>
<u n="74" who="S0436">well especially Miss Saigon come on</u>
<u n="75" who="S0435" trans="overlap"> gon but erm quite apart from that nobody likes the music</u>
<u n="76" who="S0436">no I don't think that's even the problem I think the problem is it has three main roles</u>
<u n="77" who="S0435">yeah but it's got</u>
<u n="78" who="S0436" trans="overlap">and no one else gets to do anything</u>
<u n="79" who="S0435">but the chorusy bits are proper chorusy bits</u>
<u n="80" who="S0436">oh yeah but I mean there really aren't very many chorusy bits is my point</u>
<u n="81" who="S0435">yeah but I think there are ones that come up a lot worse than that in terms of nothing but solo parts</u>
<u n="82" who="S0436">yeah fair enough I wouldn't know I'm not as educated in the matter of musicals as I probably ought to be considering how much time they spend listening to them</u>
<u n="83" who="S0435">I don't know I think that</u>
<u n="84" who="S0436">your sister's useless</u>
<u n="85" who="S0435">I have an entirely different everyone else is saying even though it's probably not possible for licensing reasons everyone and their dog wants to do Wicked</u>
<u n="86" who="S0436" trans="overlap">oh this is the Wicked thing again</u>
<u n="87" who="S0435">cos I think they're making it into a film at the moment aren't they?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0436">oh yes I heard that</u>
<u n="89" who="S0435">so you won't be able to get licensing I'm sort of ninety-nine percent sure you wouldn't be able to get licensing</u>
<u n="90" who="S0436">I thought you liked it</u>
<u n="91" who="S0435">yeah well I think the best bit about it isn't the music</u>
<u n="92" who="S0436">fair enough the costuming is good</u>
<u n="93" who="S0435">the costuming and sets sort of would definitely put the music to shame</u>
<u n="94" who="S0436">yeah well it's I mean I can't judge it's it's not my style of music and frankly that sort of narrative isn't thrilling me either so yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0435" trans="overlap">and if you're going and I don't know if you're going to do tacky pop music musicals it</u>
<u n="96" who="S0436">you should do Mamma Mia <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="97" who="S0435">no no no you should do Legally Blonde cos that one's just funny that one is just it's it's ridiculously American but it's funny and it's actually got some quite music in it for being a silly pop music musical</u>
<u n="98" who="S0436">I don't understand where you developed your sudden obsession with Legally Blonde</u>
<u n="99" who="S0435">it's really it's ridiculously tacky but it's good</u>
<u n="100" who="S0436">is this your friends on the internet again?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0435">no not really</u>
<u n="102" who="S0436">or is it <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> an influence or</u>
<u n="103" who="S0435" trans="overlap">no no I don't think it ever has done</u>
<u n="104" who="S0436">well I really don't understand it then</u>
<u n="105" who="S0435">well ah <pause dur="short"/> well the one everyone likes at the moment is on the er erm internety people I know at the moment is a one a <trunc>ve</trunc>very recent one that's about Shakespeare</u>
<u n="106" who="S0436">erm a musical that's about Shakespeare</u>
<u n="107" who="S0435" trans="overlap"><trunc>sha</trunc> yes</u>
<u n="108" who="S0436">er go on you have to elaborate now</u>
<u n="109" who="S0435">I think it pretty much comes down to it it's not as in they put Shakespeare to music it's a musical about the guy Shakespeare</u>
<u n="110" who="S0436" trans="overlap">about I gathered that cos musicals based on Shakespeare plays already exist that's what you should do you should definitely put on Shakespeare for kids</u>
<u n="111" who="S0435">oh no</u>
<u n="112" who="S0436">yes</u>
<u n="113" who="S0435">I think if you're going that you ought to do</u>
<u n="114" who="S0436" trans="overlap">complete with the sheepskin costume thing</u>
<u n="115" who="S0435">no I I think they ought to do that erm the <trunc>re</trunc> the very weird musical version of Much Ado About Nothing that actually had some quite decent music</u>
<u n="116" who="S0436" trans="overlap">that's just because it has Paul Mcgann in and Paul Mcgann with not come to your school <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0435">no I I just found it hilarious that somebody did that</u>
<u n="118" who="S0436">bless you</u>
<u n="119" who="S0435">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0436">oh dear speaking of Paul Mcgann you were saying weren't you? have you heard anything more about your</u>
<u n="121" who="S0435">oh the rivers of London?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0436">yes and your optimistic</u>
<u n="123" who="S0435">but he no no no no no it's erm there's there's the it's so far there's it it has been it's a project that's being openly done by sort of said to be being done and so that's all fine cos it's erm they're sort of it's they haven't yet cast anyone or officially put down anyone's name sort of for anything in particular yet but well</u>
<u n="124" who="S0436">then personally I wouldn't put any faith in it but</u>
<u n="125" who="S0435">mm well the the fact that they've just been done very well on the erm the the the Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell television thing</u>
<u n="126" who="S0436">oh it's the same people doing it is it?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="128" who="S0436">oh fair enough oh hang on you said that before didn't you?</u>
<u n="129" who="S0435">yeah and so it's the same people doing it</u>
<u n="130" who="S0436" trans="overlap">I just wasn't listening obviously</u>
<u n="131" who="S0435">and they've had quite a lot of a success there</u>
<u n="132" who="S0436">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0435">but it's sort of still hopeful that they might it's not that they've er and it's not just that they've said oh we will do this it's a sort of they've officially put it on their website as one of the projects we're working towards so</u>
<u n="134" who="S0436" trans="overlap">mm that's <unclear>seems okay</unclear> yeah by the way when I finish that Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell ha ha she says being you know two hundred pages through it or something it's quite a dense book really I mean</u>
<u n="135" who="S0435">for something which is really not erm for kind of</u>
<u n="136" who="S0436" trans="overlap">it's kind of embarrassing to admit that but I don't know I think I've just lost the knack of reading things sort of for pleasure so many academic articles er but anyhow but anyway when I finish it would you be keen to join me in watching the television thing you know I'm no good at watching television by myself</u>
<u n="137" who="S0435">I've already watched it but I'll watch it again</u>
<u n="138" who="S0436">well that was sort of what I was asking</u>
<u n="139" who="S0435">yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0436">hang on has the final one come out already?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0435">oh yes last week or the week before or something</u>
<u n="142" who="S0436">oh fair enough I'm just behind the times aren't I? then again what else should I expect but er but anyway it was good was it?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0435">yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0436">well yeah promising</u>
<u n="145" who="S0435">you've probably come <trunc>go</trunc> across what's his name John Segundus and you have to admit he's he's he's lovely</u>
<u n="146" who="S0436">he's only been in the book a bit so far basically at the beginning</u>
<u n="147" who="S0435" trans="overlap">he never gets much further he's never a main main character but</u>
<u n="148" who="S0436">yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0435">he's he's recurring none main character</u>
<u n="150" who="S0436">he seems like one of the more decent people in it so far</u>
<u n="151" who="S0435">and what the his er hit his friend erm <unclear>Mr Honeyford</unclear></u>
<u n="152" who="S0436">oh yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0435">you know they're nice</u>
<u n="154" who="S0436">well I don't know kind of <unclear>Mr Honeyford</unclear> was a bit of a I don't know a pompous caricature kind of character but</u>
<u n="155" who="S0435" trans="overlap">yes but I think he's nice they're nicer than</u>
<u n="156" who="S0436">I suppose fundamentally I tend to go for sort of you know well meaning characters at least but there you are that's why I don't do literature course I ran off and studied medieval literature where everyone is a psychopathic murderer</u>
<u n="157" who="S0435" trans="overlap">anyone else it's only because that's what they thought was interesting</u>
<u n="158" who="S0436">erm perhaps I don't know you know in the case of Icelandic sagas you do wonder whether it's just <unclear/> I don't know you know modern Icelandic literature seems to be pretty much the same they just like reading stories about psychopathic murderers obviously</u>
<u n="159" who="S0435" trans="overlap">I think it comes from living in a country with with no sun probably I think it's a general whole different outlook on life and then it is a it's less let's look for happy things in our book and let's look for actually things happening lots of things happening cos if you if you don't actually have any sun for ninety per cent of the time you might want to spend your time being interested rather than just</u>
<u n="160" who="S0436">yeah I don't know I I like to think it's not how I'd react but then again I'm sure there are lots of lovely happy books written in Iceland and I just haven't read them but</u>
<u n="161" who="S0435">yeah but that probably comes the fact that if you if you look at the English books that are famous in other countries probably have not very many of them are sort of nice lovely happy ones</u>
<u n="162" who="S0436" trans="overlap"><unclear/> happy reads you might be right yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0435">I think you'd probably get a ridiculous</u>
<u n="164" who="S0436" trans="overlap">I've graduated I don't need to read literature</u>
<u n="165" who="S0435">you'd probably get an <trunc>un</trunc> disproportionately high amount of sort of murder mystery things and crime stuff from sort of</u>
<u n="166" who="S0436">you know I think they tended to kind of</u>
<u n="167" who="S0435">I think there's</u>
<u n="168" who="S0436">I suppose old school crime we is a thing but</u>
<u n="169" who="S0435">yes but they I think it's all sort of</u>
<u n="170" who="S0436" trans="overlap">sort of the more modern stuff</u>
<u n="171" who="S0435">mm</u>
<u n="172" who="S0436">it's all Harry Potter isn't it?</u>
<u n="173" who="S0435">I think it's probably the main one everyone's heard of</u>
<u n="174" who="S0436">I don't know lots of things sadly the rest of the world English books and we don't read theirs cos the English are too snobby to do a decent translation of foreign literature is there any particular reason why you're trying to take my hat apart?</u>
<u n="175" who="S0435">no</u>
<u n="176" who="S0436">well please don't then it's a nice hat I like it just cos you think it looks daft</u>
<u n="177" who="S0435">it does</u>
<u n="178" who="S0436">of course it looks daft it's a straw boater what did you expect?</u>
<u n="179" who="S0435">well <pause dur="short"/> I don't know I I think you can just I don't think you have learnt anything from Dirk Gently it's not trying to persuade people not to wear hats it doesn't work</u>
<u n="180" who="S0436" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> that's the only thing you learnt from Dirk Gently?</u>
<u n="181" who="S0435">I think the only real applicable life thing</u>
<u n="182" who="S0436">not even about the inventor of the cat flap?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0435">yeah possibly</u>
<u n="184" who="S0436">the difficulty of discovering gravity</u>
<u n="185" who="S0435">it had never occurred to me and I don't think I have much use for it now I know it but I would say that <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0436">dearie me <pause dur="short"/> they are funny book though aren't they?</u>
<u n="187" who="S0435">I'm still embarrassed about how long it took me to realise that erm erm in the radio adaptation what the the the guy in the second the Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul erm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0436">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0435">the guy the <trunc>wh</trunc> the married couple I can't remember their surname now</u>
<u n="190" who="S0436">oh oh</u>
<u n="191" who="S0435">Cynthia and Simon Bracock?</u>
<u n="192" who="S0436" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="misc"/> something like that</u>
<u n="193" who="S0435">that that that the guy was played by Peter Davies and it honestly didn't click</u>
<u n="194" who="S0436">oh I remember you came running up to me and squeak <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> he's Peter Davies in the <trunc>mi</trunc></u>
<u n="195" who="S0435">I never noticed</u>
<u n="196" who="S0436">erm I I suppose if I was feeling a little less charitable I'd point out he's an actor it's kind of his job to sound like different people but erm yes</u>
<u n="197" who="S0435" trans="overlap">yes but but but but I can recognise quite a lot of people in anything by their voice cos I mean you know the guy who played Vimes in erm the erm Night Watch</u>
<u n="198" who="S0436">oh yes and you heard him on the radio</u>
<u n="199" who="S0435">you can I can always tell him</u>
<u n="200" who="S0436">but he has a really distinctive voice</u>
<u n="201" who="S0435">yes but I suppose Peter Davidson doesn't have a highly highly distinctive voice but it's still not exactly generic</u>
<u n="202" who="S0436" trans="overlap">well I don't know I thought it was fairly generic whereas the the chappy you were talking about he's very distinctive cos he's one of those people like Roger Allam he's completely incapable of saying a word that doesn't sound deeply sarcastic which is I suppose why he makes such a good Vimes in the first place</u>
<u n="203" who="S0435">mm</u>
<u n="204" who="S0436">speaking of Roger Allam</u>
<u n="205" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="206" who="S0436">did you ever erm listen to the er the the the the</u>
<u n="207" who="S0435">I listened to a bit of it it was on the radio recently</u>
<u n="208" who="S0436">I didn't even say what it was</u>
<u n="209" who="S0435">yes the Les Mis</u>

<u n="211" who="S0435">I listened to a bit of it cos it was on the radio</u>
<u n="212" who="S0436">and?</u>
<u n="213" who="S0435">I think it was done quite well it's it's a really weird though because it's it sits somewhere between the book and the musical which I'm really not used to in terms of it goes into far more detail in quite a lot of bits that the the musical doesn't even notice <trunc>i</trunc> happened in the first place and then them then then then you have then you have the then it skips over massive bits in the book that I wouldn't have well maybe not massive bits but then then it sort of it goes into loads of detail about him stealing the coin from the small child and things and angsting about it for ages</u>
<u n="214" who="S0436" trans="overlap">come on that's dramatically important</u>
<u n="215" who="S0435">yes but it's dramatically important and entirely not at all present in the musical</u>
<u n="216" who="S0436">yes</u>
<u n="217" who="S0435">if you get what I mean</u>
<u n="218" who="S0436">I don't know I just</u>
<u n="219" who="S0435">but so but it's not vital to the plot but is a sort of atmosphere builder in a sense</u>
<u n="220" who="S0436">well I don't know I I'd at least rank it as characterisation</u>
<u n="221" who="S0435">okay but</u>
<u n="222" who="S0436">but go on what's what's the bit they left out?</u>
<u n="223" who="S0435">I can't remember but I seem to they they just sort of <trunc>i</trunc></u>
<u n="224" who="S0436">it's a very long novel I suppose different adaptations can make different choices</u>
<u n="225" who="S0435" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="226" who="S0436">you probably didn't get far enough into the radio adaptation to notice that it was rather sweet they basically telescoped all of the spare students into one person</u>
<u n="227" who="S0435"><vocal desc="laugh"/> which one did they name it after?</u>
<u n="228" who="S0436">er hang on it was</u>

<u n="231" who="S0436">yes which was kind of odd</u>
<u n="232" who="S0435">one of the distinctive ones to begin with wasn't he?</u>
<u n="233" who="S0436">well no that's the thing he doesn't really do much in plot term doesn't do an awful lot of plot terms but er you know sort of in the book Courfeyrac is the one who you know goes around doing stuff and rescuing lost puppy <unclear>Marios</unclear> and laughing at his terrible fashion choices and things so did they still have?</u>
<u n="234" who="S0435">So did they still have Courfeyrac?</u>
<u n="235" who="S0436" trans="overlap">no they just kind of</u>
<u n="236" who="S0435">oh</u>
<u n="237" who="S0436">so they</u>
<u n="238" who="S0435">had <trunc>Gran</trunc>Grantaire marries <unclear/> Enjolras and then they just condense the rest?</u>
<u n="239" who="S0436">yep</u>
<u n="240" who="S0435">so there were four of them</u>
<u n="241" who="S0436" trans="overlap">hang on come here your hair is doing awful things</u>
<u n="242" who="S0435">no it's fine</u>
<u n="243" who="S0436">well no you're</u>

<u n="247" who="S0436">okay</u>
<u n="248" who="S0435">so there were four of them?</u>
<u n="249" who="S0436">er pretty much</u>
<u n="250" who="S0435">trying to lead a revolution</u>
<u n="251" who="S0436">well it was implied that there were lots of people in the background</u>
<u n="252" who="S0435">okay</u>
<u n="253" who="S0436">I mean you know there's what there's</u>
<u n="254" who="S0435">just the rest of them were mute</u>
<u n="255" who="S0436">there's what was nine of them in the novel or something</u>
<u n="256" who="S0435">but it's all <unclear/></u>
<u n="257" who="S0436" trans="overlap">and there's nine of them trying to lead a revolution</u>
<u n="258" who="S0435" trans="overlap">that's a double not but I think four people being the only people who talk during a revolution is a bit</u>
<u n="259" who="S0436">perhaps but come on it's a radio play how many</u>
<u n="260" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="261" who="S0436">you know distinct voices can you really get? but you know? there you are I suppose also you know they added in the oddest bits though from what I remember</u>
<u n="262" who="S0435">I presume they didn't add in pot plants and things</u>
<u n="263" who="S0436">no they they did dedicate several lines to erm sort of miscellaneous composite student rambling about tomatoes and I presume</u>
<u n="264" who="S0435">and I presume they didn't wasn't</u>
<u n="265" who="S0436" trans="overlap">which wasn't in the original</u>
<u n="266" who="S0435" trans="overlap">I presume they didn't do the erm mystic sultana or whatever</u>
<u n="267" who="S0436">but that was just the <trunc>narra</trunc> come on the that was perfectly unexceptionable in the original it was just you know</u>
<u n="268" who="S0435">the translation?</u>
<u n="269" who="S0436">yeah translators with cloth ears I don't know it was just mystic sultana</u>
<u n="270" who="S0435">wonder which erm which translation they mainly based the radio thing on?</u>
<u n="271" who="S0436">oh doesn't make much odds does it?</u>
<u n="272" who="S0435">probably not but i presume they lifted quite a lot of the erm</u>
<u n="273" who="S0436">yeah</u>
<u n="274" who="S0435">text straight out quite a lot of the erm speech straight out of the book</u>
<u n="275" who="S0436">not that I particularly remember but <pause dur="short"/> I don't know I suppose of course if you erm based it on the Penguin Classics translation you might fall into problems</u>
<u n="276" who="S0435">what did they do?</u>
<u n="277" who="S0436">er basically the Penguin Classic translator hates the book</u>
<u n="278" who="S0435">oh</u>
<u n="279" who="S0436">it's rather funny he writes a long sort of translators note at the beginning explaining how he felt it was his moral duty <vocal desc="laugh"/> to make up for all of the terrible things in this book which does make you wonder why he chose to translate it in the first place but there you are</u>
<u n="280" who="S0435">presumably they told him you're going to translate this cos you're our you are our French translator</u>
<u n="281" who="S0436">mm perhaps but it would seem a little what do I know about translation</u>
<u n="282" who="S0435">I presume they don't get very much choice in it really cos if I presume they don't have sort of hundreds of each language translators</u>
<u n="283" who="S0436">I'm sure there are gazillions people who can translate French</u>
<u n="284" who="S0435">but I mean you have to be not only competent at reading French and reading in English you have to be competent at reading and working out what on earth he means and then writing it out in something which is close enough to the original that it can count as a translation but not so awful as sort of let's get out my dictionary and translate every word</u>
<u n="285" who="S0436">yes well I think some people would argue how much er the er a Penguin Classics translator actually succeeds on that front but again you know I think trying to translate all those puns in French would drive anyone mad</u>
<u n="286" who="S0435" trans="overlap">and like the usual</u>
<u n="287" who="S0436" trans="overlap">I'm pretty sure most of them sailed right over my head because you know look at me do I speak fluent French? ha ha no do I speak fluent nineteenth century posh French by someone who's disturbingly addicted to bad puns er what do you think? but</u>
<u n="288" who="S0435">I don't know I I like in the version I've read the the the fact you've occasionally got footnotes on seemingly sort of entirely unneeded footnote sections just sort of saying this means this this this okay good to know but I don't know what you're talking about</u>
<u n="289" who="S0436">yes yeah dear</u>
<u n="290" who="S0435">mm</u>
<u n="291" who="S0436">did you bother finish reading the book?</u>
<u n="292" who="S0435">I don't know I took it off my Kindle when I was doing a whole sort of <pause dur="short"/> spring</u>
<u n="293" who="S0436" trans="overlap">spring cleaning</u>
<u n="294" who="S0435">yes because I ended up changing the battery but first I took everything off to see whether that helped cos whether it was a sort of er what do you call it? er a sort of what I sort of</u>
<u n="295" who="S0436">you're going to have to give me some more information to go on</u>
<u n="296" who="S0435">erm it's a sort of er you you they when it goes through and sort of er so you can use a search function and search through books I've forgotten what the word is called and it it sort of it has to go analyse the books first and if it hasn't done it yet it slows down the battery life horrifically it's a</u>
<u n="297" who="S0436">oh you mean it lets you search inside the text of the books you have stored on it?</u>
<u n="298" who="S0435" trans="overlap">yes <trunc>in</trunc></u>
<u n="299" who="S0436">it I don't know that mine even</u>
<u n="300" who="S0435" trans="overlap">indexing yes it does</u>
<u n="301" who="S0436">lets you do that</u>
<u n="302" who="S0435">erm it's an index</u>
<u n="303" who="S0436" trans="overlap">cos mine isn't a Kindle</u>
<u n="304" who="S0435">erm the it it indexes books and if it's halfway through it or sort of got stuck indexing a book or something it will it slows down the battery life to or sort of <trunc>i</trunc>it makes it sort of</u>
<u n="305" who="S0436" trans="overlap">eats up the battery life</u>
<u n="306" who="S0435" trans="overlap">eats battery life ridiculously quickly</u>
<u n="307" who="S0436">mm fair enough</u>
<u n="308" who="S0435">and so I just took everything off and then that was one of the things which I didn't end up putting back on because I wasn't reading at that point</u>
<u n="309" who="S0436" trans="overlap">mm fair enough I need to do that with my silly phone though</u>
<u n="310" who="S0435">what's the matter with it? is it just slowing down?</u>
<u n="311" who="S0436">although you know it did it before but apparently it's just what Android phones do sometimes I looked it up on the internet and pretty much everyone says this happens and just after a while it decides that there's erm there's no space left for sort of downloading apps and things even though you do have storage space left it just refuses to acknowledge that</u>
<u n="312" who="S0435">ah</u>
<u n="313" who="S0436">and there's apparently no way to fix it other than putting it back to the factory settings</u>
<u n="314" who="S0435">oh</u>
<u n="315" who="S0436">so mine's got to that point again this is the second time it's happened and furthermore I've finally got my new er SIM card</u>
<u n="316" who="S0435">ah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0436">in the post and low and behold it's not recognising that either so sort of you know last bright glimmer of optimism is that if I put it back to factory settings it might finally twig what's going on with that as will which would be nice cos I rang up the man this morning and he said oh yes yes yes that's perfectly fine you just need to leave the SIM card in your phone for an hour before you restart it so I walked it into town this afternoon and funnily enough it did nothing thank you man on the phone really helpful</u>
<u n="318" who="S0435">I don't know I just keep everything on an SD card on my phone</u>
<u n="319" who="S0436">I keep everything on an SD card but it doesn't recognise the space on the SD card</u>
<u n="320" who="S0435">oh</u>
<u n="321" who="S0436">I think it's just one of those</u>
<u n="322" who="S0435">can yours use an SD card?</u>
<u n="323" who="S0436">yes that's why it has an SD card in it</u>
<u n="324" who="S0435">yeah but but the tablet you've got upstairs is an Android one and it updated and it didn't it it refused to use it unless you sort of did sort of jail breaking it</u>
<u n="325" who="S0436">really?</u>
<u n="326" who="S0435">yes the newest versions of Android don't let you use them even if you've got slots in your device</u>
<u n="327" who="S0436">oh heavens well perhaps I don't want to put it back to factory settings then or it'll have a fit at me</u>
<u n="328" who="S0435">maybe it's</u>
<u n="329" who="S0436">rr technology</u>
<u n="330" who="S0435" trans="overlap">maybe it's maybe it's <trunc>o</trunc> maybe it's only for the tablets rather than the phones but I'd check it first just cos seems like a bit of a rubbish thing to</u>

<u n="332" who="S0435">yeah</u>
<u n="333" who="S0436">I mean I suppose at least in the current situation I can I can access the things that are already stored on the SD card I just can't put any new stuff on there whereas theoretically if it just revoked my SD card I</u>

<u n="338" who="S0435">no</u>
<u n="339" who="S0436">well you would be right I don't pay attention but no I'm at least one update behind cos I keep on ignoring it cos cos life is difficult and I have too many things to do and making I don't know consoling noises at my phone while it has identity crisis is really not top of my priority list right now</u>

<u n="346" who="S0435" trans="overlap">everyone's complained everyone complains about the screens but I'm I'm not sure whether that one's and actually because they have I think it is partly because they have the exposed screen at the corner cos the glass goes all the way and it doesn't have a bevelled edge</u>

<u n="411" who="S0436" trans="overlap">year was an invigilator I could ask him I suppose</u>
<u n="412" who="S0435">and and one of one of the other ones was okay so now we've got your word</u>
<u n="413" who="S0436">uh</u>
<u n="414" who="S0435">now think of something which sounds like that word okay? then put it in a scenario with a word that rhymes with a number in in a sequence</u>
<u n="415" who="S0436" trans="overlap">oh yes you said that</u>
<u n="416" who="S0435">I'm learning three times as much stuff here how is that helpful?</u>
<u n="417" who="S0436">mm well you know sort of I have to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that for certain things it works because you know those people who can memorise entire card decks</u>
<u n="418" who="S0435">but they do it in actual</u>
<u n="419" who="S0436" trans="overlap">do you use these kinds of things</u>
<u n="420" who="S0435">but they <trunc>j</trunc>use much they then the the card decks the thing about the difference between those is that instead of <trunc>ac</trunc> having actual meaning it what the each of the things have they are just sequences aren't they?</u>
<u n="421" who="S0436">I've never you you mean the card deck is a meaningless sequence</u>
<u n="422" who="S0435" trans="overlap">yes the card is just is just a meaningless sequence and maybe people can see patterns in it but as it is it's just a <trunc>meaning</trunc> <trunc>le</trunc> <trunc>se</trunc></u>
<u n="423" who="S0436">whereas the problem the problem with trying to teach you that you should be doing your revision by learning things as meaningless sequences is most of it isn't a meaningless sequence yes</u>
<u n="424" who="S0435" trans="overlap">a meaningless sequence</u>
<u n="425" who="S0436">yes it's just like erm</u>
<u n="426" who="S0435" trans="overlap">and if if if you reduce things to meaningless sequences you find it harder to then apply it when you need it cos there are very few exam questions which just say name the thing this arrow is pointing at</u>
<u n="427" who="S0436">yeah it's just like mummy always used to complain about with the er <vocal desc="misc"/> CGP maths text books</u>
<u n="428" who="S0435">oh oh</u>
<u n="429" who="S0436">cos they did an awful lot of that thing where they say would say you know memorise five formulae or</u>

<u n="432" who="S0435">yes</u>

<u n="435" who="S0436">if you actually understood how they worked but</u>
<u n="436" who="S0435">yes but honestly I somebody was looking through a maths text book whoever writes these text books I don't understand what happens in their brains they had a picture of a triangle and for no apparent reason there was a photo of a goat in the middle of it</u>
<u n="437" who="S0436">that's just CGP trying to be quirky</u>
<u n="438" who="S0435">yeah but it wasn't even CGP</u>

<u n="443" who="S0436">mm yes</u>
<u n="444" who="S0435">honestly the CGP ones the little comments they put on are so patronising they're just okay so now you've read this page over once so now what I want you to do is close the book go on a nice brisk five minute wake come back read it again and repeat so then you will now automatically remember this for the rest of your life and this will automatically be the best way of you learning this information</u>
<u n="445" who="S0436">you're just objecting to being told to go on a five minute walk don't you?</u>

<u n="447" who="S0436">lazy little so and so</u>
<u n="448" who="S0435">no not exactly but it's just this idea that they say how much time are you meant to spend if you're meant to be doing this for every single page they ask you to</u>
<u n="449" who="S0436">no I I accept that it's rather patronising but honestly for for all my final exams I did memorise almost all of it by writing down the things I needed to have memorised on bit of paper and then just walking round and round and round in circles in the garden just you know declaiming them to the trees</u>
<u n="450" who="S0435">I find doing actual</u>

<u n="452" who="S0435">I find doing <trunc>ac</trunc> sort of doing actual sort of questions and things on them cos that means when you get one wrong or you can't answer it you look back find out the answer and that answer always is the one that you can remember</u>
<u n="453" who="S0436">cos you just remember the crippling embarrassment that can fail to remember something so obvious the first time</u>
<u n="454" who="S0435">yeah</u>
<u n="455" who="S0436">at least that's how it works for me but yeah no obviously some things you do need to just memorise by rote and to be honest I do kind of favour the you know recite ad infinitum thing you remember when I did er GCSE was it GCSE or was it A level? A level the one where we er had to do all memorise all those English Lit set texty things so we could cos it was closed book you had to be able to do quotes well I don't know they wanted us to just take relevant quotes out of these poems and memorise the quotes but they were poems you can just memorise the poems so I</u>

<u n="459" who="S0436">it's not really testing your literary analysis in a way yeah</u>
<u n="460" who="S0435" trans="overlap"> ly testing your English cos if they wanted to just stop you from having the answers written on the book you're taking in just give just give people the passage you want them to use or the poem they want you to use as a fresh piece of paper it's not like you're</u>

<u n="462" who="S0435">yes but that that that's a fair enough thing but doing that because actually you're not really English is I don't know the one thing in its favour is that actually it's not something where mindless memorisation is a sort of</u>
<u n="463" who="S0436">it doesn't seem like a terribly relevant skill in many ways yeah</u>
<u n="464" who="S0435">cos I mean for science you can you can't really get away from the fact that it's pretty much mindless memorisation</u>
<u n="465" who="S0436">on a certain level the whole the whole stick they're selling with the English literature is you know engaging your creativity creativity and stuff so yeah you do kind of wonder</u>
<u n="466" who="S0435">well I I I personally don't think maths is mindless sort of memorisation but I think a lot of people do</u>

<u n="528" who="S0435">or maybe it's a pre-horsey stage</u>
<u n="529" who="S0436">I don't know my experience was they were done by rather different sort of cliques as it were</u>

<u n="618" who="S0436">mm</u>
<u n="619" who="S0435">and so then when you transfer it to other things it doesn't keep that inherent ordering</u>

<u n="675" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="676" who="S0436">doesn't he? at least from the very few things I've seen him in</u>
<u n="677" who="S0435">but I mean as far as I I've been led to believe people who really like Star Trek are entirely on board with the fact they they don't differentiate and say this isn't a Star Wars film</u>
<u n="678" who="S0436">hang on</u>
<u n="679" who="S0435" trans="overlap">they count it as being the the Galaxy Quest</u>

<u n="690" who="S0436">erm</u>
<u n="691" who="S0435">instead of just being one person sitting there on their computer and doing it sort of you have big websites publishing these</u>

<u n="968" who="S0436">oh I just think I just think the music really makes all of those <unclear/></u>
<u n="969" who="S0435">but generally I'm not very good at computer animation for films and things generally I like computer animation but I really don't like the way they do computer animated films</u>

<u n="971" who="S0435">the style they've chosen to do it in?</u>

<u n="977" who="S0435" trans="overlap">I mean the and the really disconcerting thing is that that that that you have these really sort of tiny necks tiny nose tiny mouth massive eyed people but with with</u>
<u n="978" who="S0436">so it's like all those manga people you used to draw</u>
<u n="979" who="S0435">yeah with with perfect sort of unruffleable hair and sort of blocky unruffleable hair and then then then then you have these background which are pretty passable as being filmed</u>

<u n="985" who="S0435">the contrast between the background and erm the people I think I don't know I think there's <trunc>cer</trunc>certain levels but the thing about the people I have a problem with the background is the backgrounds are perfectly sort of rendered but look almost photographic then you have the people they are really out of proportion stylised but then there's fine details and there's sort of the the textured skin the textured lips</u>
<u n="986" who="S0436" trans="overlap">yes that's the mm that's the problem I have</u>
<u n="987" who="S0435" trans="overlap">and the and the really detailed irises and things and it just looks wrong</u>

<u n="989" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="990" who="S0436">so it moves right and so it looks like a I don't know like a nonperson made out of person material and it's a little bit disconcerting isn't it?</u>
<u n="991" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="992" who="S0436">yeah but there you are that's why I think you ought to come with me to see the erm was it is the er</u>
<u n="993" who="S0435">the thingy one the</u>
<u n="994" who="S0436">the thing they're advertising by the people who did Secret of Kells</u>
<u n="995" who="S0435">the one that looks very very twee</u>

<u n="1001" who="S0435">oh</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0436">and I didn't see so many adverts for that so possibly that's what the adverts looked like for this but anyway I mean I really wasn't watching the Secret of Kells for the story was I?</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0435">no</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0436">I watched it because it's just it does my heart good to see people sort of doing doing animation that sort of takes advantage of the fact that it's animation and sort of explores that</u>

<u n="1006" who="S0436">you know</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0435">but I think that's why I so really like the Studio Ghibli things because I think they are they they do take into account the erm they are a bit twee in the general sense but I think it's a it's probably a sort of I think it's a probably more of a culture difference thing why it feels less sort of sickeningly twee and more sort of happily twee</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0436">I think you're making distinctions I never even knew existed but fair enough I you should probably make me watch some more of it you know give your sister some cultural education</u>

<u n="1022" who="S0436">that doesn't explain why they were black ooze blobs wearing straw hats come on</u>
<u n="1023" who="S0435">I think they were lack ooze blobs because they were meant to be being a shown as being evil</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0436">and they wore straw hats because?</u>
<u n="1025" who="S0435">to blend in with the crowds</u>
<u n="1026" who="S0436">naturally</u>
<u n="1027" who="S0435">because or they were meant to be being shown to be evil but they were not meant to be looking like they were they were meant to be being they were being used as passably human servant things</u>

<u n="1033" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1034" who="S0435">yeah but they chose the right one to turn into a a sort of film that was going to make even less sense than the book because if they'd done it to pretty much any of her other ones</u>

<u n="1036" who="S0436">although you do have to wonder how much weirder it would be possible to make <unclear/></u>

<u n="1039" who="S0435">I never read that one</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0436">didn't you? I could swear we got it up no I don't see why I would have read it if you didn't because I don't spontaneously read these things so I assume I pilfered it off you</u>
<u n="1041" who="S0435">oh I don't I don't remember reading it</u>
<u n="1042" who="S0436">it was the erm Tam Lin one</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0435">oh I think I might have done actually I can't remember what it's about</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0436">erm oh don't ask me it made no sense there was something odd to do with stone gateposts at one point</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0435">oh yes</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0436">and erm she did her slightly disconcerting narrative fetish for age gappy relationships again</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0435">I think so</u>
<u n="1048" who="S0436">and I honestly can't remember what else happened cos yeah I was rather lost</u>
<u n="1049" who="S0435">don't know I think her her what's his name <unclear/> ones were good I liked them</u>
<u n="1050" who="S0436">yeah they were good fun</u>
<u n="1051" who="S0435">but I think after that they just got weirder and weirder</u>
<u n="1052" who="S0436">and Howl's Moving Castle is genuinely funny but it's not really my cup of tea I suppose I I do remember when I I was remember when I was reading you Howl's moving Castle and the Lord of the Rings at the same time</u>
<u n="1053" who="S0435">oh vaguely</u>
<u n="1054" who="S0436">and it was astounding how much easier the Lord of the Rings was to read out loud</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0435">that's what didn't mummy find that when she was trying to read you Crest of <unclear/></u>
<u n="1056" who="S0436">oh that was she refused cos she hated reading it out loud yes</u>
<u n="1057" who="S0435" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0436">I think it's it's not bad to read one it you don't notice it when you read it to yourself I don't think at least you have to sort of be paying half an ear to it as it were</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0435">no but I I don't know it's very easy to you know the Rivers of London books I have a similar problem I've had a similar problem reading them and it's nothing to do with a problem with the writing as such because he's a screenwriter you can if if if you look for it you can really tell cos quite a lot of other writers do have a maybe not to a very great extent but it's not just a he said they said she said sort of thing they sort of add stuff in to to put the text into put the speech into context</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0436">yes</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0435">whereas as a screenwriter you notice that what he does is he has text full stop thing happening and he does it very well it works very well but once you notice that consciously while reading a passage it's really difficult to get past it</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0436">fair enough yeah I suppose I don't know I enjoyed Rivers of London well enough but I don't think I'd ever bother to read the rest</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0435">I think it is just cos I do like his things I think I think it's I think it's because I do like a Dr Who level of weirdness in my books</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0436" trans="overlap">no it wasn't the weirdness putting me off it was genuinely just too gory for me</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0435">well I think it gets less or it doesn't it's not as bad in the later books</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0436">people got their faces ripped off okay? it was traumatising</u>

<u n="1071" who="S0436">yeah yeah fair enough I I think they're one of those things where I'm sort of going to be happy that they exist on other people's behalf but I'm not really going to bother getting into it myself</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0435">mm yeah fair enough I</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0436">seeing as we appear to be talking about books again</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0435">mm</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0436">we're not very good at having conversations about other things are we? anyway I was going to ask you have you started er reading the <unclear>Gutnicks</unclear>?</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0435">no not yet</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0436">fair enough</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0435">it's kind of depressing sometimes I forget that there are some people that don't like Douglas Adams you have to be a real really different person not to <trunc>ac</trunc> it's like</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0436">I can see how you could not like like certain aspects of it but it's hard to see how you could not find the jokes funny and and the thing is you always notice they're in people who read book I entirely could never manage they have different tastes</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0435">I know but you know those sort of pseudo erm life like sort of people go on an adventure with their dog kind of books</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0436">no I really don't</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0435">no no you know Michael Morpurgo is a sort of is an Uncanny <trunc>va</trunc>Valley sort of real-life thing</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0436">you just don't like Michael Morpurgo</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0435">I don't but you know that kind of style of book and those sort of those soppy feel-good books and the sort of the sort of erm that the oh I'm spending my time talking about my life nothing very much happens and this sort of books</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0436" trans="overlap">you mean I don't know I suppose I tend to think of those as two separate things really</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0435">I think they are but I think they're very linked</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0436">Michael Morpurgo is just a children's writer writes children's books</u>
<u n="1088" who="S0435" trans="overlap">I just can't stand it</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0436">whereas when you say soppy books about my life I think of those you know sort of awful ten-a-penny library books pastel covers and pictures of blonde ladies on the front</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0435">no I don't mean those ones I mean the ones with the erm the sort of the the those light blue sort of photographs with the swirly white writing on kind of one's</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0436"><vocal desc="laugh"/> just thinking</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0435">but you know the ones I mean</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0436">don't judge a book by its cover ah</u>
<u n="1094" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1095" who="S0435">but I mean I think it's same sort of people who go on from things like Michael Morpurgo to those sorts of books and the sort of the sort of people who really no</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0436" trans="overlap">is this The Fault in Our Stars or something you're thinking</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0435">no not particularly</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0436" trans="overlap">but you liked that didn't you?</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0435">not particularly but that kind of style of thing and the erm and the er sort of the whole sort of people who really like first person stuff</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0436"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1101" who="S0435">I mean there's nothing in practice wrong with first person there are</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0436">some of my best friends are in first person</u>
<u n="1103" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1104" who="S0435">I mean there are lots of really good books in first person but first person does quite often bring the worst out in books for me</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0436">yeah well I guess fair enough <pause dur="short"/> I've forgotten what you were reading oh people who don't like Douglas Adams</u>
<u n="1106" who="S0435">yes I just there are people who like very peopley books rather than ploty books yes</u>
<u n="1107" who="S0436">well Douglas Adams does not have any plot either</u>
<u n="1108" who="S0435">no but he's working on the assumption that the lack of plot is erm I think the lack of plot is a is due to a sort of the fact that he's packed it too full of other stuff</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0436">I think he just</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0435" trans="overlap">to put in a plot</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0436">didn't really have the attention span to write plots sadly</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0435">no</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0436">the jokes are just so funny I don't know how you cannot find them funny</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0435">I have no I sort of have an understanding why</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0436">lord you're turning into a penguin stop it</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0435" trans="overlap">but I I can sort of understand why some people may not like Hitchhiker's Guide because of the sort of weird non sequitur</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0436">yeah it is very whacky and very disjointed</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0435">it is but how you cannot like Dirk Gently or Hitchhiker's Guide</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0436">well by most people's standards Dirk Gently is also very whacky and disjointed it only doesn't look whacky and disjointed when you come to it after reading the Hitchhiker's Guide which doesn't even pretend to have a plot</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0435">well in the later ones it sort of tries to</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0436">and frankly goes massively downhill with it but there you are</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0435">I still can't get over the fact that the erm Eoin Colfer sequel is just so <unclear/> cos it was it was just a oh it was all a dream</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0436">really? oh</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0435">it really was and it was that was the worst thing you could ever apply and it was all a dream to</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0436">er I don't know I'd say that it's as valid a plot move as most things that happen</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0435">yes but it was just a no no no no</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0436" trans="overlap">in the series and</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0435">but but it was nowhere near as funny because he obviously wasn't Douglas Adams</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0436">yes but that was sort of inevitable</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0435" trans="overlap">and so so he went down the plot route and took what little plot there was and tried to make it into a big plot and then just said oh well it was all a dream they all actually died</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0436">really?</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0436">okay now I'm glad I didn't read it I mean I never really liked Eoin Colfer anyway</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0435"><unclear/> I almost could manage but it was just slightly off</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0436">well I tried to read Artemis Fowl and it was just it smacked far too much of the target audience being hyperactive teenage boys for me to sort of really have the patience for what it was sort of it was very he jumped up and down shouting in your face</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0435" trans="overlap">I think I managed my way though I managed about three quarters of the way through first book I think or something</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0436">I think I turned all the pages in the book but mainly because I was transliterating the silly cipher they had at the bottom of the pages which it turned out it repeated so that was pointless <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1138" who="S0435">I think I think if you do that you should at least write something interesting that you wouldn't already find in the book</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0436">oh you you you didn't it was it was genuinely something new I think but anyway so I had fun with that but anyway I don't know who who would there's no one who could really write Douglas Adams except Douglas Adams I mean the closest you could get is Terry Pratchett</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0435" trans="overlap">you could get is Terry Pratchett if they'd given it to Terry Pratchett you would have maybe you wouldn't have got a Douglas Adams look-alike out of it but you would have got a good book out of it</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0436">yes <pause dur="short"/> I'm still sad about Terry Pratchett</u>
<u n="1142" who="S0435">yes the new book's coming out though</u>
<u n="1143" who="S0436">yeah I don't even know whether I want to read it or whether it would feel a bit you know weird and morbid</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0435">I am because it's another Tiffany Aching one and I sort of</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0436">I'm not so keen on them you see</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0435">no I I do like them but I think the thing is that they're they're one of the few actual proper coherent sort of series within the</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0436">oh yes I just</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0435">and I feel that it would be a bit of a shame to</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0436">to sort of let that go you mean</u>
<u n="1150" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="1151" who="S0436">fair enough and I'll probably end up reading it at some point anyway I don't know I think I'll probably just you know steal Going Postal from you again and curl up in a little nest of Going Postal <pause dur="short"/> so funny</u>
<u n="1152" who="S0435">I I still can't I still think Night Watch is just so utterly brilliant</u>
<u n="1153" who="S0436">the Night Watch is utterly brilliant</u>
<u n="1154" who="S0435">and I think that's not just cos it's funny though</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0436">yes Night Watch is one of the very thinky ones Going Postal has some very good thinky stuff in it as well it's just also I think in many ways sort of overtly funny</u>
<u n="1156" who="S0435">oh yes I think Night <trunc>Wa</trunc> <trunc>Wat</trunc> Night Watch is one of the least overtly funny ones</u>
<u n="1157" who="S0436">yeah I mean it has some fairly good gags in but</u>
<u n="1158" who="S0435">the boiled eggs</u>
<u n="1159" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1160" who="S0436">poor <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and his hardboiled egg but er yes <pause dur="short"/> I just really like Going Postal</u>
<u n="1161" who="S0435">okay</u>
<u n="1162" who="S0436">yes <pause dur="long"/> but yeah you have to read it now you see you've only for the <unclear/> thing</u>
<u n="1163" who="S0435">mm</u>
<u n="1164" who="S0436">mm ah anyway we should probably wrap up now considering that we've been wittering on at each other for nearly two hours</u>
<u n="1165" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="1166" who="S0436">you were telling me you couldn't think of anything to say for that long</u>
<u n="1167" who="S0435">no</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0436">and you didn't even have to resort to summarising entire big finishes and things which is</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0435">you still have time ten minutes</u>
<u n="1170" who="S0436">no no no no</u>
<u n="1171" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1172" who="S0435">are you sure you don't want the communist Daleks on drugs?</u>
<u n="1173" who="S0436">I think I have never been surer of anything in my life</u>
<u n="1174" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1175" who="S0435">actually no you wouldn't get that one anyway cos I still don't understand it</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="1176" who="S0436">and I think that proves my point</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0435">ahem just because there are far too many layers of non-reality in it <pause dur="short"/> and then they start singing</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0436">do they start singing Gilbert and Sullivan is the question</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0435">no but they start</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0436">good</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0435">singing patriotic songs I think</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0436">real patriotic songs or?</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0435">yes like?</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0436">I can't remember what it is it it was cos all I can imagine now is sort of a fleet of Daleks all bursting into I don't know Jerusalem or something</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0435">no it's a I think it's a communist thing or thing you songy thing</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0436">yeah well that would make more sense I don't know any communist songs the closest I know to a communist song is the song about the history of communism set to the Tetris theme tune</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0435">oh</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0436">have you never heard that?</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0435">I've heard of it</u>
<u n="1190" who="S0436">it's it's quite something put it that way</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0435">yeah</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0436">no I came across that at er one of those</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0435">ASNaCs</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0436">er not actually ASNaCs but one of those sort of student gatherings of those kinds of people yes this was also one of er Youtube watching at midnight events that led to me finding that erm that those clips from a Playstation game with Tom Baker's narrating a story about magical dolphins stop and saving the universe</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0435">I sort of want to play that computer game</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0436">you've have to wonder what was going through their head</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0435">if it wasn't narrated by Tom Baker it would have been great</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0436">if by great you mean terrible</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0436">how did that get pitched?</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0435">I don't know I think they said well we know you like Douglas Adams so let's have dolphins cos cos Douglas Adams had dolphins</u>
<u n="1202" who="S0436">see the link?</u>
<u n="1203" who="S0435">okay and okay get this saving the universe see universe galaxy Douglas Adams and and then okay who can we think of that had a erm mm sci-fi Dr Who</u>
<u n="1204" who="S0436">I think all of that implies a level of logical thought that</u>
<u n="1205" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1206" who="S0435">wasn't it Splash the Dolphin or something</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0436">something equally awful yes</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0435">and didn't he get dolphins in spaceships and things?</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0436">I wouldn't be at all surprise but all the weird Youtube videos have been introduced to they do sort of blend into one</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0435">has there been more than one time time where you have dolphins saving the universe</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0436">er no but then there was also the video about erm the mass murdering llama that wears a hat</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0435" trans="overlap">oh very everyone's heard of that though</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0436" trans="overlap">well I hadn't</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0435">the erm the Stephen Carl one</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0436">oh yes it was called Carl</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0435">I think the other one was called Steve</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0436">fair enough I I wasn't paying attention I was too busy being traumatised er there was also the <unclear>Hayleg Thulu</unclear> song</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0435">no not heard that one</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0436">you probably don't want to I mean you've actually read Love Prophet so you might like it</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0435">and then there's the Nargle Song did you never see that <trunc>ne</trunc></u>
<u n="1221" who="S0436">no I don't want to do I?</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0435">probably not it's not that bad it's an animated song about nargles</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0436">naturally cos what else would it be? well this is the internet</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0435">it's less disturbing than the llamas in hats</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0436">good although that's not really saying very much</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0435">it is significantly less so</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0436">good although that's still not saying an awful lot</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0435">and it's less traumatising then the Charlie the Unicorn</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0436">did you ever have to watch that?</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0435">no nobody ever showed that one to me</u>
<u n="1231" who="S0436">you just need to be surgically removed from the internet</u>
<u n="1232" who="S0435">oh no no no no if <trunc>s</trunc> people my age I can say that</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0436">youth these days</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0435">a large proportion of them will have heard of the Nargle Song erm Charlie the Unicorn and what was the other one I was saying that you haven't heard of? was there another one? no and probably Llamas in Hats as well</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0436">fair enough then again I learnt fairly recently that what people of my age are supposed to remember on the internet is something about badger badger badger badger mushroom snake</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0435" trans="overlap">well everyone knows that yes</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0436">no I'd I'd never come across that</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0435">okay</u>
<u n="1239" who="S0436">I didn't spend very much time on the internet when I was little I spent a lot of time doing equally pointless things but you know other pointless things reading things of questionable literary value but you know maybe I can't claim to have grown out of that</u>
<u n="1240" who="S0435">you've read Blank and Fire</u>
<u n="1241" who="S0436">come on that was at least impressive</u>
<u n="1242" who="S0435">yes</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0436">you can't really claim it was bad just because that implies you have some coherent standards by which to judge its literary merit</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0435">I think I think that one has won discussions when people have been discussing who has read the weirdest book</u>
<u n="1245" who="S0436">no <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> still has be beat on that one</u>
<u n="1246" who="S0435">what one has?</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0436">she swears blind she can't remember much about it anymore but she swears blind she once read a book called the Voodoo Handbag</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0435">okay but it is weirder than a dragon that's dead and alive and a bridge all at the same time and trapped in a railway tunnel and somebody gets their arm burnt off by a dragon bone?</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0436">er I don't know I think we really do need to wrap this up now</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0435">yeah okay</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0436">bye bye Mr recording device</u>
