<u n="1217" who="S0616" trans="overlap">well exactly that's all it is sometimes yeah</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0590">yes see I think chemistry is taught completely wrongly cos I think the periodic table if you remember that do you? maybe not <trunc>w</trunc> I mean the periodic table of all the elements</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0616">yeah</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0590">I actually do think that if if GCSEs well any student of chemistry it's even more important the higher up you go if you actually understand all that</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0616">mm</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0590">you so much of it just</u>

<u n="1241" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="1242" who="S0616" trans="overlap"><unclear/> but the only but chemistry and biology the reasons I didn't like it cos I didn't like the teachers</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0616">didn't and</u>
