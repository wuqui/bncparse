<u n="7" who="S0421">we've got Talktalk internet now as well</u>
<u n="8" who="S0423">have you?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0421">yeah they came and put it in for us like the day after we moved in</u>
<u n="10" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well then how come you've gone with Talktalk then?</u>
<u n="11" who="S0421">it's cheap the cheapest</u>
<u n="12" who="S0423">so who did you have before?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0421">BT</u>
<u n="14" who="S0423">got you a starter</u>
<u n="15" who="S0421">oh <pause dur="short"/> it was an absolute rip off BT</u>
<u n="16" who="S0423">well I'm not on I've not gone with them now and I haven't done in years</u>
<u n="17" who="S0421" trans="overlap">cos we used to always had them because like we just never changed</u>

<u n="19" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0423">well that's what they rely on a lot of people don't</u>
<u n="21" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0423" trans="overlap">and so they don't look around and that's</u>
<u n="23" who="S0421" trans="overlap">and then but we were paying so much so we've got Talktalk and then he came this person and like sorted it</u>
<u n="24" who="S0423">well yeah I told your mammy years ago that it's really cheap</u>
<u n="25" who="S0421">yeah it's good</u>
<u n="26" who="S0423">and er</u>
<u n="27" who="S0421" trans="overlap">and it works <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="28" who="S0423">of course it does I can watch films on the internet with it</u>
<u n="29" who="S0421">but like he came this engineer</u>
<u n="30" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0421">and then cos we got our box in the post like the the router</u>
<u n="32" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0421">and erm he came to install the phone line and usually they install like the router for you as well and he didn't so I have to</u>
<u n="34" who="S0423">oh right</u>
<u n="35" who="S0421" trans="overlap">follow the instructions in the box and I was like oh it's alright I mean they are cheaper and everything and mammy was like why did they not install it? and I'm like I've managed to do it it only took me five minutes</u>
<u n="36" who="S0423">I just got mine in the post</u>
<u n="37" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0423">and I just did it cos there's not much to install really you just I mean</u>
<u n="39" who="S0421" trans="overlap">cos on on BT they're always like don't attempt to install it yourself</u>
<u n="40" who="S0423" trans="overlap">oh really?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0421">like we will come and do it for you</u>
<u n="42" who="S0423">oh well that's why cos they wanna charge you so much you see</u>
<u n="43" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah probably</u>
<u n="44" who="S0423">and make out that it's something special to do but you know you don't have to do much to put the router get the router sorted do you?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0421">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well we don't have erm a phone because we never used a phone so</u>
<u n="46" who="S0423">what so you're just getting the internet yeah?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0421">yeah like we have to have the phone line to get the internet through</u>
<u n="48" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0421">but we're not like plugging in our phone</u>
<u n="50" who="S0423">well it's only another fiver for a phone line isn't it? to have a phone plugged in you know if you want a a line you what are you just paying for the phone line?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0421">yeah so that we can have the internet through it but like we don't want the phone because whenever we've used the landline to make calls it's always worked out like more expensive</u>
<u n="52" who="S0423">well no you you you pay</u>
<u n="53" who="S0421" trans="overlap">than the mobile because of our mobile package is really good and we can make</u>
<u n="54" who="S0423" trans="overlap">you only pay five pound and you call anything for free</u>
<u n="55" who="S0421" trans="overlap">no I mean but it's just the paying for just like no I mean like company numbers and stuff cos that's all we ring and company numbers</u>
<u n="56" who="S0423" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="57" who="S0421">charge and it's the same as like</u>
<u n="58" who="S0423" trans="overlap">cos on the mobile they charge more don't they?</u>
<u n="59" who="S0421">no they don't they er it's it's worse on well cos when we used the landline it was just as much because of the mobile package that we've got it's some of them they charge more</u>
<u n="60" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well I thought your mammy was saying she's been paying thirty pound to ring the gas</u>
<u n="61" who="S0421">yeah because we were on the phone to them for like three three hours</u>
<u n="62" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah but if if you rang the landline</u>
<u n="63" who="S0421">no it's just as bad because we rang</u>
<u n="64" who="S0423" trans="overlap">what in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0421">no in <anon type="place"/> we rang all these companies like sorting out gas and internet and everything and our phone bill was like fifty odd pounds or something</u>
<u n="66" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well that's probably cos of the package you have with BT</u>
<u n="67" who="S0421">no because we were supposed to have free calls but all these numbers that we had to ring these companies were all exempt</u>
<u n="68" who="S0423" trans="overlap">oh why they were 0845 or something?</u>
<u n="69" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah they were all exempt so it just</u>

<u n="113" who="S0423">so I mean <anon type="place"/> it's the same as you had in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="114" who="S0421">yeah I just it's just changed so I'd say <pause dur="short"/> it seems different</u>
<u n="115" who="S0423">there you are <pause dur="short"/> mm but but are you going inside or are you staying here? I'm coming in now anyway cos there's nothing to do</u>

<u n="120" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0423">a couple of options? I mean you can browse and see if you can find anything else if you're not keen on them</u>
<u n="122" who="S0421">well we're lucky that there's still places to book <pause dur="short"/> cos we're leaving it quite late aren't we?</u>
<u n="123" who="S0423">yeah fortunately I don't think the kids will be yet like the kids will <trunc>ha</trunc> in in school holidays at that time then I mean it probably is coming up to it not far off it but <unclear/></u>
<u n="124" who="S0421" trans="overlap">like mid July I think isn't it?</u>
<u n="125" who="S0423">mm <pause dur="short"/> so you've got from the sixth to the tenth booked</u>
<u n="126" who="S0421">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0423">they said I can upgrade to a better caravan and make it a week where we're staying</u>
<u n="128" who="S0421">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0423">and I'll look <trunc>f</trunc> we could look for somewhere else for a few odd days but <pause dur="short"/> I got <vocal desc="cough"/> I thought well you might prefer a a lodge or something like that for for the weekly stay</u>
<u n="130" who="S0421">yeah <pause dur="short"/> don't know the caravan might be a bit cramped</u>
<u n="131" who="S0423">no it wasn't when we were in Scotland was it?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0421">yeah it wasn't bad actually that caravan <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0423">it depends what bungalow type thing you get</u>
<u n="134" who="S0421">yeah cos that could be cramped</u>
<u n="135" who="S0423" trans="overlap">you know some of them are not er great we were lucky in Scotland with that as well we had</u>
<u n="136" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0423" trans="overlap">a nice one</u>
<u n="138" who="S0421" trans="overlap">wow that was cool that was for like six people wasn't it?</u>
<u n="139" who="S0423">mm we won't be getting one like I don't think</u>
<u n="140" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/> well because when you said when we went to Italy and you were like oh I've got a little like house or whatever it was and it was like a room <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="141" who="S0423">I know that's it you see <trunc>y</trunc>you don't want a you may we may as well have a caravan <unclear>between</unclear> something like that</u>
<u n="142" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0423">some of the caravans are they're great they're massive</u>
<u n="144" who="S0421">mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0423">erm <pause dur="short"/> so you could look at that as an option there's the bigger caravans possibly they might be a good price</u>
<event desc="sound of phone"/> <pause dur="long"/>
<u n="146" who="S0423"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="147" who="S0421">have you fixed whatever was wrong with your internet with that re-stall?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0423">well I've I've done it a few times and the problem is it keeps</u>
<u n="149" who="S0421">doing it</u>
<u n="150" who="S0423" trans="overlap">even when I I changed the it's when I get an update so it kept updating and and then I kept changing it and eventually I was fed up so I thought right I'm gonna go into the control panel and say ask me before you install any upgrades</u>
<u n="151" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0423" trans="overlap">so I did that and then it just does the bloody update when I shut down again</u>
<u n="153" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="154" who="S0423">so then I've I've shut it off and it said it's not recommended that you don't have updates but for temporarily until I you know get this sorted I've I've shut off</u>
<u n="155" who="S0421" trans="overlap">what is it doing?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0423">so I don't get any updates any more</u>
<u n="157" who="S0421">mm</u>
<u n="158" who="S0423">and I've checked the updates it's putting down cos I was gonna look if it was something obvious and just delete that update</u>
<u n="159" who="S0421" trans="overlap">it's probably a bug in it or something I'm surprised no one's reported it</u>
<u n="160" who="S0423">well no there's various things it could be cos it it's the it it's coming up DEP er the data execution prevention</u>
<u n="161" who="S0421">mm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0423">there's a programme in there that stops and they said you you may have when you when you say what could be the problem they say it could be when you when you run <trunc>up</trunc>updates a company has <trunc>up</trunc> sent you an update and it's not compatible with this DEP</u>
<u n="163" who="S0421">mm</u>
<u n="164" who="S0423">and you should install uninstall it but all the updates are from Windows from Microsoft</u>
<u n="165" who="S0421" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0423">so I don't I don't get it</u>
<u n="167" who="S0421">mm</u>
<u n="168" who="S0423" trans="overlap">so I'll have to look a bit more in-depth so this is the only solution I could figure out er temporarily for now erm I mean I've got there's like free erm AVG security er thing and what have you on it so you would think if there <trunc>w</trunc> is a it it the computer's under attack or anything it should pick something up so there's no signs of anything like that going on but I think it's just a glitch in one of these programmes that are downloading maybe if I changed my browser from Internet Explorer to</u>
<u n="169" who="S0421" trans="overlap">is it internet</u>
<u n="170" who="S0423" trans="overlap">something else</u>
<u n="171" who="S0421">internet</u>
<u n="172" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="173" who="S0421" trans="overlap">Explorer is a rubbish browser</u>
<u n="174" who="S0423" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0421">get Google Chrome</u>
<u n="176" who="S0423">yeah I was just</u>
<u n="177" who="S0421" trans="overlap">that's better</u>
<u n="178" who="S0423" trans="overlap">just thinking that today that might be a more better long term solution so I thought Google Chrome or Firefox or</u>
<u n="179" who="S0421" trans="overlap">like if you can help it like no <trunc>o</trunc> no one uses Internet Explorer any more</u>
<u n="180" who="S0423">really?</u>
<u n="181" who="S0421">I mean people do but it's quite slow and there's like stuff wrong with it and</u>
<u n="182" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="183" who="S0421">I don't have Internet Explorer</u>
<u n="184" who="S0423">well I've not had problems with it before but I think that might be a a way of solving it</u>
<u n="185" who="S0421"><trunc>ye</trunc> have you heard that like you know like Windows ten or something that's coming out? <pause dur="short"/> I think it's gonna be like a free update if you've got an old Windows</u>
<u n="186" who="S0423">oh really?</u>
<u n="187" who="S0421">mm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0423">mm I've not heard of that <pause dur="short"/> this Vista is is not very much rated either is it? it's not supposed to be that great</u>
<u n="189" who="S0421">yeah but the new like</u>
<u n="190" who="S0423"><unclear>seems like quite like</unclear></u>
<u n="191" who="S0421" trans="overlap">the new like Windows eight they've got has got so many problems with it</u>
<u n="192" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="193" who="S0421" trans="overlap">and erm like most people have that one and they said they're like oh yeah Windows ten you can have it for free because it was</u>
<u n="194" who="S0423" trans="overlap">oh right I wonder if they'll give it me or if it's just if you've eight</u>
<u n="195" who="S0421">yeah I dunno I think you might get it</u>
<u n="196" who="S0423">mm</u>

<u n="200" who="S0423">oh right</u>
<u n="201" who="S0421" trans="overlap">it's like you know on like your smartphone where you have like apps?</u>
<u n="202" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="203" who="S0421">and it's like you click them but on Windows eight they didn't have a start menu but in Windows ten they've brought the start menu back so it's a bit easier to navigate</u>
<u n="204" who="S0423">oh right</u>
<u n="205" who="S0421">but yeah in Windows eight there was no start menu and people were like what am I doing?</u>
<u n="206" who="S0423">yeah you'd think before doing updates like that they'd consult people <pause dur="short"/> I don't like the <trunc>s</trunc> look of that what's come down there</u>
<u n="207" who="S0421">file task</u>
