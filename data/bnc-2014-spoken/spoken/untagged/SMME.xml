<u n="713" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="714" who="S0041">and basically we can sell the whole space for twelve grand <pause dur="short"/> so someone can hire it out for twelve grand basically to cover their the room and for two hundred and seventy people to eat <pause dur="short"/> so it works out pretty good</u>
<u n="715" who="S0084">mm mm</u>
<u n="716" who="S0041">she sold it half capacity and promised it them exclusively and I said to her no <pause dur="short"/> I said no we're not doing that <pause dur="short"/> and she said yeah we are I said no that's our peak day next month because the way the month lands we're not selling it</u>
<u n="717" who="S0084">mm mm</u>
<u n="718" who="S0041">they could have one room exclusively and then we can only lose kinda twenty percent</u>
<u n="719" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="720" who="S0041">but the bar spend on top of that last year was two grand so you're talking eight grand plus if they want bedrooms <pause dur="short"/> I said you can't take it </u>
<u n="721" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="722" who="S0041"> Not that weekend I said give them this day or this day and then they can have it <pause dur="short"/> </u>

<u n="726" who="S0041">and just said ooh you know that's a peak day <pause dur="short"/> she says yeah I'm trying to talk them out of it <pause dur="short"/> gives the contract gets them to sign it</u>
<u n="727" who="S0084">so was this the key account?</u>
<u n="728" who="S0041">yep <pause dur="short"/> she gets marks cos it's her key account but we've just lost</u>

<u n="730" who="S0041">a shit load of money</u>
<u n="731" who="S0084">yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> so it looks good but after you really look at it</u>
<u n="732" who="S0041">and not just the money <pause dur="short"/> but we'd lost two hundred covers for two hundred people and our achievement this year was four thousand <pause dur="short"/> so two hundred on four thousand</u>
<u n="733" who="S0046">it is a lot of people</u>
<u n="734" who="S0041">on the big pasty day</u>

<u n="740" who="S0041">she's such a bitch</u>
<u n="741" who="S0084">it's so hard isn't it? But when you see people like that who are taking who are getting so much credit and you just think but they're actually not doing anything <pause dur="short"/> it's probably more to do with the fact that the hotel is run really inefficiently <pause dur="short"/> because actually if you had someone there if you had you know The Hilton running it it seems unlikely that they would allow someone like that</u>
<u n="742" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="743" who="S0084">to get away with what they're getting away with</u>
<u n="744" who="S0041">and the best part is usually in the hotels the other people that do her job look after a cluster <pause dur="short"/> so they'll be a sales director and sales manager sales exec</u>
<u n="745" who="S0084">mm hm</u>
<u n="746" who="S0041">for a cluster of hotels they'll look after three or four hotels so their key accounts span across the region</u>
<u n="747" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="748" who="S0041">and they travel a lot and they work for people but because of our <trunc>sh</trunc> hotel being shit like I don't understand what the fuck's going on <pause dur="short"/> she just has to look after one hotel <pause dur="short"/> so there's just the director of sales and her and they have an inbase office in the hotel which never happens</u>
<u n="749" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="750" who="S0041">they usually don't have a base they have to kind of meet people all the time it's really hard work and networking</u>
<u n="751" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="752" who="S0041">handed on a plate she got her own desk own laptop</u>
<u n="753" who="S0084">oh my god</u>

<u n="1444" who="S0041">ooh and I found out today during my fire safety training she can't kick off to us about taking it off</u>
<u n="1445" who="S0084">it's illegal to have open anyway isn't it?</u>
<u n="1446" who="S0041">it's not a fire door It's not a fire door If it was a fire door it should be a heavy duty door and that's just wood</u>
<u n="1447" who="S0084">not window <pause dur="short"/> not with glass in it</u>
<u n="1448" who="S0041">yeah</u>

<u n="1451" who="S0046">it's a solid door <pause dur="short"/> solid</u>
<u n="1452" who="S0084">but the hinge always uses the catch and it was so it made it heavy cos it was a heavy weight</u>
<u n="1453" who="S0046">no <pause dur="short"/> it's <trunc>def</trunc> definitely a heavy door it is fire door <pause dur="short"/> it's an official fire door</u>
<u n="1454" who="S0041">is it?</u>
<u n="1455" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="1456" who="S0084">but the thing is she's complicit because she knows that we could <unclear/></u>

<u n="1460" who="S0046">it's got metal in it <pause dur="short"/> it's a proper fire door</u>
<u n="1461" who="S0084">it's pretty heavy like if you think about it when you've got the hinge on it</u>
<u n="1462" who="S0046" trans="overlap">it's a proper fire door</u>
<u n="1463" who="S0084">but the thing is she knows that we've always kept that propped open</u>
<u n="1464" who="S0041">mm</u>
