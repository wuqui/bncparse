<u n="75" who="S0144">for our future</u>
<u n="76" who="S0024">no I said I was gonna spend some time thinking about it</u>
<u n="77" who="S0144">oh</u>
<u n="78" who="S0024">about what to do <pause dur="short"/> you know like I <trunc>al</trunc> I always go oh let's just live <pause dur="short"/> in a suburb with a massive garden and grow vegetables and write a book but that's never gonna happen because I'm rubbish <pause dur="short"/> erm but this year I've decided my main goal</u>
<u n="79" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0024">this year my main goal is to improve my <pause dur="short"/> organisation and my self-discipline</u>
<u n="81" who="S0144">how are you gonna do that?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0024">by attempting to get things done as soon as I get them like you get that email through saying do your visa and you just go and do your visa straight away no dilly-dallying about no leaving it and then forgetting about the email and writing yourself and note and <pause dur="short"/> none of that just do it</u>
<u n="83" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0024">get it done <pause dur="short"/> that's my aim and I think I thought that and I'd like to start <pause dur="short"/> you know just messing about on the computer writing some stories and I thought well if I can improve my self-discipline then I've got more chance of any kind of work at home <pause dur="short"/> cos at the moment I'm rubbish at working from home</u>
<u n="85" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0024">now if I was doing <trunc>t</trunc> making materials or doing this or doing that I'd just stress myself out to bits it would just be <pause dur="short"/> it would be the most stressful job I could have with all these deadlines and <pause dur="short"/> approaching I'm be <trunc>fi</trunc> like it would just be on my mind for three weeks of the month and then in the last week it I'd be panicking <pause dur="short"/> something like that so I need to adjust my <pause dur="short"/> myself yeah that's my aim this year is to just get jobs done as they come</u>
<u n="87" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0024">and then I because I thought anything that we do in the future if we've got a chance of working from home it would be good but neither of us have the self-discipline to work from it <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="89" who="S0144">no</u>
<u n="90" who="S0024">so I need that skill</u>
<u n="91" who="S0144">I when we when we were in Oman <pause dur="short"/> I did</u>
<u n="92" who="S0024">not work from home but</u>
<u n="93" who="S0144">no but</u>
<u n="94" who="S0024">you had the discipline</u>
<u n="95" who="S0144">cos I had to</u>
<u n="96" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> had too much work to fit in that's why</u>
<u n="97" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think I'm always looking for how to make my life easier</u>
<u n="98" who="S0024">it doesn't make your life easier we have to</u>
<u n="99" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0024">do paperwork we have to do it</u>
<u n="101" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0024">and get it done</u>
<u n="103" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0024">otherwise it's just in your mind and then <pause dur="short"/> and then you rush about trying to do it and then you think it's really difficult for</u>
<u n="105" who="S0144" trans="overlap">that sounds like quite an easy aim to be honest</u>
<u n="106" who="S0024">no I don't think it is I've been trying to do it for twenty years like <pause dur="short"/> I've been trying to to to organise myself every year that that's one of my <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="107" who="S0144">all you need to do is just take action on <pause dur="short"/> the beginning</u>
<u n="108" who="S0024" trans="overlap">well can you do it then?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0024">right will you do the tax forms tonight?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> no</u>
<u n="112" who="S0024"><vocal desc="laugh"/> well then</u>
<u n="113" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="114" who="S0024">let's just get it all done</u>

<u n="120" who="S0024">look er look I've got it right next to me</u>
<u n="121" who="S0144">oh <pause dur="short"/> yeah well that's another aim</u>
<u n="122" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="123" who="S0144">just do your HS course the test</u>
<u n="124" who="S0024">no it doesn't matter about the test really but it's a good thing to <pause dur="short"/> aim for isn't it? to try and learn all the vocabulary</u>
<u n="125" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I think it's a good thing to do a test it's pretty cheap isn't it?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0144">to take it you might as well get it and stick it on your CV that you've got elementary</u>

<u n="132" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0144">and you're pretty much there already to get the elementary one</u>
<u n="134" who="S0024">I need vocabulary <pause dur="short"/> there's a bit of grammar I'm short on too that I keep forgetting</u>
<u n="135" who="S0144">yeah but</u>
<u n="136" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0144">I think that's a good thing</u>
<u n="138" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="139" who="S0144">I mean once you've got that</u>
<u n="140" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I can't believe <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s caught up so fast</u>
<u n="141" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0024">mm</u>

<u n="152" who="S0024">I've never been very good have I?</u>
<u n="153" who="S0144">well the main thing</u>
<u n="154" who="S0024" trans="overlap">it's</u>
<u n="155" who="S0144" trans="overlap">is just using it</u>
<u n="156" who="S0024">that's why</u>
<u n="157" who="S0144" trans="overlap">and not being shy about making mistakes</u>
<u n="158" who="S0024">yeah that's I've been <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s really really good in one way <pause dur="short"/> but in another way not so because she she does <pause dur="short"/> she doesn't ever correct me but she does give me if I'm struggling ways of saying things but she's really really good to talk to and she she works out what you're saying so easily not many people can do that</u>
<u n="159" who="S0144">mm</u>

<u n="162" who="S0024" trans="overlap">and I'm saying it completely wrong most of the time <pause dur="short"/> but what she doesn't pick me up on is my pronunciation she repeats it back to me completely different from what I've said <pause dur="short"/> and then er but she understands</u>
<u n="163" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="164" who="S0024">just from <pause dur="short"/> my gestures and things <pause dur="short"/> so I think when I go to speak to other people <pause dur="short"/> I'm not as good <pause dur="short"/> cos with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she she kind of knows what I'm talking about</u>
<u n="165" who="S0144">no but it's gonna be helpful though</u>
