<u n="264" who="S0405" trans="overlap">I think it's to do with fingerprints and stuff but yeah</u>
<u n="265" who="S0555">why does Macedonia why does why do Greece and Macedonia don't get on?</u>
<u n="266" who="S0405" trans="overlap">so erm the the long story is that erm Macedonia recognises itself as Macedonia</u>
<u n="267" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="268" who="S0405">and so do ninety percent of countries in the world</u>
<u n="269" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="270" who="S0405">but then Greece doesn't recognise it it recognises it as a you know the republic of Yugoslavia</u>

<u n="272" who="S0405" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="273" who="S0555">of Macedonia</u>
<u n="274" who="S0405">exactly erm and they don't accept it as that and so every time that any procedure to get them into the EU is you know brought up</u>
<u n="275" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="276" who="S0405">they bring up the issue of their name</u>

<u n="278" who="S0556"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="279" who="S0405" trans="overlap">and because Greece</u>
<u n="280" who="S0556" trans="overlap">that sounds so childish</u>
<u n="281" who="S0405" trans="overlap">it is</u>
<u n="282" who="S0555" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="283" who="S0556" trans="overlap">if you think about it</u>
<u n="284" who="S0405" trans="overlap">it really is</u>
<u n="285" who="S0556"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="286" who="S0405">it's so ridiculous and like I was looking on Wikipedia it's been going on for like twenty years and every single time they just bring up the issue of its name and because Greece is in the EU it gets an automatic <trunc>ve</trunc> well it gives a veto that and every time they just they just choose to veto it and so those procedures can't get through</u>
<u n="287" who="S0555" trans="overlap">so it's just because of its name?</u>
<u n="288" who="S0405">but the long story er the short story is that they don't want they don't want Macedonia in because as many EU countries they wanna protect their own interests</u>
<u n="289" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="290" who="S0405">if they bring in Macedonia look at all the the aid that is going into Greece they don't want they don't want the European Union to look at oh look there's lots of countries around here we need to distribute aid between all of them</u>
<u n="291" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="292" who="S0405">you know it's just them being selfish is er that's that's an opinion but</u>
<u n="293" who="S0555">oh</u>
<u n="294" who="S0405">basically they're being selfish and they don't want to er</u>
<u n="295" who="S0555">Macedonia why don't they just make naming Greek different?</u>
<u n="296" who="S0405"><vocal desc="laugh"/> erm</u>
<u n="297" who="S0556"><unclear/></u>
<u n="298" who="S0405">because they want to stop them getting into the EU erm it's just some long</u>
<u n="299" who="S0555">that's weird</u>
<u n="300" who="S0405" trans="overlap">political statement about it's really every other country in the world accepts it as erm well not every other country but</u>
<u n="301" who="S0555" trans="overlap">accept what?</u>
<u n="302" who="S0405">most countries in the world accept it as Macedonia but it's just Greece but</u>
<u n="303" who="S0555">and Kosovo isn't recognised by five countries</u>
<u n="304" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="305" who="S0555" trans="overlap">by five member states</u>
<u n="306" who="S0405" trans="overlap">as as an independent state</u>
<u n="307" who="S0555">so and it seems Serbia doesn't recognise it</u>
<u n="308" who="S0405">lots of these I mean this is the stuff we're doing er in history but it's just a geopolitically sensitive area <unclear/> and er a lot of these countries were formed erm so a hundred years ago when there was er there were all these different states and then there was there were two there was the Turkish Ottoman Empire and then there was</u>
<u n="309" who="S0555" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="310" who="S0405">erm the Prussian Empire</u>
<u n="311" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="312" who="S0405">and then there was an Austro-Hungarian Empire Austria and Hungary</u>
<u n="313" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="314" who="S0405">and so they started ended up through a series of wars er dividing up this area so Montenegro was formed purely to stop Serbia from getting access to this sea I dunno er there's either it's the Mediterranean or the Black Sea or the I dunno the this is the Adriatic Sea sorry</u>
<u n="315" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="316" who="S0405">erm so they simply didn't wanna give Serbia access to this body of water</u>
<u n="317" who="S0555">okay</u>
<u n="318" who="S0405" trans="overlap">obviously for trade purposes so it was purely created and recognised as an independent state because of that reason erm and so you can understand why some people are annoyed and pissed when they suddenly start demanding aid because erm because some countries don't recognise it or they want to protect their own interests it's just a difficult situation do you want a hoody? are you cold?</u>
<u n="319" who="S0555" trans="overlap">no it's fine I have it's cos I remember <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> explaining his version of erm</u>
<u n="320" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="321" who="S0555" trans="overlap">Kosovo</u>
<u n="322" who="S0405">uhu</u>
<u n="323" who="S0555" trans="overlap">of what er Kosovo he just and he was just basically there are loads of Albanian immigrants</u>
<u n="324" who="S0405">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="325" who="S0555" trans="overlap">who came to the area and they <trunc>h</trunc> and then they had lots and lots of children and they had <trunc>mu</trunc>much more children than erm the the Serbians that lived there</u>
<u n="326" who="S0405">oh I see</u>
<u n="327" who="S0555" trans="overlap">so they basically overpopulated it</u>
<u n="328" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="329" who="S0555">so he sort of said that they were kind of like settlers and stuff</u>
<u n="330" who="S0405">mm</u>
<u n="331" who="S0555">rather than actually living there</u>
<u n="332" who="S0405">yeah there's a lot of erm sort of <unclear/> exclusion or sort of er Romani people I didn't know that much about them until I researched it they're erm erm yeah they're socially excluded from tons of they're called gypsies but they're not the same gypsies as we have here but they're</u>
<u n="333" who="S0556" trans="overlap">oh yeah I've heard about that</u>
<u n="334" who="S0405" trans="overlap">they're just highly dispersed around Europe</u>
<u n="335" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="336" who="S0405">and erm</u>
<u n="337" who="S0555" trans="overlap">like those people they were killed in the Holocaust weren't they? like</u>
<u n="338" who="S0405" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="339" who="S0555" trans="overlap">three quarters of their population</u>
<u n="340" who="S0405" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah those kind of gypsies</u>
<u n="341" who="S0555" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="343" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0405">er</u>
<u n="345" who="S0555" trans="overlap">well you shouldn't call them gypsies you should call them</u>
<u n="346" who="S0405" trans="overlap">no no no it it's like slang term sorry but they're called gypsies erm and er and so I'm just trying to look at the reasons why <pause dur="short"/> poverty exists how we can solve it but I don't wanna get all into statistics there's so many studies and boring data</u>
<u n="347" who="S0555" trans="overlap">but you should don't shouldn't you need to know statistics and stuff?</u>
<u n="348" who="S0405" trans="overlap">yeah yeah so I'm gonna include statistics on the what should the EU do? because they've done all these these er programmes to see how different erm programmes work</u>
<u n="349" who="S0555">mm</u>
<u n="350" who="S0405" trans="overlap">and it's the poverty in these areas they're a lot more rural than urban poverty</u>
<u n="351" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="352" who="S0405" trans="overlap">so you know there's programmes er you know look at the way that agriculture has changed in the last ten years there is you know all the Fairtrade stuff that that's going on because it's people aren't getting paid enough</u>
<u n="353" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="354" who="S0405">erm and it's not just unemployment it's erm it's er er it's it's it's the er the amount that these jobs are paid so so the as in there's not a direct correlation to being employed and not being poor so if you can still be employed but be be poor in these areas</u>
<u n="355" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="356" who="S0405">it's about how well paid these jobs are</u>
<u n="357" who="S0555">mm</u>
<u n="358" who="S0405">cos some of these these jobs are underfunded or they're not paid enough erm so yeah I'm trying to combine all those factors for the</u>

<u n="2433" who="S0405">no I think it takes time for them to get indigestion or whatever they have <pause dur="short"/> erm here we go though although there were so many ideas</u>
<u n="2434" who="S0555">mm</u>
<u n="2435" who="S0405" trans="overlap">so people wanna talk about mental health and erm I think and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> suggested mental health people wanna talk about homelessness <unclear>I don't care about</unclear> poverty and inequality erm the wellbeing sessions are connected to that cos it's kind of about just building a responsibility so the way Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> cos I asked her what shall I do? cos so many ideas</u>
<u n="2436" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="2437" who="S0405">she <trunc>d</trunc> she thought the er the idea of fulfilment or personal fulfilment</u>
<u n="2438" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="2439" who="S0405">so what do we get from fulfilment from and what are you know tying in the idea of what er what are humans? what do we get fulfilment from? erm so that way you can bring in health erm you can bring in what it means to be humanity you know humanity you can bring in aid work humanitarian concerns so how how er you know some ideas of what how you get fulfilment so we can have like maybe break it into three categories or something and then we can just talk about each one erm <vocal desc="cough"/> so different ways to connect to charities so erm one of the ideas that Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> was saying was that you know it's hard to feel depressed or lacking fulfilment if you're helping the poor or if you're volunteering erm so maybe erm just discussing some of the ways people can volunteer or just discussing what gives people fulfilment so</u>
<u n="2440" who="S0555">okay</u>
<u n="2441" who="S0405" trans="overlap">that's connected to wellbeing because you're you're explaining how people can be better off</u>
<u n="2442" who="S0555">and</u>
<u n="2443" who="S0405" trans="overlap">erm</u>
<u n="2444" who="S0555">and we're not linking it to whatever charity we chose to?</u>
<u n="2445" who="S0405">erm</u>
<event desc="unintelligible"/>
<u n="2446" who="S0405">erm <pause dur="short"/> I think er yeah I think we can if if we want to if er if people have a strong passion for a charity then they might as well talk about that charity</u>
<u n="2447" who="S0555">did we not choose a charity?</u>
<u n="2448" who="S0405">no</u>
<u n="2449" who="S0555">okay</u>
<u n="2450" who="S0405">erm I think I think rather than just choosing one we'll just work through the year as it comes</u>
<u n="2451" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="2452" who="S0405" trans="overlap">because we don't fully know what we're gonna do yet</u>
<u n="2453" who="S0555">sure</u>
<u n="2454" who="S0405">erm <vocal desc="cough"/> so this idea that a lot of the time with fulfilment</u>
<u n="2455" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="2456" who="S0405" trans="overlap">there's a focus on the individual and yourself</u>
<u n="2457" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="2458" who="S0405">the self but a lot of the time we get fulfilment from being with other people or from helping other people</u>
<u n="2459" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="2460" who="S0405">whereas that's not something that's usually taught or discussed and told to people so you know putting that message across that volunteering and being with friends and stuff like that can give you just as much fulfilment as what you think personal fulfilment is right?</u>
<u n="2461" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="2462" who="S0405">erm <pause dur="short"/> erm so one idea she had was to er which is one of the things she does when she teaches wellbeing erm is er to have <unclear/> sorry it's dark it's low battery so you have cos er I I said you know one of the things we were talking about was we wanna get them thinking we wanna get them involved</u>
<u n="2463" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="2464" who="S0405">so show a series of images and just ask what this means to them what they think</u>
<u n="2465" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="2466" who="S0405">get the response from that so that's a broken nail</u>
<u n="2467" who="S0555">okay</u>
<u n="2468" who="S0405">so think how that connects to your wellbeing I mean a lot of people would get very upset if they broke a nail does it actually impact your health? or what about other sides of wellbeing in terms of erm <pause dur="short"/> erm you know your actual personal wellbeing rather than just <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't call that materialistic but you know what you consider to be your wellbeing</u>
<u n="2469" who="S0555">uhu</u>
<u n="2470" who="S0405">erm I think that's just arguing with people <pause dur="short"/> that's a homeless guy <pause dur="short"/> er you know that's war <pause dur="short"/> miners' strike obviously we can change these to whatever we wanna be that's drought in America I mean what you know how does he feel fulfilled or not fulfilled? that's er a bird covered in oil</u>
<u n="2471" who="S0555">ah</u>
<u n="2472" who="S0405">from a oil spill <pause dur="short"/> that's the Vietnam picture of the girl that's covered in napalm and that's that a monkey in a cage that's a funeral I think? <pause dur="short"/> it looks like people wading through water <pause dur="short"/> disabled <pause dur="short"/> I think that's the Holocaust</u>
<u n="2473" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="2474" who="S0405">so as I said we can just use whatever we want but that's what she tends to use so maybe starting off with that when we ask the question what does it mean to be fulfilled or how do you feel fulfilled in your life then we go through those maybe discuss it a little bit erm</u>
<u n="2475" who="S0555" trans="overlap">and so then we're just gonna sort of link that to the idea of humanitarian action</u>
<u n="2476" who="S0405">yeah so <pause dur="short"/> erm maybe we could use examples of charities things that they can do what are what a humanitarian club does</u>
<u n="2477" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="2478" who="S0405">I erm <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>

<u n="2530" who="S0555" trans="overlap">whatever we want</u>
<u n="2531" who="S0405" trans="overlap">the overall theme is personal fulfilment we talk about different <pause dur="short"/> ways people get fulfilled and then we talk about how helping charities and how charities <pause dur="short"/> help people to be fulfilled or how <trunc>h</trunc> they help <pause dur="short"/> how the volunteers themselves get fulfilled I mean it's different takes we can do on it it depends how we feel really or what we wanna what message we wanna put across</u>

<u n="2535" who="S0405" trans="overlap">stuff all that mental wellbeing talking about more about mental health like differentiated from anxiety what do you think we can talk about in that respect? I think the point there we're trying to make is that not many people see it as a serious issue</u>
<u n="2536" who="S0556">yeah</u>

<u n="2540" who="S0556">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="2541" who="S0405">but I think those mental illnesses are heavily misunderstood so maybe just a few minutes on what it actually is and what it actually feels to be mentally <trunc>un</trunc> er you know have one of those conditions maybe there's a video we could find erm <unclear/></u>
<u n="2542" who="S0555">the thing is like if we just play a video</u>
<u n="2543" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="2544" who="S0555" trans="overlap">what's the point of having a presentation?</u>
<u n="2545" who="S0405" trans="overlap">exactly yeah exactly</u>
<u n="2546" who="S0555">but erm if we're doing it about mental health we could easily link it to a charity</u>
<u n="2547" who="S0405">yeah</u>
<u n="2548" who="S0555">we could make it kind of I don't know how we would do it cos what would we talk about about</u>
<u n="2549" who="S0405" trans="overlap">it's brain stuff</u>
<u n="2550" who="S0555" trans="overlap">mental health?</u>
<u n="2551" who="S0405">it's brain stuff erm just er what it means to</u>
<u n="2552" who="S0555" trans="overlap">are we talking about like mental health in general statistics in the UK or how it relates to them?</u>
<u n="2553" who="S0405">how it relates to them is important maybe I mean who are we targeting? are we just want anyone who suffers from that any anything like that to know it's okay maybe to know that they can get help</u>
<u n="2554" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="2555" who="S0405" trans="overlap">cos we can talk about like there's people in school like Mrs <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> or or our teachers</u>
<u n="2556" who="S0555" trans="overlap">outside of school they could</u>
<u n="2557" who="S0405" trans="overlap">Mrs <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> or outside school</u>
<u n="2558" who="S0555" trans="overlap">I guess cos our cos er everyone would be old enough to make their own doctor's appointment and stuff so they</u>
<u n="2559" who="S0405" trans="overlap">uhu</u>
<u n="2560" who="S0555">really need to go through</u>
<u n="2561" who="S0405">yeah</u>

<u n="2572" who="S0405">we're gonna pitch it differently hopefully obviously you know sixth formers sixth formers are smart I mean</u>
<u n="2573" who="S0555">well</u>
<u n="2574" who="S0405" trans="overlap">we don't need to spoon-feed them basic primary school information but I still think there's a misunderstanding about mental health</u>
<u n="2575" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="2576" who="S0405">so erm <vocal desc="cough"/> we can talk about it's still not enough <pause dur="long"/></u>

<u n="2589" who="S0405">right so personal fulfilment so we're talking about health erm <pause dur="short"/> broader issues for now what would you call fulfilment from being with friends or helping other people? shall we do that separately</u>

<u n="2606" who="S0555" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2607" who="S0405">or maybe just be altruistic to help yourself not just to help other people I think maybe there's a there's too much of a focus on oh you know it's all about helping that poor kid in Africa what about the benefits you get yourself from it? so that's kind of what Miss <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> talked about in her er scholars' talk last year</u>
<u n="2608" who="S0555" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2609" who="S0405">but so maybe we could link in the benefits of volunteering? er probably not for the year thirteens cos they've done most of that but getting that message through to year twelve is important</u>
<u n="2610" who="S0555">yeah</u>
<u n="2611" who="S0405" trans="overlap">cos this is the time that they have they don't have the time but they have time now and that's gonna be vital when they <unclear>come to do that</unclear></u>

<u n="3113" who="S0405">complex</u>
