<u n="9" who="S0018">no not really <pause dur="short"/> I never really got into eating loads of cheese in France <pause dur="short"/> um but I miss the vegetables from Spain <pause dur="short"/> cos oo sorry <pause dur="short"/> okay here you are <pause dur="short"/> um if you go to like if you went to the market</u>
<u n="10" who="S0170">mhm</u>

<u n="12" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0018">for about ten euros <pause dur="short"/> and that would sort you out all for all the week <pause dur="short"/> um and obviously here most of I don't there there just aren't any markets <pause dur="short"/> they you've got the the Bullring market in <anon type="place"/> but</u>
<u n="14" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="15" who="S0018">I just don't like it <pause dur="short"/> it's so unappetizing <pause dur="short"/> it's a bit smelly <pause dur="short"/> um</u>

<u n="23" who="S0018">yeah so I buy most of my vegetables from supermarkets <pause dur="short"/> which I don't like doing cos I know it's not ethical like if ever there's an offer on it's not the the supermarket that takes the hit of the price</u>
<u n="24" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0018">it's the</u>
<u n="26" who="S0170">the farmers</u>
<u n="27" who="S0018">the producers <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0170">well that's why in my family there used to be about eight farms <pause dur="short"/> and now we <trunc>ha</trunc> we the last one was sold about last year <pause dur="short"/> and it's because of supermarkets <pause dur="short"/> because they were all smallholdings <pause dur="short"/> they weren't large farms</u>
<u n="29" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0170">and they just couldn't keep up with the prices that people were asking for meat and things like that</u>
<u n="31" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0170">it was ridiculous</u>
<u n="33" who="S0018">it's such a shame isn't it</u>
<u n="34" who="S0170">mm <pause dur="short"/> so many smallholding farms have closed because of that <pause dur="short"/> and they were pretty much organic <pause dur="short"/> cos that was the way things were done</u>
<u n="35" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0170">before</u>
<u n="37" who="S0018">are you sure that's warm enough?</u>

<u n="44" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="45" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no in an ideal world I'd grow stuff in the garden</u>
<u n="46" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="47" who="S0018">obviously in Spain that was easier cos it was fantastic weather and conditions for</u>
<u n="48" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0018">they put</u>
<u n="50" who="S0170">they don't have houses that have gardens though do they?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> in Granada there weren't so many gardens</u>
<u n="52" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0018">unless you lived in the outskirts <pause dur="short"/> well here in Moseley they've got fantastic initiative um for allotments</u>
<u n="54" who="S0170">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> my <trunc>da</trunc> my dad has an allotment</u>
<u n="55" who="S0018">and I've heard in in like dodgy areas of Birmingham as well they've got er there's some charity that that um organizes allotments for the neighbours and gets them together to work together <pause dur="short"/> and apparently it's stopped a lot of social <trunc>s</trunc> strife</u>
<u n="56" who="S0170">really?</u>
<u n="57" who="S0018">problems with gang-related issues and things <pause dur="short"/> I guess a a lot of people in those circumstances you know they're not working cos they can't find work <pause dur="short"/> you know they're very territorial <pause dur="short"/> any kind of territorial problems are just gonna come out with violence <pause dur="short"/> but if they're all working together</u>
<u n="58" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="59" who="S0018">they've got an objective <pause dur="short"/> and that objective provides them all food</u>
<u n="60" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0018">it's it encourages a lot more <trunc>col</trunc> collaboration and cooperation and</u>

<u n="72" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0170">and to be honest I don't think he'll ever give it up <pause dur="short"/> even if he thought I'm not making enough money</u>
<u n="74" who="S0018">well it's nice to <trunc>wor</trunc> work with things when you can make them grow and</u>
<u n="75" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0018">especially if you can eat them after <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0170">and he has his allotment <pause dur="short"/> well he had an allotment then he stopped it cos he said that nothing would grow <pause dur="short"/> it was one in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> and he said nothing would grow there <pause dur="short"/> even though he made his own um manure <pause dur="short"/> compost</u>
