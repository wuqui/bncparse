<u n="14" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0202">it's horrible listening back to my voice cos I have to listen to like the first five minutes so when I'm filling forms in erm I have to erm listen to the first five minutes to ascertain what it is <unclear/></u>
<u n="16" who="S0203" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="17" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="18" who="S0203"><unclear/> single word after <unclear/></u>
<u n="19" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/> but nine grand a year fucking hell</u>
<u n="20" who="S0203"><unclear/> I don't do an English degree know what the world has to say <unclear/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0203">take it down <unclear/></u>
<u n="23" who="S0202">yeah so nine grand just to explain a word that I already know but erm</u>
<u n="24" who="S0203">I know some pretty big words too I can teach you them if you want <unclear/></u>
<u n="25" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/> what right okay think of some big word that you know then</u>
<u n="26" who="S0203">er you've got to use them in context though you can't just blurt out a word cos if you think of a big word</u>
<u n="27" who="S0202">is your is your is is</u>
<u n="28" who="S0203" trans="overlap">the biggest word I know is <trunc>antidisest</trunc>antidisestablishmentarianism</u>
<u n="29" who="S0202">that is actually the longest word in the English language</u>
<u n="30" who="S0203" trans="overlap">yeah it is <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0202">erm do you know what if I say this okay so your vocabulary is exponential</u>
<u n="32" who="S0203">er it grows as I go along</u>
<u n="33" who="S0202">mm mm</u>
<u n="34" who="S0203"><unclear/> exponential grows so there you go I'm not an idiot</u>
<u n="35" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="36" who="S0203">you're talking about fucking basic words like <unclear/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0202" trans="overlap">to be fair my friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she did the erm er international baccalaureate so she did it's like the hardest thing ever it's like A levels but you do nine so she didn't she did nine subjects at A level for two years and erm she didn't know what exponential meant I had to explain it to her so it's not even down to your intelligence it just means what words you come across</u>
<u n="38" who="S0203" trans="overlap">yeah but like you say <unclear/> well read so you read more words than I <unclear/> that are relevant as well</u>
<u n="39" who="S0202">yeah I mean I have a list</u>
<u n="40" who="S0203"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0202">if I come across a word like I put it down and then like look up look at it later like I have this app and it on my phone and it basically gives me five new words a day to learn</u>
<u n="42" who="S0203">oh right <unclear/></u>
<u n="43" who="S0202">so like every day five new words'll come up and if they're already in my vocabulary if I already know what they mean I click on them and say I know what these mean and give me some more</u>
<u n="44" who="S0203">do you do what I do and when you say a big word you smirk? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="45" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="46" who="S0203"><unclear/></u>
<u n="47" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/> make it sound like he does not know what that means I'm a genius</u>
<u n="48" who="S0203"><unclear/> win conversations when I'm like <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/> a big word</u>
<u n="49" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0203">and like</u>
<u n="51" who="S0202">and then they're confused</u>
<u n="52" who="S0203" trans="overlap">really is a lot of them in music as well because obviously it's like an extra subject to do something you've never really done</u>
<u n="53" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0203">I could sit here saying all sorts of words to you and you won't have a clue what I'm on about</u>
<u n="55" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="56" who="S0203">and really basic ones as well so for basic for me would be saying like a you know the song Don't Look Back In Anger by Oasis yeah?</u>
<u n="57" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<event desc="sound of bottles"/>
<u n="58" who="S0203">that song is in a key of C that's fairly understandable yeah?</u>
<u n="59" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="60" who="S0203">and it uses a chord progression on the one four five six with a <trunc>min</trunc> with a minor two and you wouldn't have a clue if that was right and it wasn't right</u>
<u n="61" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I have no idea</u>
<u n="62" who="S0203">I can fill you full of bullshit all day and you wouldn't know it's <unclear/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0202" trans="overlap">oh my god</u>
<u n="64" who="S0203">but it is pretty cool to know music because now I'm at a point where I can listen to a song and by the end of the song I've already learnt it all apart from the words cos obviously I need to remember the words</u>
<u n="65" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0203">but if it's something like a song any any pop song I can pretty much know by the end of it because they're all common <unclear/></u>
<u n="67" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah they all use the same music notes alright</u>
<u n="68" who="S0203">chord progressive</u>
<u n="69" who="S0202">yeah chord progressive</u>
<event desc="sound of bottle"/>
<u n="70" who="S0203"><unclear/></u>
<u n="71" who="S0202">so <vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="72" who="S0203">ah <unclear/> I haven't buttoned this up in years</u>
<u n="73" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="74" who="S0202">so do you know erm how to play any instrument or is it just guitar or drums or what?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0203"><unclear/> it apply so</u>
<u n="76" who="S0202">cos it all <unclear>applies</unclear> the same right?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0203">it sort of yes I don't know how to play a trumpet or trombone cos they're all you have to have skill <unclear/> but what I do know is that erm on a trumpet it's not like a guitar where you can stroke like a six-finger guitar you combine all the notes together to make a chord to play trumpet you can play one note you can't play a chord</u>
<u n="78" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0203">the way you get a chord it's like getting three trumpets to play all at the same time you don't want a third a third of the fifth of chord on a different note</u>
<u n="80" who="S0202">okay right</u>
<u n="81" who="S0203">yeah <unclear/> the chord or whatever er and that's that's how er that's how you play a chord but I didn't know that when I <unclear/> play off <unclear/> but no if I ever played trumpet I'd know straight away you can't do this this and this you can do this this and this er I can play guitar and because I can play guitar I can play bass violin cello all that sort of stuff to a certain standard</u>
<u n="82" who="S0202" trans="overlap">same sort of instrument</u>
<u n="83" who="S0203">yeah cymbal</u>
<u n="84" who="S0202">yeah okay</u>
<u n="85" who="S0203">I can play drums erm purely because one of my mates showed me how to and then you start playing like you do with anything you start playing sequences and stuff so you realise that it's not it looks like you can play on your arms like a <unclear/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="87" who="S0203">all you really do is count in <unclear/> there go one two three four da da da da do and it all starts to become a sequence it all</u>
<u n="88" who="S0202">right</u>
<u n="89" who="S0203">it gets really boring after this but</u>
<u n="90" who="S0202">so I wouldn't be able to I probably wouldn't be able to do it then cos of my <unclear/> with sequences</u>
<u n="91" who="S0203" trans="overlap">possibly possibly yes cos like erm the the easier you do it the four four rock beat which is you using everything yeah it does you count four on your high hat which is the symbol yeah which is one two three four on the one you press your kick pedal</u>
<u n="92" who="S0202">right</u>
<u n="93" who="S0203">on three you press your <unclear/> dum da da da one two three four</u>
<u n="94" who="S0202">oh yeah if they don't have any coordination I couldn't play drums</u>
<u n="95" who="S0203">yeah so well it's all about just learning it the once it's not hard it's just putting the time in to learn it and there's a thing called the ten thousand hours theory where if you put ten thousand hours into learning anything</u>
<u n="96" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0203">you're good at it but you just have to put that ten thousand hours in</u>
<u n="98" who="S0202">right okay keep doing it for ten thousand hours</u>
<u n="99" who="S0203">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0203">or there's a theory like if you do something for twenty-seven days no matter what it is like erm if you go to the gym every day for twenty-seven days it's then in your memory in your muscle memory and everything you want to go back again so if you can stick with something for twenty-seven days chances are you can stick with it forever</u>
<u n="102" who="S0202">really?</u>
<u n="103" who="S0203">so if you want to do your five <unclear/> challenge make sure you do it for a month</u>
<u n="104" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0203">and after that month you'll want to do it because it's coming <unclear/> if you know what I mean</u>
<u n="106" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0203">that's an interesting theory I know loads all about the theories</u>
<u n="108" who="S0202">do you know anything about erm the string theory? see I have to concentrate then when I'm being serious <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="109" who="S0203">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0202">I have to concentrate</u>
<u n="111" who="S0203">yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0202"><unclear>otherwise</unclear> I'll just say theory not theory</u>
<u n="113" who="S0203" trans="overlap">I was only joking about that I'm not <unclear/></u>
<u n="114" who="S0202" trans="overlap">I know but I'm trying to like con my dentist into thinking that I need a brace for free because</u>
<u n="115" who="S0203"><vocal desc="laugh"/> so you've done a list?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0203">now I've got <unclear/></u>
<u n="118" who="S0202" trans="overlap">that's what I'm trying to</u>
<u n="119" who="S0203" trans="overlap"><unclear/> leave the house</u>
<u n="120" who="S0202"><unclear/> no but I do have a speech impediment I can't I physically can't there's some words that I can't say because I can say them but</u>
<u n="121" who="S0203"><unclear>ridged thick</unclear> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="122" who="S0202">well yeah thick thick</u>
<u n="123" who="S0203">in the English degree</u>
<u n="124" who="S0202">like I I actually have to concentrate like saying things like thick or three or erm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0203">yeah but <unclear>only</unclear> if you wanted to say them correctly if you want to get your point across I can mumble for an hour and you can kinda get what I'm saying</u>
<u n="126" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0203">so you don't have to like express every <unclear/></u>

<u n="131" who="S0203" trans="overlap">you know I think you know from what I can gather you're very similar to me yeah and I think I've tried to like self-diagnose over the years and what I think it is people always look at me like I'm being a dick when I say like er it's not that <unclear>man's</unclear> great he's too quick yeah it's that my mouth's really slow</u>
<u n="132" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="134" who="S0202">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="135" who="S0203">so well I'm thinking things too quick and my mouth can't keep up with the thought I think</u>
<u n="136" who="S0202" trans="overlap">same with me yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0203">but you'll say things and occasionally you'll see me go er da da da da da da da da da and then I'll get into the speech cos I'm trying and my brain's <unclear/> that like fast and I can't keep up with that I'm trying to say something but</u>
<u n="138" who="S0202">it comes out yeah it's the same with me though because sometimes say I'll be sat here and will not have said anything for five minutes just watching telly or whatever and I'll sit I'll oh yeah so you know this and blah blah blah and people are just like what the fuck are you talking about?
