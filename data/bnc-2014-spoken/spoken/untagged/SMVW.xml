<u n="179" who="S0392">so we have our mocks in January</u>
<u n="180" who="S0390">yes</u>
<u n="181" who="S0392">and this is the erm <pause dur="short"/> a little preparation one just to give you an idea <pause dur="short"/> but erm</u>
<u n="182" who="S0390">timing wise</u>
<u n="183" who="S0392" trans="overlap"><trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> yeah you can't get the past papers online because it's the ones that</u>
<u n="184" who="S0390" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="185" who="S0392">they've just done this summer</u>
<u n="186" who="S0390">yes</u>
<u n="187" who="S0392">so <trunc>th</trunc> you can't go and find the answers on the internet which you can for all the other topics <pause dur="short"/> and it's</u>
<u n="188" who="S0390" trans="overlap">just hang on <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>h</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> you <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> can you get the papers the past papers?</u>
<u n="189" who="S0392">er you can do but they haven't put these ones up yet so only teachers with a special login can get access to them access to them so it's <trunc>y</trunc> yeah so we're okay</u>
<u n="190" who="S0390" trans="overlap">okay yeah yeah yeah I understand yes</u>
<u n="191" who="S0392">we can't go find out the answers <pause dur="short"/> but it's biology tomorrow <pause dur="short"/> thursday it's physics and Friday it's chemistry so we've got them all covered in</u>
<u n="192" who="S0390" trans="overlap">hey now that's hard</u>
<u n="193" who="S0392">it's not easy</u>
<u n="194" who="S0390" trans="overlap">that's really hard <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> how long's each paper did you say?</u>
<u n="195" who="S0392">well in the real thing it'll be an hour <pause dur="short"/> each and you get three in each science so there's one two three</u>
<u n="196" who="S0390" trans="overlap"><unclear>good</unclear></u>
<u n="197" who="S0392">in biology and each <unclear>from that somehow</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what they're gonna do for this one it might they might just be doing half an hour because it's not <pause dur="short"/> a full unit they were doing it's sort of a bit of two <pause dur="short"/> and in chemistry it overlaps over some papers so there's some bits of paper two involved so <trunc>i</trunc> there won't be an exact paper but it'll just be <pause dur="short"/> some questions and it'll equate to about <pause dur="short"/> that anyway yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0390">are you telling me that you have <trunc>fil</trunc>finished the syllabus?</u>
<u n="199" who="S0392">not yet no we've still got another <trunc>u</trunc> we've still got unit three to do after our mocks</u>
<u n="200" who="S0390">and what does unit three mean?</u>
<u n="201" who="S0392">unit three is cells organs and populations enzymes and genetics</u>
<u n="202" who="S0390">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> populations</u>
<u n="203" who="S0392">that's like population so like a population of daisies or a population of animals and <unclear>all</unclear> so yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="204" who="S0390" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> I thought it was going to be a human population</u>
<u n="205" who="S0392">no that's geography <pause dur="short"/> oh sorry that's the unit two I've read out there</u>
<u n="206" who="S0390" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="207" who="S0392">unit three is life processes and humans and their environment <pause dur="short"/> which a lot especially humans in their environment is a lot shorter so that would be quite quick <unclear>for me</unclear></u>
<u n="208" who="S0390">is that where? <pause dur="short"/> erm <trunc>h</trunc> is it demographics?</u>
<u n="209" who="S0392">er no that's geography again it's more like erm <pause dur="short"/> humans deforestation and food production things</u>
<u n="210" who="S0390" trans="overlap">right yes</u>
<u n="211" who="S0392">so it's quite current anyway yeah</u>
<u n="212" who="S0390" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="213" who="S0392">things I've already done unit unit one is human biology environment and evolution <pause dur="short"/> unit two is cells organs populations enzymes and genetics <pause dur="short"/> unit three is life processes and humans and their environment so there's <pause dur="short"/> loads of stuff and they expect you to know it all all those <pause dur="short"/> hundred pages</u>
<u n="214" who="S0390">do you select? do you look at past papers? and see what's come up? and try to go</u>
<u n="215" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> a lot of</u>
<u n="216" who="S0390" trans="overlap">your granddad used to do that all the time</u>
<u n="217" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah a lot of the time the questions <pause dur="short"/> come back round again as well as I said there's like <pause dur="short"/> a six mark question on each paper <pause dur="short"/> and that's you've got to be a bit more thinking in that <pause dur="short"/> as opposed to those that are just a memory test</u>
<u n="218" who="S0390" trans="overlap">okay <pause dur="short"/> is it like an essay you have to do for that or?</u>
<u n="219" who="S0392">well they're trying to make it more essay based so people can't say that oh it's science it's all memory do you know what I mean? they're trying to make it more <pause dur="short"/> it isn't <pause dur="short"/> but they're trying to make it more like that <pause dur="short"/> by the looks of it</u>
<u n="220" who="S0390">well that used to be the gap between O levels and A levels <pause dur="short"/> you know your O levels <pause dur="short"/> at</u>
<u n="221" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="222" who="S0390" trans="overlap">my time were erm memory based</u>
<u n="223" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="224" who="S0390">and then you got a shock when you're expected to think</u>
<u n="225" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> a levels are a combination of both</u>
<u n="226" who="S0390">yeah yeah uhu</u>
<u n="227" who="S0392" trans="overlap">that's in <trunc>scien</trunc> A but the other subjects it tends to be a bit more even really there's a lot of thinking involved <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="228" who="S0390">right is <trunc>i</trunc> when I look at your textbook</u>
<u n="229" who="S0392">yeah?</u>
<u n="230" who="S0390">erm it looks inviting</u>
<u n="231" who="S0392">it does yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="232" who="S0390">compared to what we had</u>
<u n="233" who="S0392" trans="overlap">it has to be really cos you spend so much <trunc>stu</trunc>staring into it do you know what I mean it has to be <pause dur="short"/> they underline words I think that's a bit random really cos there just don't there seems to be no order to which words they underline but there's plenty of colours diagrams and things and there's a few jokes at the bottom as well it's the ones that every school uses really <pause dur="short"/> I think that</u>
<u n="234" who="S0390" trans="overlap">yes I've seen I've seen them</u>
<u n="235" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="236" who="S0390"><trunc>i</trunc> you know for <trunc>a</trunc>all subjects</u>
<u n="237" who="S0392">yes they do all subjects all exam boards</u>
<u n="238" who="S0390">yeah</u>
<u n="239" who="S0392">CGP</u>
<u n="240" who="S0390" trans="overlap">our own exam <pause dur="short"/> you know your <pause dur="short"/> your syllabus <pause dur="short"/> is covered in there <pause dur="short"/> but in the</u>
<u n="241" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah because this is the AQA edition <pause dur="short"/> exam board AQA you can buy one for Edexcel OCR <trunc>whiche</trunc> whichever board you do <pause dur="short"/> our school has sort of like a thing for AQA most of them are on that exam board <pause dur="short"/> so we're lucky so</u>
<u n="242" who="S0390">so you're lucky <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="243" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's one or two that aren't but other schools and that use other ones which is why there's a different edition <pause dur="short"/> cos it's different content in it with <trunc>in</trunc> different ways of</u>
<u n="244" who="S0390">but will that <trunc>ha</trunc> you you said A for A to A? no?</u>
<u n="245" who="S0392" trans="overlap">AQA</u>
<u n="246" who="S0390">is that your exam board?</u>
<u n="247" who="S0392">yeah Assessment and Qualifications Association</u>
<u n="248" who="S0390">okay <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> is it not like you used to do <pause dur="short"/> one biology book covered all syllabuses</u>
<u n="249" who="S0392">er you can get one of those and it shows and it points out which bits are but the third for if you're in a rush and you're trying to find out and you're looking for that it's a lot easier if <pause dur="short"/> you can just have one book and then you know <pause dur="short"/> that's <unclear>any</unclear></u>
<u n="250" who="S0390" trans="overlap">I would think it would I would prefer that</u>
<u n="251" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="252" who="S0390">because sometimes <pause dur="short"/> if it's got all the syllabuses on you see something and you think I don't know that</u>
<u n="253" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="254" who="S0390">and you might get a sudden fright think I haven't done it</u>
<u n="255" who="S0392" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0390" trans="overlap">oh no <pause dur="short"/> so you're having <pause dur="short"/> biology tomorrow</u>
<u n="257" who="S0392">yeah and then Thursday and Friday's physics and chemistry yeah</u>
<u n="258" who="S0390" trans="overlap">chemistry and physics? <pause dur="short"/> wow <pause dur="short"/> erm do you get time off to do <trunc>a</trunc><trunc>a</trunc> is it study leave?</u>
<u n="259" who="S0392" trans="overlap">no it's in the lesson no <pause dur="short"/> we don't get study leave no</u>
<u n="260" who="S0390">but will you?</u>
<u n="261" who="S0392" trans="overlap">well this these are just sort of like <trunc>s</trunc> tests in school <pause dur="short"/> they're not official run by the school they're run by the department</u>
<u n="262" who="S0390">ah yes</u>
<u n="263" who="S0392" trans="overlap">for these <pause dur="short"/> the actual mocks are run by the school</u>
<u n="264" who="S0390">yes</u>
<u n="265" who="S0392">but still you don't get it then <pause dur="short"/> these are sort of like assessments that you would do in year seven eight nine ten and everything <pause dur="short"/> it's it's all of that <pause dur="short"/> of that</u>
<u n="266" who="S0390">yeah ah</u>
<u n="267" who="S0392" trans="overlap">type</u>
<u n="268" who="S0390">so you're</u>
<u n="269" who="S0392">yes</u>
<u n="270" who="S0390">quite comfortable with them?</u>
<u n="271" who="S0392">yeah I mean there's not a huge amount riding on them <pause dur="short"/> the worst they do if you do really badly is they'll look at your previous record and if it is questionable <pause dur="short"/> suggest to your parents or whoever <pause dur="short"/> that they think you should maybe drop down and not do triple science which is where you do a separate GCSE in all three</u>
<u n="272" who="S0390" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah mm</u>
<u n="273" who="S0392" trans="overlap">instead <pause dur="short"/> just do core science which is <pause dur="short"/> cos what it is is each one has got three units as we say unit one unit two unit three</u>
<u n="274" who="S0390" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> so there's nine units altogether?</u>
<u n="275" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah so if if you do drop down all you do is you <trunc>d</trunc> still do biology chemistry physics but you only do unit one and two you don't do unit three <pause dur="short"/> and then it's called <pause dur="short"/> core science</u>
<u n="276" who="S0390">ah right I got it yes</u>
<u n="277" who="S0392" trans="overlap">you yeah you do core science which is</u>
<u n="278" who="S0391" trans="overlap"><unclear>okay <pause dur="short"/> bye</unclear></u>
<u n="279" who="S0392">the unit ones</u>
<u n="280" who="S0390">mm</u>
<u n="281" who="S0391">did you say you had a <unclear/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> yeah?</u>
<u n="282" who="S0390" trans="overlap">and it's just one paper for unit ones or it might be three papers I dunno and then you do additional science which is the unit twos</u>
<u n="283" who="S0391" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="284" who="S0390">so you three unit twos</u>
<u n="285" who="S0392" trans="overlap">you don't do the <pause dur="short"/> yeah and three unit ones <pause dur="short"/> you don't do that as opposed to in erm previously they've done where you drop a whole science and you still do all three units in it in this you still do all but you don't do it in as much depth</u>
<u n="286" who="S0390">right <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> but that'll give you three sciences won't it?</u>
<u n="287" who="S0391" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="288" who="S0392" trans="overlap">it will yeah</u>
<u n="289" who="S0393" trans="overlap">so have you worked out biology then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>? has he taught you?</u>
<u n="290" who="S0392" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="291" who="S0390">well actually it's not biology it's and I haven't even got to grips with <pause dur="short"/> what's happening and how they do it so <pause dur="short"/> you know?</u>
<u n="292" who="S0393">what the study methodology and everything <event desc="sound of acoustic guitar"/></u>
<u n="293" who="S0390">how those books work <pause dur="short"/> and how you sort it out between the different examining boards <pause dur="short"/> and I now know that they've got three papers <pause dur="short"/> for each subject <event desc="sound of acoustic guitar"/></u>
<u n="294" who="S0390">and <pause dur="short"/> they haven't tackled the second one <trunc>y</trunc> third one yet</u>
<u n="295" who="S0393">oh</u>
<u n="296" who="S0392">that's right <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah we've done <pause dur="short"/> in chemistry we've done a little bit <pause dur="short"/> but then</u>
<u n="297" who="S0393" trans="overlap">exciting innit?</u>
<u n="298" who="S0392" trans="overlap">but then <pause dur="short"/> we haven't done all <pause dur="short"/> erm unit two in that so erm it it sort of</u>
<u n="299" who="S0390">yes but you've a long time to know</u>
<u n="300" who="S0392" trans="overlap"><unclear>between er</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah there's plenty of time <pause dur="short"/> we've <pause dur="short"/> er when it's the mocks you still only do unit one and two you don't do unit three at the mocks <pause dur="short"/> but that you've still got <pause dur="short"/> january February March April to do it four months and start revising in May for the exams in June and July so there's no rush</u>
<u n="301" who="S0390">ah you'll be okay</u>
<u n="302" who="S0392">yeah yeah it's nothing really</u>
<u n="303" who="S0390" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean <pause dur="short"/> have you <trunc>d</trunc> have you done any so far?</u>
<u n="304" who="S0392">erm <pause dur="short"/> some people in some groups did core science <pause dur="short"/> paper one or two or whatever which erm</u>
<u n="305" who="S0390">yeah</u>
<u n="306" who="S0392">was the unit ones they did that last summer</u>
<u n="307" who="S0390">yes</u>
<u n="308" who="S0392">erm they've got the results some of them are resitting that some of them are not <pause dur="short"/> which is erm but we haven't we haven't done we've what you do as well that each paper is worth each sort of sorry each three <trunc>pa</trunc> each unit</u>
<u n="309" who="S0390">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="310" who="S0392" trans="overlap">is worth twenty-five <pause dur="short"/> that's right yeah you've <unclear>put</unclear> twenty-five percent of your GCSE <pause dur="short"/> which adds up to seventy-five percent</u>
<u n="311" who="S0390">just a minute I'm getting mixed up here <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> the way you're doing it</u>
<u n="312" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="313" who="S0390">for your <trunc>sa</trunc> for biology</u>
<u n="314" who="S0392">er yeah let's stick with biology actually</u>
<u n="315" who="S0390" trans="overlap">which is <trunc>com</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> you'll have to do three papers</u>
<u n="316" who="S0392">that's right unit one unit two unit three each one lasts an hour</u>
<u n="317" who="S0390" trans="overlap">you're doing each thing got it got it yes</u>
<u n="318" who="S0392">that however twenty-five twenty-five twenty-five doesn't take a mathematician to work out that that's only seventy-five and not a hundred</u>
<u n="319" who="S0390">so</u>
<u n="320" who="S0392">so where does</u>
<u n="321" who="S0390"><trunc>r</trunc>really I would never have known</u>
<u n="322" who="S0392" trans="overlap">where it does another twenty? <pause dur="short"/> where does the other twenty-five percent come from? well</u>

<u n="328" who="S0392" trans="overlap">drawing conclusions and <trunc>evalu</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> erm they give you the question</u>

<u n="330" who="S0392">and the first paper is where you plan an experiment and then they tell you what experiment to do <pause dur="short"/> and then you do it and then the <trunc>s</trunc> paper two is where you analyse the results and draw conclusion and things</u>
<u n="331" who="S0390">well what's the point of getting you to erm plan an experiment experiment and then giving you one?</u>

<u n="337" who="S0390">yeah</u>
<u n="338" who="S0392">sort of yeah but it's it's more question based so it'll say erm <pause dur="short"/> typical question might be what problems might you encounter and then there's a big <pause dur="short"/> twelve mark or whatever it is to say</u>
