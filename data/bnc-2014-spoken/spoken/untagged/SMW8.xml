<u n="417" who="S0316">I probably I want to get new ones but at the same time I'm not <trunc>ge</trunc> it's hard to break them in</u>
<u n="418" who="S0256">yeah oh god yeah I hate that part of everything</u>
<u n="419" who="S0316">so</u>
<u n="420" who="S0256">I just hate the fact that I'm not allowed to jump until they're broken in <pause dur="short"/> like until at least they've maybe settled <unclear/></u>
<u n="421" who="S0316">I wanna jump</u>
<u n="422" who="S0256"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="423" who="S0316">let me jump</u>
<u n="424" who="S0256">don't like it</u>
<u n="425" who="S0316">but my blades are so old now that they've pretty much been sharpened as far as they can go and</u>
<u n="426" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah the rock has like gone all and <trunc>na</trunc> mine are still quite new I need to take mine actually I need to take them to get them sharpened because I have got no edge well I have I have got an edge and anybody that <pause dur="short"/> doesn't normally skate would be fine with them but cos I'm <trunc>u</trunc> so used to having a sharp edge when it gets to that point and I'm like <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> well you go through like an edge and then you <trunc>a</trunc> start sliding like okay save it save it I've got to that point <unclear>I've left them</unclear> a little bit long and I need to get them sharpened but I keep forgetting <pause dur="short"/> I need to</u>
<u n="427" who="S0316" trans="overlap">you're still enjoying it then by the sounds of it?</u>
<u n="428" who="S0256">yeah love it I've got a lesson tomorrow morning so I might take them tomorrow night actually on my way home from work</u>
<u n="429" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="430" who="S0316">so what do you? erm so you have lessons for free or? dance or?</u>
<u n="431" who="S0256" trans="overlap">erm yeah free I tend to do erm I do a little bit of dance but not very often I prefer free <pause dur="short"/> the freestyle <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="432" who="S0316">cos I think if I went back now I'd probably do dancing which is another <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I'd</u>
<u n="433" who="S0256">yes</u>
<u n="434" who="S0316">so I can't decide whether to get dance skates or <pause dur="short"/> erm <unclear>faster</unclear> ones</u>
<u n="435" who="S0255" trans="overlap">so tell me what's the difference between free and dance?</u>
<u n="436" who="S0256">erm well freestyle is like all the jumps and the spins and all that sort of side of things</u>
<u n="437" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="438" who="S0256">whereas dance is the patterns and you do it to like <trunc>se</trunc> a set piece of music as a set pattern</u>
<u n="439" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="440" who="S0256">erm but there's now also free dance</u>
<u n="441" who="S0255">I'm now visualising line dancing I hope you realise which I know is not quite what you do</u>
<u n="442" who="S0256" trans="overlap"><unclear>which requires a</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> it's a bit like ballroom dancing</u>
<u n="443" who="S0316" trans="overlap">yeah it it you do it in partners generally</u>
<u n="444" who="S0255" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah okay and you're actually dancing on the <trunc>i</trunc>ice rather than</u>
<u n="445" who="S0256">careful</u>
<u n="446" who="S0255">it's alright these knives are so sharp</u>
<u n="447" who="S0256">yeah you're actually erm</u>
<u n="448" who="S0255">gosh that was very lucky</u>
<u n="449" who="S0256">you <trunc>a</trunc> it's like ballroom dancing</u>
<u n="450" who="S0255">that's probably not the best way to do it</u>
<u n="451" who="S0256" trans="overlap">on the ice in a sense because it's a set pattern and set steps that you do to this music</u>
<u n="452" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah okay <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="453" who="S0256">whereas freestyle you kind of when you get a programme for freestyle it's tailored made up really</u>
<u n="454" who="S0255">so and also so then the pairs so when you see the ice skating at the Olympics or something like that then the pair skating is when they're skating round but he's lifting and they're doing that's</u>
<u n="455" who="S0256">okay that's that's</u>
<u n="456" who="S0255">that's free</u>
<u n="457" who="S0256">that's paired <trunc>f</trunc> yeah that's paired free generally</u>
<u n="458" who="S0255" trans="overlap">oh yeah that's what I mean rather than dancing</u>
<u n="459" who="S0316" trans="overlap">although the dancers do do <unclear>kind of</unclear></u>
<u n="460" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="461" who="S0316">free interpretive styles so Torvill and Dean were dancers</u>
<u n="462" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="463" who="S0316">the pairs</u>
<u n="464" who="S0255" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="465" who="S0316">you can normally they're the women are very small and the men are very big and they literally are they chuck them</u>
<u n="466" who="S0255" trans="overlap"><unclear/> I watched them</u>
<u n="467" who="S0316">they spin so it's</u>
<u n="468" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="469" who="S0316">all about spins and jumps and</u>
<u n="470" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="471" who="S0255">which is like when they do the what's that famous Dancing on Ice? is it?</u>
<u n="472" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="473" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="474" who="S0256"><unclear>it's like that</unclear></u>
<u n="475" who="S0255">when they do that that is that sort of thing more that they're doing</u>
<u n="476" who="S0316" trans="overlap">yeah they go into that a bit more</u>
<u n="477" who="S0256" trans="overlap"><unclear>that's more</unclear></u>
<u n="478" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="479" who="S0316">it's kind of a combination between</u>
<u n="480" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="481" who="S0316">dance well <unclear/> is the lower level but they do do some pairs and <unclear/></u>
<u n="482" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="483" who="S0256" trans="overlap">there's yeah they started free dance now as well which is like a combination of dance and freestyle so if you don't necessarily wanna do freestyle and you don't necessarily wanna do dance cos it's patterned</u>
<u n="484" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="485" who="S0256">you can do free dance and it's basically you do a a number of jumps and spins</u>
<u n="486" who="S0255" trans="overlap">so you do dance <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="487" who="S0256">but it's more like you'll get like a jazz piece of music for example you'll do lots of twizzles and lots of</u>
<u n="488" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="489" who="S0256">footsteps and footwork and stuff so it's kind of in a way a combination</u>
<u n="490" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="491" who="S0256">so you're not doing that many jumps and spins and you're marked a lot on your footwork and steps <unclear/> and stuff</u>
<u n="492" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="493" who="S0256">and again the I mean the costumes are different so for like a free a freestyle thing you'd have quite a short skirt with the with the dress as a girl very glitzy very sparkly for the dance you tend to have longer dresses like not like ballroom length but they're they tend to be longer skirts and free dance as well longer skirts because it works better with the flowing and stuff and it it looks prettier in a way</u>
<u n="494" who="S0316">it's generally erm generally done by older people isn't it?</u>
<u n="495" who="S0256">I mean it can be yeah</u>
<u n="496" who="S0316" trans="overlap">but lots of people do do dance when they're younger</u>
<u n="497" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="498" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="499" who="S0256">but I mean we've got we've got a girl in my <unclear>class</unclear></u>
<u n="500" who="S0255" trans="overlap">you might do free and then go on to dance as they get older idea?</u>
<u n="501" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well we've actually got a girl at the minute who's probably about thirteen and she's starting out as a freestyler and now she's doing free dance and dance</u>
<u n="502" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="503" who="S0256">she's really talented at dance</u>
<u n="504" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="505" who="S0256">and erm it depends what you enjoy I mean if you don't like throwing yourself around and getting bashed and bruised and damaged cos you tend to do that a lot more in free than you would in dance cos dance <trunc>i</trunc>is generally if you catch a toe pick or catch your blade <unclear/> you will fall over but a lot of it's more about the the footwork and you're not really leaving the ice that much whereas obviously with free you're spending half the time in the air or spinning or you know that sort of thing so</u>
<u n="506" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="507" who="S0316">and dance blades are slightly different</u>
<u n="508" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="509" who="S0316">cos they have shorter backs because erm <pause dur="short"/> you do and you don't need as big so the and you don't need such big toe picks</u>
<u n="510" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="511" who="S0316">because toe picks obviously give you leverage for jumping</u>
<u n="512" who="S0255">like mushrooms?</u>
<u n="513" who="S0316">yeah I love mushrooms</u>
<u n="514" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="515" who="S0316">erm</u>
<u n="516" who="S0255">that's what I thought but I just wanted to check</u>
<u n="517" who="S0316">so your backs are smaller</u>
<u n="518" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="519" who="S0316">and your fronts are smaller</u>
<u n="520" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="521" who="S0256">mm <pause dur="short"/> my my blades at the minute are quite nice because the the back is quite short but it's not too short but it's rounded off <trunc>i</trunc> a lot more erm but my toe pick I've got a cross toe so that's like ideal for jumping so when you're a free skater you your blade is very much designed for jumping so you wanna have a toe pick that's gonna give you a lot of <trunc>c</trunc> er of height and and strength in your jumps</u>
<u n="522" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="523" who="S0256">course you don't need that as a dancer because generally you don't jump</u>
<u n="524" who="S0316" trans="overlap">they get in the way</u>
<u n="525" who="S0256">yeah and you can</u>
<u n="526" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="527" who="S0256">catch them very easy and go flying when you don't want to</u>
<u n="528" who="S0255" trans="overlap">so what are hockey skates like then?</u>
<u n="529" who="S0256">they're completely round they don't have a toe pick at all because they don't need to use a toe pick at all</u>
<u n="530" who="S0255" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="531" who="S0256">for any reason they're they're just</u>
<u n="532" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="533" who="S0316">they don't really have a back either</u>
<u n="534" who="S0256">no</u>
<u n="535" who="S0316">so it's literally like a <pause dur="short"/> erm you know one of those rolly herb blades?</u>
<u n="536" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="537" who="S0316">it's a bit like that</u>
<u n="538" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="539" who="S0316">like attached to the bottom of a</u>
<u n="540" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="541" who="S0316">oh skating one O one</u>
<u n="542" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="543" who="S0256"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="544" who="S0255">oh yeah it's it's interesting cos I know when you're explaining to me cos you do the test things you do which are the field moves and I was like uh</u>
<u n="545" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="546" who="S0255">now let me see if can remember field moves are actually like an isolated move that they're doing the actual technique that you're doing</u>
<u n="547" who="S0316">yeah</u>
<u n="548" who="S0255">and making sure you're doing that particular move right</u>
<u n="549" who="S0316">yeah</u>
<u n="550" who="S0255">so even though you do certain <trunc>thin</trunc> you're not doing a big routine for them</u>
<u n="551" who="S0256">no exactly</u>
<u n="552" who="S0255" trans="overlap">it's cos with routines</u>
<u n="553" who="S0316" trans="overlap">although they are linked</u>
<u n="554" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="555" who="S0255">like with routines you get marked on the like your skate ability don't you as well?</u>
<u n="556" who="UNKFEMALE" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="557" who="S0255">and you as well as the actual things they are linked okay huh</u>
<u n="558" who="S0316">so for a field moves test you would have a set of maybe I don't know how many it is</u>
<u n="559" who="S0256">four there's four moves in a set generally</u>
<u n="560" who="S0316">and then there's a few sets isn't there? so you would set off</u>
<u n="561" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="562" who="S0316">around the ice and then generally you'd go down each side <trunc>w</trunc> that's right isn't it?</u>
<u n="563" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yes yeah <unclear>mm</unclear></u>
<u n="564" who="S0316" trans="overlap">so erm outside edges might be one of them</u>
<u n="565" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="566" who="S0316">so you have to do</u>
<u n="567" who="S0256" trans="overlap">which is what I'm doing at the minute</u>
<u n="568" who="S0316">what is it?</u>
<u n="569" who="S0256">back out and in I'm doing so yeah well you wanna put four or five in</u>
<u n="570" who="S0316" trans="overlap">four</u>
<u n="571" who="S0256">no more than five they don't like well they don't want any less than four <vocal desc="laugh"/> so four or five</u>
<u n="572" who="S0316">it's really precise so you kind of know what pattern you're gonna make on the ice</u>
<u n="573" who="S0255">yeah right</u>
<u n="574" who="S0316">when you're learning them I don't know if they do the same here but they used to <trunc>s</trunc> etch them out on the ice floor</u>
<u n="575" who="S0256" trans="overlap">they they do sometimes yeah</u>
<u n="576" who="S0316" trans="overlap"><trunc>fo</trunc> just <trunc>fo</trunc> learn to follow it</u>
<u n="577" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="578" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="579" who="S0316">erm <pause dur="short"/> so you'll set off</u>
<u n="580" who="S0256" trans="overlap"><unclear>with their magic pens</unclear></u>
<u n="581" who="S0316">and you'll know what the next move is that you're gonna have to display</u>
<u n="582" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="583" who="S0316">so you'll go round and do a length of four and then you'll maybe do a different move down the inside?</u>
<u n="584" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah so for example my first one now that I'm doing in my level two I do back outside edges down one side</u>
<u n="585" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="586" who="S0256">and then back inside edges down the other</u>
<u n="587" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="588" who="S0256">and you have to make it equal so if you do five on one side you gotta do five on the other if you do more on one side than the other you'll you'll lose points for it</u>
<u n="589" who="S0255">right so it's it's very precise that you've gotta do this and this in a certain way in a certain time in a certain space</u>
<u n="590" who="S0256" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="591" who="S0316" trans="overlap">it's a certain length it's a certain distance</u>
<u n="592" who="S0256" trans="overlap">and I've got erm</u>
<u n="593" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="594" who="S0256">I've got a figure of eight one as well because you'll often have a figure of eight one you normally have it'll be one or two sometimes three mine are about three of edge ones like down down the sides of the rink and then you'll often have at least one figure of eight one so my figure of eight is my three turns my inside three turns and my outside three turns in a figure of eight and it has to be again five and five so if I do five outside three turns one side five the inside the other</u>
<u n="595" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="596" who="S0256">it's just it's just kind of displaying the skating basics at each level so to show that yes you can do tricks and yes you can do this and yes you can do that but you can do skating basics as well</u>
<u n="597" who="S0255">okay</u>
<u n="598" who="S0256">and I'm looking forward to level three level three oh I'm really not actually <vocal desc="laugh"/> I've got a two <unclear>slot</unclear> <trunc>s</trunc> a spirally one where you go from an outside edge to an inside edge which is not fun kind of end up swimming but it doesn't quite turn and I've gotta do back <pause dur="short"/> and forward like inside and outside three turns which I don't really like either <pause dur="short"/> so I'm not looking forward to that one so much <vocal desc="laugh"/> but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s getting us working on it now already cos obviously by the time I pass my two I need to be working on my three so that I can get ready to start putting it in once it's ready <vocal desc="sigh"/> so <pause dur="short"/> mm beer and then I've got my tests for my elements level one soon as well gotta redo that</u>
<u n="599" who="S0316">very good</u>
<u n="600" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="601" who="S0255">but the elements one wasn't that the one where <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="602" who="S0256">got confused about the groups</u>
<u n="603" who="S0255" trans="overlap">got confused about what you had to do? so actually <unclear/></u>
<u n="604" who="S0256" trans="overlap">she's still <unclear>right</unclear> a relatively new coach erm</u>
<u n="605" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="606" who="S0256">and she got muddled up into another <unclear/> she was she absolutely devastated that she'd done it</u>
<u n="607" who="S0255" trans="overlap">she was so upset wasn't she but?</u>
<u n="608" who="S0256">because I spent months and months working on my Salchow to do a free jump and a Salchow months and I didn't do one toe loop and then on the day I did the <trunc>s</trunc> free jump and then did the Salchow and the judge called me over and went it's very nice you've given me both the first options but you need to do a toe loop and I'm like sorry? she's like you have to do a toe loop on this one so then I did it and because I hadn't done them for months it just didn't work at all</u>
<u n="609" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="610" who="S0256">because she'd she'd got muddled up between level one and level two cos level two it's the free jump or the <trunc>salc</trunc> or <trunc>c</trunc> er free jump no you have to do a Salchow I think as er something like that and you can pick between a a a <trunc>t</trunc> a toe loop and a Salchow but yeah it's erm so she got muddled up and</u>
<u n="611" who="S0255">ah</u>
<u n="612" who="S0256">she's paid for me to do my redo my test though so I didn't have to pay for it</u>
<u n="613" who="S0316">yeah</u>
<u n="614" who="S0256">cos she felt really bad but</u>
<u n="615" who="S0316">cool</u>
<u n="616" who="S0256">yeah yeah bless her</u>
<u n="617" who="S0255">she's lovely isn't she <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="618" who="S0256">she is</u>
<u n="619" who="S0255">yep</u>
<u n="620" who="S0316">very good</u>

<u n="622" who="S0256"><vocal desc="laugh"/> have you enjoyed your skating class <unclear>mum</unclear>?</u>
<u n="623" who="S0255">yeah well the thing is</u>
<u n="624" who="S0256"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="625" who="S0255">I mean the I'm already <trunc>interest</trunc> cos you always come back and tell me anyway and explain things and show things and it's quite good you've got a nice slidey floor so she can sort of do</u>
<u n="626" who="S0316">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="627" who="S0256">do the skating on the floor</u>
<u n="628" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah I did yeah I did that that and then I'm doing the you know so I get all of that and she plays the music she's gonna do <trunc>f</trunc> things for routines so but when she starts the inside edge the outside <trunc>e</trunc> you know although I'm listening it just goes a little bit <event desc="sound of whistling over the head"/></u>
<u n="629" who="S0256">yeah</u>
<u n="630" who="S0255" trans="overlap">and so and yeah so it's quite nice actually that she's when she's talking I know at skating you can talk to people but it's quite nice to talk and you understand and</u>
<u n="631" who="S0316">mm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="632" who="S0255">yeah so do you think you're gonna get some skates and go back and?</u>

<u n="634" who="S0255">you've been saying about it for a couple of years or so haven't you?</u>
<u n="635" who="S0316" trans="overlap">I don't <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I'd ever go back and do any</u>

<u n="1113" who="S0256"><unclear>we</unclear> we can look at it at some point</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0255">mm certainly</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0256">erm I've spoken to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> already and she says like what the what's best to do is to focus on what you've done in this job not like in any other jobs</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0255">right</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0256">because it's like an internal expression of interest</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0256"><vocal desc="cough"/> you know they wanna know what you've done in this role to make you think you're qualified which is apparently there's <trunc>m</trunc> there is gonna be probably more than one role because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s already got a role because she's meant to be doing an EO job and then they've really mucked her around</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0255" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0256">and said oh well you're not trained oh no actually it's because you've got so many weeks booked off holiday in December and they can't make up their mind what the reason is but now all of a sudden she's not allowed to go and do this EO job</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0255">mm</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0256">so she's now being trained to be a dep so that when another EO position comes up she will be trained already pretty much</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0255" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0256">to be an EO and she'll have a bit of experience of it anyway but then also erm you know she's first on the list basically if an EO role comes available but she'll be given preference for it</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0255">what does she think about being trained to be a dep?</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0256">she's not very happy she says</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0255" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0256">she feels like it's a consolation prize cos she's been</u>

<u n="1132" who="S0255">well it'll be different money won't it?</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0256" trans="overlap"><unclear>and what they're actually doing is fobbing her off</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> it is a bit more than a dep but not a lot</u>

<u n="1214" who="S0256" trans="overlap">exactly that's the main point</u>

<u n="4031" who="S0255" trans="overlap">toast or bread yeah yeah so so she'll have that every two weeks she basically uses a whole jar of this stuff erm so I said to mum right leave it with me I'll so I got in touch with the Co-op erm or the people that made it for the Co-op and tracked back to that and then <trunc>fou</trunc> got them to send me the list of ingredients cos I said to mum if I can find what's in it I can then get in touch with other people that make marmalade find one that's got the same things in it and then she can have that you know so this took me literally about three months</u>
<u n="4032" who="S0316"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="4033" who="S0255">it's by the time they got somebody who was gonna do it from the archives and then they were gonna send it and then they were gonna do <trunc>th</trunc> and then I got it and then the people <trunc>s</trunc> worked at <anon type="place"/> <unclear>now it's cos</unclear> wasn't them cos it used to be <anon type="place"/> you know it went on and you know that sort of thing</u>
<u n="4034" who="S0316" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="4035" who="S0255">in the end I managed to get hold of a company and found and it's the the <anon type="place"/> the ones that we supply anyway erm yes they do this little fine cut lemon marmalade and yes it's got this and it's actually got less ingredients in than the one she was having so we knew that would be fine so I organised it made it yeah can they send it? don't put anything in it with any price cos you know it's about four pound delivery which she would've fallen off her chair with never mind anything else send it to her and then I said to mum tell her this is coming and if it's any good I'll then organise and get you know box of twelve or something yeah</u>
<u n="4036" who="S0316" trans="overlap">crates of it yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="4040" who="S0316">mm</u>
<u n="4041" who="S0255">but actually and this is what I was gonna say is she if if I have something's gonna be delivered one of them's gonna have to stay awake at at all time but to stay awake in the day at some at every point just in case it comes to hear the door so they can't both go and have a sleep for a while and I was like oh bless <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="4049" who="S0255">yeah</u>
<u n="4050" who="S0316">it's strange isn't it? cos you don't ever see yourself getting to that</u>
<u n="4051" who="S0255">no</u>
<u n="4052" who="S0316">stage but</u>
<u n="4053" who="S0255">no</u>
<u n="4054" who="S0316">is it cos so much changes do you think by the time that you're older or?</u>

<u n="4071" who="S0256">whereas when you're elderly you've got time to think about what it could do</u>

<u n="4076" who="S0256" trans="overlap"><unclear/> would not be bothered</u>
<u n="4077" who="S0255" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I think as you as you get older as even like now for me I can tell the last few years what my joints and my wrists in the winter I'm getting pains in my wrists and into my fingers and it just <trunc>com</trunc> just like now this last weekend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s suddenly gone oh everything my rheumatism whatever and I'm thinking yeah and all my here and here so things like that start changing you you know yeah you get the classic you can't go out two nights on the trot or else you'll really struggle <trunc>w</trunc> that sort of thing so <trunc>the</trunc>there's stuff like that but there's also stuff that you suddenly find you're not so confident doing because things have changed and things have moved on and actually <trunc>u</trunc> you know <trunc>s</trunc> it's</u>
