<u n="1" who="S0018">okay <pause dur="short"/> so what is it that you do here in the magistrate court?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0074">okay <pause dur="short"/> I am a part-time court usher <pause dur="short"/> which basically means er I work twenty hours a week um Monday Wednesday and Thursday</u>
<u n="3" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="4" who="S0074">and the role of an usher is really about keeping the court moving</u>
<u n="5" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="6" who="S0074">so I try and establish what cases are in during the course of the day and liaise with the legal adviser</u>
<u n="7" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="8" who="S0074">and also the er CPS lawyer</u>
<u n="9" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="10" who="S0074">and just see that our lists er all match <pause dur="short"/> and then I make sure that everybody's paperwork is the same <pause dur="short"/> and then I try and find out if any of the offenders are here</u>
<u n="11" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="12" who="S0074">and if they are are they represented by a solicitor <pause dur="short"/> er er whether they want to see the duty solicitor <pause dur="short"/> which is a free service</u>
<u n="13" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="14" who="S0074">that they can have <pause dur="short"/> and er you know if it's a youth have they got a parent with them? Er are they known to the youth offending team? That sort of thing</u>
<u n="15" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="16" who="S0074">and basically it's just about keeping the court moving</u>
<u n="17" who="S0018">right <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="18" who="S0074">er</u>
<u n="19" who="S0018">it sounds like a lot of responsibilities</u>
<u n="20" who="S0074">well not really</u>
<u n="21" who="S0018">in one <pause dur="short"/> no?</u>
<u n="22" who="S0074">not really <pause dur="short"/> it's er I suppose it yes it sounds that way <pause dur="short"/> but er it is really about knowing your way round the court</u>
<u n="23" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="24" who="S0074">and er just as I said making sure that er everybody's in the right place at the right time</u>
<u n="25" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0074">er and maybe just you know sort of trying to make sure that the paperwork is perhaps collected from wherever</u>
<u n="27" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="28" who="S0074">just so that er it keeps going rather than end up having stop start situations</u>
<u n="29" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="30" who="S0074">Cos nobody really likes that</u>
<u n="31" who="S0018">Cos that saves saves er everyone time and</u>
<u n="32" who="S0074">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0018">saves on stress for you <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="34" who="S0074">well I think it's the magistrates more than anybody else</u>
<u n="35" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="36" who="S0074">Cos they er well they're volunteers</u>
<u n="37" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0074">and they want to try and keep it fluid</u>
<u n="39" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0074">and er so really that's what it's all about</u>
<u n="41" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="42" who="S0074">um <pause dur="short"/> but it's I mean it's quite interesting</u>
<u n="43" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="44" who="S0074">meet all sorts of different people <pause dur="short"/> today we've had um tut er a group of four who er had committed a burglary <pause dur="short"/> and one had er driven very dangerously <pause dur="short"/> and er they got lots of supporters here like</u>
<u n="45" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="46" who="S0074">parents and girlfriends and  and er  er fellow er offenders <pause dur="short"/> and they were very vocal</u>
<u n="47" who="S0018">oh dear</u>
<u n="48" who="S0074">so er but yeah that's what makes it quite interesting really</u>
<u n="49" who="S0018">er but er did you feel at risk or threatened?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0074">no</u>
<u n="51" who="S0018">no?</u>
<u n="52" who="S0074">er I um</u>
<u n="53" who="S0018">no</u>
<u n="54" who="S0074">tut no because you're in a quite social environment anyway</u>
<u n="55" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0074">and I think as long as you try and just speak to people <pause dur="short"/> I think you know if you try and explain</u>
<u n="57" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="58" who="S0074">that really it's not gonna help if they start er being vocal</u>
<u n="59" who="S0018">right <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0074">and making contact with people in custody <pause dur="short"/> that sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> so that's <unclear/></u>
<u n="61" who="S0018">were they  were they  being vocal in a</u>
<u n="62" who="S0074">er <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="63" who="S0018">aggressive way? Or just er?</u>
<u n="64" who="S0074">yes <pause dur="short"/> because they're not getting their own way</u>
<u n="65" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="66" who="S0074">so I think that's really what it's all about</u>
<u n="67" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="68" who="S0074">so</u>
<u n="69" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="70" who="S0074">so yeah <pause dur="short"/> so basically that's er roughly er it</u>
<u n="71" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0074">and it and I mean it can be quite physical really <pause dur="short"/> as <trunc>y</trunc></u>
<u n="73" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="74" who="S0074">as you your mum'll probably tell you <pause dur="short"/> er cos you're sort of up and down stairs with um sort of paperwork and <trunc>mak</trunc></u>
<u n="75" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0074">er making sure again that sort of things like warrants or er um files are</u>
<u n="77" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0074">with the right sort of people <pause dur="short"/> so it saves you having a workout</u>
<u n="79" who="S0018">aha</u>
<u n="80" who="S0074">because you're up and down the stairs every time <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="81" who="S0018">there you go <pause dur="short"/> and you save money on the gym <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="82" who="S0074">that's right <pause dur="short"/> so that's quite nice really <pause dur="short"/> so so yeah <pause dur="short"/> so there you go <pause dur="short"/> so yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0018">and you said that some the magistrates are volunteers?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0074">they're all volunteers</u>
<u n="85" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="86" who="S0074">yeah</u>
<u n="87" who="S0018">er <trunc>d</trunc> does that always happen at a local</u>
<u n="88" who="S0074">yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0018">justice level?</u>
<u n="90" who="S0074">yeah <pause dur="short"/> in <trunc>ma</trunc> in magistrates court</u>
<u n="91" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0074">they're all volunteers <pause dur="short"/> er they go through an interview process <pause dur="short"/> er I think that's quite rigid actually <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and they er then have to do so many hours</u>
<u n="93" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="94" who="S0074">and er er they some of them are trained to deal with youth matters or family matters</u>
<u n="95" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0074">and er then er er I suppose they have a little bit of training in the law <pause dur="short"/> so that they've got some basic skills</u>
<u n="97" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="98" who="S0074">but the idea is that er the legal adviser who sits sort of below the magistrates</u>
<u n="99" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="100" who="S0074">er they're trained legally <pause dur="short"/> they're solicitors basically</u>
<u n="101" who="S0018">right <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0074">so the magistrates'll go out and make a decision <pause dur="short"/> er and then they'll call for the legal adviser to go in <pause dur="short"/> and she or he will just give them advice to say yes that's within the law or</u>
<u n="103" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="104" who="S0074">mm mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="106" who="S0074">can't do that</u>
<u n="107" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="108" who="S0074">er and then just yeah sort of give them some advice</u>
<u n="109" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="110" who="S0074">and er really the legal adviser's the person that runs the court</u>
<u n="111" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="112" who="S0074">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>sh</trunc> he or she obviously has the knowledge and</u>
<u n="113" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0074">and advises them <pause dur="short"/> but you know fair play to them <pause dur="short"/> they come in and</u>
<u n="115" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0074">they give their own time</u>
<u n="117" who="S0018">definitely</u>
<u n="118" who="S0074">um</u>
<u n="119" who="S0018">how how often do they usually come in?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0074">well I'm not sure how many hours they have to do</u>
<u n="121" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0074">but I <trunc>s</trunc> I know certainly they have to do so so many <pause dur="short"/> because I know because we haven't got much work at the moment they're</u>
<u n="123" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="124" who="S0074">really sort of anxious that they get their hours in</u>
<u n="125" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="126" who="S0074">tut <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so yeah that's</u>
<u n="127" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="128" who="S0074">er that's what they do <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="129" who="S0018">ah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0074">as I say fair play to them</u>
<u n="131" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0074">and they  and they  come from all <trunc>s</trunc> sort of backgrounds</u>
<u n="133" who="S0018">definitely <pause dur="short"/> well my old chemistry teacher is a magistrate here</u>
<u n="134" who="S0074">aha</u>
<u n="135" who="S0018">er</u>
<u n="136" who="S0074">so yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="138" who="S0074">well I think that's good then</u>
<u n="139" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="140" who="S0074">because you know you've got an idea of the issues in schools</u>
<u n="141" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="142" who="S0074">and that sort of thing</u>
<u n="143" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="144" who="S0074">er and I think <trunc>n</trunc> perhaps a background in social care</u>
<u n="145" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0074">that sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> or I <trunc>w</trunc> as I say teaching or maybe health</u>
<u n="147" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0074">er because some of the issues that some of these folks have</u>
<u n="149" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="150" who="S0074">er and the reasons why they're here</u>
<u n="151" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="152" who="S0074">you know <pause dur="short"/> they're</u>
<u n="153" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0074">perhaps involved with drugs or they've got family issues <pause dur="short"/> that sort of thing</u>
<u n="155" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0074">so it's I I think it's good to have er a bit of an understanding</u>
<u n="157" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="158" who="S0074">you know</u>
<u n="159" who="S0018">definitely</u>
<u n="160" who="S0074">of er about why they're here and what's open to them</u>
<u n="161" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="162" who="S0074">and they can advise them you know obviously <pause dur="short"/> they use probation a lot as well</u>
<u n="163" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="164" who="S0074">um <pause dur="short"/> who if if the magistrates feel they need to know a little bit more about that person</u>
<u n="165" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0074">to see whether they're suitable for er probation er report</u>
<u n="167" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="168" who="S0074">having some guidance maybe on drugs or um any other abuse</u>
<u n="169" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0074">er or if it's er an assault <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> maybe they need to look at their anger management <pause dur="short"/> that sort of thing</u>
<u n="171" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="172" who="S0074">um <pause dur="short"/> they will then er give them that er guidance <pause dur="short"/> and the magistrates will then look at them and say yes okay this person could do that <pause dur="short"/> if they've got sort of medical needs then er they're perhaps not suitable for doing work</u>
<u n="173" who="S0018">mm mhm</u>
<u n="174" who="S0074">er or like I had a guy today who'd got a drink issue <pause dur="short"/> and er they said he wasn't suitable for doing work</u>
<u n="175" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="176" who="S0074">Cos I suppose if he comes along and he's had a few few jars</u>
<u n="177" who="S0018">yes <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="178" who="S0074">then it wouldn't be suitable <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="179" who="S0018">oh is that like community service</u>
<u n="180" who="S0074">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0018">work?</u>

<u n="184" who="S0074">yeah er yeah</u>
<u n="185" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="186" who="S0074">so he if he was I don't know perhaps working in a shop or er you know he's er in close contact with a number of other people</u>
<u n="187" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0074">then it's not fair is it if he's</u>
<u n="189" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="190" who="S0074">had a few to drink</u>
<u n="191" who="S0018">no</u>
<u n="192" who="S0074">so that is er</u>
<u n="193" who="S0018">so all the people like that usually get fined? Or?</u>
<u n="194" who="S0074">they sometimes they get fined <pause dur="short"/> er in this case his case was er what had happened to him? I think he was given a suspended sentence</u>
<u n="195" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="196" who="S0074">because he'd got something else as well</u>
<u n="197" who="S0018">oh</u>

<u n="199" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="200" who="S0074">decided that a suspended sentence <pause dur="short"/> whether that will stop him from reoffending</u>

<u n="433" who="S0074">no <pause dur="short"/> no? Maybe good cos you might just fall out couldn't you yeah</u>
<u n="434" who="S0018">but um</u>
<u n="435" who="S0074"><unclear/></u>
<u n="436" who="S0018">I think it costs quite a lot of money to insure</u>
<u n="437" who="S0074">insure you as well</u>
<u n="438" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="439" who="S0074">in fact I was talking to er a girl the other day <pause dur="short"/> she's seventeen in September</u>
<u n="440" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="441" who="S0074">and er um my <trunc>d</trunc> er my dad's car was was being sold and I thought oh a little Corsa that might be quite nice for her</u>
<u n="442" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="443" who="S0074">and er so we we talked about you know was it worth her having it and keeping it till September when she'd <trunc>l</trunc> started to learn to drive <pause dur="short"/> and er her insurance was going to be three thousand</u>
<u n="444" who="S0018">huh</u>
<u n="445" who="S0074">three hundred pounds</u>
<u n="446" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="447" who="S0074">can you imagine? And she's <trunc>g</trunc> she's got some work <pause dur="short"/> she works in a hairdressers</u>
<u n="448" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="449" who="S0074">er and she's going to college in Stratford in September</u>
<u n="450" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="451" who="S0074">but er you know if you think like she obviously likes her clothes <pause dur="short"/> she's only young <pause dur="short"/> likes her clothes <pause dur="short"/> likes going to concerts and things <pause dur="short"/> really she'll have the added responsibility of A paying three thousand three hundred</u>
<u n="452" who="S0018">fff <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="453" who="S0074">and then having to run a car</u>
<u n="454" who="S0018">mhm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="455" who="S0074">you know <pause dur="short"/> put petrol in and everything <pause dur="short"/> so it was a joint decision</u>
<u n="456" who="S0018">do they do that to tut to kind of put people off?</u>
<u n="457" who="S0074">well <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>apparen</trunc></u>
<u n="458" who="S0018">put youngsters off buying cars?</u>
<u n="459" who="S0074">mhm well by all accounts had she have been male it would've been even more</u>
<u n="460" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="461" who="S0074">so they obviously regard young male drivers as more of a risk than female</u>
<u n="462" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="463" who="S0074">which I don't know whether they can do that now <pause dur="short"/> cos there was some law wasn't there</u>
<u n="464" who="S0018">that's right <pause dur="short"/> there was mm</u>
<u n="465" who="S0074">coming out about er insurance <pause dur="short"/> it's gotta be equal rights and all that sort of stuff</u>
<u n="466" who="S0018">so it's probably gone up even more for girls</u>
<u n="467" who="S0074">quite <pause dur="short"/> but er yes <pause dur="short"/> three thousand three hundred</u>
<u n="468" who="S0018">oh that's awful</u>
<u n="469" who="S0074">and and if her parents had put her on their insurance</u>
<u n="470" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="471" who="S0074">I mean they sort of say well really that's just not the way forward because she never going to get her no claims</u>
<u n="472" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="473" who="S0074">and I think er you know insurance companies now recognize that that's what people are doing</u>
<u n="474" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="475" who="S0074">and so I think they're just sort of putting</u>
<u n="476" who="S0018">putting an end to it</u>
<u n="477" who="S0074"><unclear/> mm</u>
<u n="478" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="479" who="S0074">but I I just thought gosh</u>
<u n="480" who="S0018">that is a lot isn't it</u>

<u n="492" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="493" who="S0074">so that's why they <trunc>decide</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> and as I say she decided that this wasn't right for her <pause dur="short"/> she would leave it you know a little while and</u>
<u n="494" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="495" who="S0074">see how it goes <pause dur="short"/> so that's what she's going to do</u>

<u n="1325" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0018">and they er the whole attitude well at least in the schools that I saw was that we're here for a social experience</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0018">we're here to enjoy each other's company <pause dur="short"/> and we're here to gossip about what people have written on Facebook <pause dur="short"/> and oh what do you mean can I have a look at exercise three?

<u n="1329" who="S0074">huh</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0018">it's like <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> That just encourage you know not enforcing any rules and</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0074"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1332" who="S0018">letting them go in looking like</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0074">mm <pause dur="short"/> going for a night out</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0074">never mind going to <trunc>r</trunc> to school</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0018">no</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0074">to learn</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0018">exactly <pause dur="short"/> that's that's what the thing is though</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0074">no <pause dur="short"/> it's not good is it</u>
<u n="1340" who="S0018">and er obviously if you're a primary teacher you can control your own rules on a daily basis</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0074">yes</u>
<u n="1342" who="S0018">but when you're a secondary teacher and these kids are going to about eight you know</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1344" who="S0018">six seven different lessons every day with different people</u>
<u n="1345" who="S0074">tut</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0018">if that's not maintained</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0074">different standards</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0074">as well</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0018">if that's not maintained</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0074">tut <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0018">across all those six then</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0074">yeah</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0018">that can be really detrimental to their</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0074">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> very very hard</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0074">I I fff I I I can understand where you're coming from</u>
<u n="1358" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0074">for sure <pause dur="short"/> I just think it is very very hard <pause dur="short"/> I mean I as I say I just do a little bit with er seven-year-olds</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> really?</u>
<u n="1361" who="S0074">and um tut er you know the <unclear/></u>
<u n="1362" who="S0018">is it a local school?</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0074">yes <pause dur="short"/> in er in Hampton</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0074">and er I just do an afternoon <pause dur="short"/> and I just really you know do a little bit of reading or</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0074">help out with science or whatever they're doing really <pause dur="short"/> I</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0018">oh <pause dur="short"/> super</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0074">whatever <pause dur="short"/> and you know sometimes there are some in those classes that are really quite disruptive</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0074">and I suppose the advantages of having er another person in the class is that you can perhaps work with those disruptive ones</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0074">so that the rest of the class can get on with the business</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0074">and they are fairly receptive <pause dur="short"/> okay if they're not then as you say you've got a fallback in as much as they can go and see the head or the deputy or whatever <pause dur="short"/> or they lose some of their playtime <pause dur="short"/> whatever</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0074">but I think with older ones it's real hard isn't it</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0018">it is <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0074">to enforce and er huh I just think it's in some ways unless you have got it from the very top and it it</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0074">it it's fed down and everybody's singing from the same hymn sheet</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> definitely</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0074">it's really really tough isn't it</u>
<u n="1384" who="S0018">and I think schools need to be a bit smaller as well</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0074">tut <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0018">to make them feel that everybody knows them</u>
<u n="1387" who="S0074">that's right</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0018">that they are treated as an individual</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0074">yes</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0018">as opposed to you boy in the corridor and</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0074">yeah er yeah yeah yeah I think that's</u>
<u n="1392" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0074">absolutely right <pause dur="short"/> somebody cares</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0018"><trunc>S</trunc> er class sizes need to be a bit smaller</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0074">yeah</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0018">and I think yeah no I think it needs to be all <trunc>rehau</trunc> overhauled from</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0074">the whole thing</u>
<u n="1398" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0074">yeah</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0018">the whole system</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0074">I mean they do keep tweaking it <pause dur="short"/> but it's er it's</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0074"><trunc>un</trunc> er <trunc>un</trunc> they do say about class sizes don't they</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0074">that they shouldn't be over thirty is it?</u>
<u n="1406" who="S0018">but they get they're only going to get bigger now</u>
<u n="1407" who="S0074">I think so <pause dur="short"/> because we are having more children aren't we</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0074">and</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="1411" who="S0074">er I mean er huh it I just don't know how it's gonna resolve itself <pause dur="short"/> I er it's</u>
<u n="1412" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1413" who="S0074">quite concerning really isn't it</u>
<u n="1414" who="S0018">it is <pause dur="short"/> especially now the government's turned education <trunc>ba</trunc></u>
<u n="1415" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0018">basically they've</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0074"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1418" who="S0018">basically privatized it</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0074">that's it <pause dur="short"/> yep <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and er and of course there is that theory that you know like academies that that you know they're they're paid more aren't they</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0074">if they er are an academy and I suppose that's an incentive for people to go into those sort of environments</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0018">yes</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0074">and are they the right people?</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0018">well er yes</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0018">tut <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I can see how maybe initially there might be er a drive for quality and standards er</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0018">but it's gonna depend on the personalities of the senior leaders</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0074">tut <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0018">as you said er you know if they're going into it for profit you should be questioning their motives to go for going into it</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0074">huh</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0018">but also it's going to be even more target-driven and</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0074">yes</u>
<u n="1434" who="S0018">achievement-led <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="1435" who="S0074">because it's about league tables isn't it</u>
<u n="1436" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1437" who="S0074">really <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="1438" who="S0018">and I er <trunc>w</trunc> what I saw  I saw  fiddling going on</u>
<u n="1439" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1440" who="S0018">just so that they could make their targets</u>
<u n="1441" who="S0074">yeah</u>
<u n="1442" who="S0018">um tut I think in in a situation where er it's gonna get more fierce in that they're not gonna get their funding unless they do meet those targets</u>
<u n="1443" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1444" who="S0018">what's gonna happen well <trunc>y</trunc> you're gonna see a lot of good results but what is actually the reality behind the</u>
<u n="1445" who="S0074">exactly</u>
<u n="1446" who="S0018">educational experience</u>
<u n="1447" who="S0074">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah er</u>
<u n="1448" who="S0018">and then you've got the worry of okay well you know parents who can afford to get their kids into certain schools</u>
<u n="1449" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1450" who="S0018">tut will you know huh</u>
<u n="1451" who="S0074">tut <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1452" who="S0018">parents who don't really care about their kids or don't invest time</u>
<u n="1453" who="S0074">no</u>
<u n="1454" who="S0018">and preparation in their</u>
<u n="1455" who="S0074">well you you do</u>
<u n="1456" who="S0018">it's just</u>
<u n="1457" who="S0074">er you see it don't you <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and hear about some children I mean they don't er can't even read and write</u>
<u n="1458" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1459" who="S0074">can they</u>
<u n="1460" who="S0018">that's just</u>
<u n="1461" who="S0074">never mind the other basic skills</u>
<u n="1462" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1463" who="S0074">that are needed in life and I just yeah find it</u>
<u n="1464" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1465" who="S0074">really quite sad isn't it</u>
<u n="1466" who="S0018">it is</u>
<u n="1467" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1468" who="S0018">it's horrendous</u>
<u n="1469" who="S0074">Cos er some of our customers are a bit like that <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="1470" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1471" who="S0074">you know you er kind of take it all for granted don't you</u>
<u n="1472" who="S0018">tut</u>
<u n="1473" who="S0074">the reading aspect of it <pause dur="short"/> and you know like we</u>
<u n="1474" who="S0018">definitely</u>
<u n="1475" who="S0074">have to take an oath and I've <trunc>g</trunc> I've had situations where people really struggle <pause dur="short"/> so I you change your working practice</u>
<u n="1476" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1477" who="S0074">so that you actually do read it out and <trunc>l</trunc> and they follow you</u>
<u n="1478" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="1479" who="S0074">er and it's interesting just how many</u>
<u n="1480" who="S0018"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1481" who="S0074">you know really just can't manage it <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="1482" who="S0018">gosh</u>
<u n="1483" who="S0074">that's just another example of you know your own experience of of</u>
<u n="1484" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1485" who="S0074">how people just aren't able to</u>
<u n="1486" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1487" who="S0074">deal with the basic stuff</u>
<u n="1488" who="S0018">and if these people are having children that</u>
<u n="1489" who="S0074">well absolutely <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="1490" who="S0018">are now populating the schools <pause dur="short"/> how?</u>
<u n="1491" who="S0074">and if er they can't help them can they with homework</u>
<u n="1492" who="S0018">no</u>
<u n="1493" who="S0074">or encourage them in any way if they don't know how to do it themselves</u>
<u n="1494" who="S0018">and how can a teacher who's got thirty kids er plus</u>
<u n="1495" who="S0074">exactly</u>
<u n="1496" who="S0018">under their <unclear/></u>
<u n="1497" who="S0074">start to to try and do those</u>
<u n="1498" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="1499" who="S0074">because er as you say er a teaching assistant costs a lot</u>
<u n="1500" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1501" who="S0074">er or you know special needs er again they're having to look at that aren't they because</u>
<u n="1502" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1503" who="S0074">it's all er costing isn't it</u>
<u n="1504" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1505" who="S0074">so yeah I er I I just don't know <pause dur="short"/> I I don't agree with this performance culture in</u>
<u n="1506" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1507" who="S0074">in er  in er in the  the health or in the police or in courts or</u>
<u n="1508" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1509" who="S0074">schools at all</u>
<u n="1510" who="S0018">no</u>
<u n="1511" who="S0074">because I I do think as you rightly say that the it's manipulated isn't it</u>
<u n="1512" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="1513" who="S0074">to accommodate er the finance of it if you like</u>
<u n="1514" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and it gives a very small spectrum</u>
<u n="1515" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1516" who="S0018">of what people can achieve <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> of what types of things people can achieve</u>
<u n="1517" who="S0074">that's right</u>
<u n="1518" who="S0018">because for some kids you know they're not academically minded</u>
<u n="1519" who="S0074">no</u>
<u n="1520" who="S0018">that doesn't necessarily mean that they won't just won't be as successful in life</u>
<u n="1521" who="S0074">and thrive in another way</u>
<u n="1522" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1523" who="S0074">Cos they're perhaps practical aren't they</u>
<u n="1524" who="S0018"><vocal desc="cough"/> Exactly</u>
<u n="1525" who="S0074">and I  and I  think before we were in this er culture of performance that that was identified more wasn't it</u>
<u n="1526" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1527" who="S0074">you know <pause dur="short"/> and  and that  that er you were able to encourage somebody in a  in a a  practical way if you know if they were good at carpentry or</u>
<u n="1528" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1529" who="S0074">you know gardening or whatever</u>
<u n="1530" who="S0018">definitely</u>
<u n="1531" who="S0074">it might be <pause dur="short"/> um and that er or PE er actually</u>
<u n="1532" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1533" who="S0074">you know <pause dur="short"/> I mean there are  there are  some people who are not academic but they're really good sports people <pause dur="short"/> and I think you need to encourage and and really sort of embrace those sort of</u>
<u n="1534" who="S0018">definitely</u>
<u n="1535" who="S0074">people don't you</u>
<u n="1536" who="S0018">and maybe even give them an avenue to develop that from</u>
<u n="1537" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1538" who="S0018">a very early age</u>
<u n="1539" who="S0074">absolutely</u>
<u n="1540" who="S0018">as opposed to force people to go to school at the age of eleven and study things that their brains</u>
<u n="1541" who="S0074">doesn't</u>
<u n="1542" who="S0018">really aren't</u>
<u n="1543" who="S0074">no</u>
<u n="1544" who="S0018">tut you know</u>
<u n="1545" who="S0074">are catered for</u>
<u n="1546" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that they can't get grasp</u>
<u n="1547" who="S0074">mm</u>
<u n="1548" who="S0018">um tut you know by by the age of twelve you've lost them</u>
<u n="1549" who="S0074">that's right</u>
<u n="1550" who="S0018">and they've become disruptive and</u>
<u n="1551" who="S0074">yeah</u>
<u n="1552" who="S0018">however if you get them into something or get them trying a lot of different things</u>
<u n="1553" who="S0074">that's right <pause dur="short"/> then they're much better people aren't they</u>
<u n="1554" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1555" who="S0074">rounded aren't they</u>
<u n="1556" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1557" who="S0074">much <trunc>rou</trunc> more rounded I think <pause dur="short"/> but yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's er</u>
