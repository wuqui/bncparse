<u n="188" who="S0558">yes</u>
<u n="189" who="S0517">the four sisters got a quarter each of the flat it was er yeah anyway mum had er she had about twenty-five thousand pounds from when nan sold her house</u>
<u n="190" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="191" who="S0517">and she very kindly gave all four grandchildren six thousand pounds</u>
<u n="192" who="S0558">oh</u>
<u n="193" who="S0517">so there's six thousand pounds that's already growing and I think <unclear>then</unclear> we added I can't remember where it came from <unclear/></u>
<u n="194" who="S0558">didn't your dad leave some money for them?</u>
<u n="195" who="S0517">no we haven't had any money from dad yet because mum's still alive</u>

<u n="197" who="S0517">we haven't had anything</u>
<u n="198" who="S0558"><unclear>well</unclear></u>
<u n="199" who="S0517">oh I know what it was we <trunc>w</trunc>when they were born you know we took out these baby bonds?</u>
<u n="200" who="S0558">oh yes yeah</u>
<u n="201" who="S0517">and they hadn't matured yet but the interest was <trunc>s</trunc>so abysmal that when we'd seen the financial our financial adviser he'd said do you know what?</u>
<u n="202" who="S0558">cash them in</u>
<u n="203" who="S0517">cash em in and we'd be better off</u>
<u n="204" who="S0558">that's what we did</u>
<u n="205" who="S0517">doing so er but because they we'd taken one out for each of them we put that with their money from mum so the anyway in effect they've got about ten thousand pounds each in junior ISAs I think they are or whatever they're in I don't know but the financial adviser is investing <unclear>em and</unclear> he says by the time that they're ready to use them that should be quite a nice sum so <unclear>for our</unclear> point of view we're thinking well that'll be a deposit on a house</u>
<u n="206" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="207" who="S0517">or something like that</u>
<u n="208" who="S0558">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="209" who="S0517">so they're very very lucky they've got those</u>
<u n="210" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0517">haven't got anything towards further education but you know we'll worry about that if and when that happens and then they've got money in their building society accounts <trunc>th</trunc>that they've had since they were born</u>
<u n="212" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="213" who="S0517">just like you said</u>

<u n="216" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="217" who="S0517">dad would put money in every year as pocket money like a lump sum just <trunc>gr</trunc>just growing that that we've always said we'll use that to buy a car with</u>
<u n="218" who="S0558">mm</u>
<u n="219" who="S0517">but <trunc>obv</trunc>obviously the insurance will be as much as the car</u>
<u n="220" who="S0558">mm</u>
<u n="221" who="S0517">so we'll end up doing that</u>
<u n="222" who="S0558">but there's these schemes you can get you know there's young driver schemes you can get</u>
<u n="223" who="S0517">mm</u>

<u n="229" who="S0517">oh okay</u>
<u n="230" who="S0558">so <trunc>i</trunc>it's worth looking into that sort of</u>
<u n="231" who="S0517">oh okay right yes</u>
<u n="232" who="S0558">the young drivers</u>
<u n="233" who="S0517">well I mean obviously we're still twelve months away</u>

<u n="245" who="S0517">yeah</u>
<u n="246" who="S0558">erm so what we will probably end up doing is things like leading up to the summer holiday we'll probably just insure him for a couple of months</u>
<u n="247" who="S0517">right yes yeah when he needs it yes</u>
<u n="248" who="S0558">so he's got access to it when he needs it</u>

<u n="265" who="S0517">what does he want to study?</u>
<u n="266" who="S0558">well initially he was thinking something more along the lines of geographical</u>
<u n="267" who="S0517">right</u>
<u n="268" who="S0558">like geography research you know all that sort of thing</u>
<u n="269" who="S0517">mm</u>

<u n="279" who="S0517">right</u>
<u n="280" who="S0558">because we went to the school show</u>
<u n="281" who="S0517">oh yes how was that?</u>

<u n="295" who="S0517">mm</u>
<u n="296" who="S0558">is that it? kind of thing don't get me wrong there was some there was some good sort of workshops set up so if you wanted to go down the trade of plumbing painter and decorator bricklayer that sort of thing there was an actual sort of situation set up you couldn't access it but you could see what sort of</u>
<u n="297" who="S0517">oh okay</u>
<u n="298" who="S0558">work environment you would be in</u>
<u n="299" who="S0517">right</u>
<u n="300" who="S0558">kitchens as well catering they've got you know</u>
<u n="301" who="S0517">oh okay</u>

<u n="306" who="S0558">yeah it was up right up</u>
<u n="307" who="S0517">mind you that's not something <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s ever shown an interest in so we but it was it's quite spread out the sections</u>
<u n="308" who="S0558">yes yeah</u>
<u n="309" who="S0517">we've possibly avoided it</u>
<u n="310" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="311" who="S0517">because oh okay</u>
<u n="312" who="S0558">so I thought that was good because for people looking in that area</u>
<u n="313" who="S0517">mm</u>
<u n="314" who="S0558">they can get a real feel</u>
<u n="315" who="S0517"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="316" who="S0558">for what it's all about but if you wanted to be a hairdresser or a beautician or a florist it was just a stand</u>
<u n="317" who="S0517">yeah</u>
<u n="318" who="S0558">but you know you <trunc>d</trunc> you could go to any local hairdressers or florists and say</u>
<u n="319" who="S0517">and get the same yes</u>
<u n="320" who="S0558">can I come and stand in here for a day and?</u>
<u n="321" who="S0517">yeah I thought there was quite a mix mishmash when I was there last year of some companies that seemed really geared up like people like er JP <trunc>Mor</trunc> what's it <trunc>J</trunc> er are they called JP Morgan?</u>
<u n="322" who="S0558">JP Morgan the bank?</u>
<u n="323" who="S0517">yeah</u>
<u n="324" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="325" who="S0517">you know really geared up to er talking to them as prospective apprentices and you know they had the current apprentices there and it was all you know and others it was just really wishy-washy and nothing substantial</u>
<u n="326" who="S0558">mm yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0517">I don't know</u>
<u n="328" who="S0558">that's how I felt a bit</u>
<u n="329" who="S0517">mm and and I think as well it was very low budget</u>
<u n="330" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="331" who="S0517">and I think when I've ever obviously I've only ever been to exhibitions on a from a business point of view where you've got companies spending mega amounts of money</u>
<u n="332" who="S0558">yes yeah</u>
<u n="333" who="S0517">on fantastic stands to woo customers</u>
<u n="334" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0517">because it's all about business whereas this</u>
<u n="336" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="337" who="S0517">there's no money involved this is just but that's for students <trunc>b</trunc> and er it's certainly reflected in the overall look and layout</u>
<u n="338" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0517">and even the</u>
<u n="340" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="341" who="S0517">lighting was bad</u>
<u n="342" who="S0558">I know that that's it you know</u>
<u n="343" who="S0517">it just was it was drab as a show</u>
<u n="344" who="S0558">mm</u>
<u n="345" who="S0517">I found it very <trunc>d</trunc> and I and as soon as I walked in I thought oh this is dreadful but er you know I <trunc>sor</trunc> <trunc>ha</trunc> sort of had to stop myself and think okay you've only ever been to exhibitions that you've exhibited at</u>
<u n="346" who="S0558">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0517">you've spent thousands on the space and the stand and it's all the latest you know you're trying to get customers</u>
<u n="348" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="349" who="S0517">this is not that at all</u>
<u n="350" who="S0558">and you have you have to put yourself in the shoes</u>
<u n="351" who="S0517">and you have to put that</u>
<u n="352" who="S0558">of a sixteen-year-old</u>
<u n="353" who="S0517">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="354" who="S0558">don't you? yeah</u>
<u n="355" who="S0517">but certainly there was you know</u>
<u n="356" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="357" who="S0517">there was a huge difference I thought in in the <vocal desc="misc"/> er what's the word? I don't know just <trunc>h</trunc>just how they pitched to the students</u>
<u n="358" who="S0558">mm</u>
<u n="359" who="S0517">and the quality of them</u>
<u n="360" who="S0558">yeah it wasn't inspiring I didn't think</u>
<u n="361" who="S0517">no</u>
<u n="362" who="S0558">I we <vocal desc="laugh"/> we must've been in and out in an hour</u>
<u n="363" who="S0517">well we</u>
<u n="364" who="S0558">we spent longer having a cup of coffee afterwards</u>
<u n="365" who="S0517">did you? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="366" who="S0558">and a hot chocolate <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="367" who="S0517">well the thing that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <trunc>g</trunc> took from it last year when we went was that if if you go down the route of wanting an apprenticeship you're much better off getting your A levels behind you</u>
<u n="368" who="S0558">so</u>
<u n="369" who="S0517">and getting your and getting a better level of apprenticeship</u>
<u n="370" who="S0558">yes</u>
<u n="371" who="S0517">just from talking to a few people they all said the same</u>
<u n="372" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="373" who="S0517">that if you've got GCSEs mm yeah okay it's fine if you've got A levels it's just be much much better</u>
<u n="374" who="S0558">see <trunc>y</trunc><trunc>y</trunc><trunc>y</trunc>you did more than us because I wasn't even interested in talking to anybody</u>
<u n="375" who="S0517">oh</u>
<u n="376" who="S0558">cos I said to them when we went in look if you see something that catches your eye</u>
<u n="377" who="S0517">mm</u>
<u n="378" who="S0558">just say and we'll stop and we'll go and talk to them</u>
<u n="379" who="S0517">but you had to you had to</u>
<u n="380" who="S0558">but I'm not gonna</u>
<u n="381" who="S0517">yeah</u>
<u n="382" who="S0558">keep saying to you</u>
<u n="383" who="S0517">mm</u>
<u n="384" who="S0558">because when you ignore me or reject me or say no thank you</u>
<u n="385" who="S0517">yeah</u>
<u n="386" who="S0558">I I feel like it's all a waste of time</u>
<u n="387" who="S0517">yes</u>
<u n="388" who="S0558">so if you're inspired let me know and we'll we'll talk to them <vocal desc="laugh"/> and he didn't</u>
<u n="389" who="S0517">say anything no</u>
<u n="390" who="S0558"><unclear/> nothing neither of them</u>
<u n="391" who="S0517">well I don't think well it was only <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I took <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> so the three of us went I dunno where <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was erm and er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would've been the same</u>
<u n="392" who="S0558">mm</u>
<u n="393" who="S0517">but we literally took him by the hand and made him talk to people</u>
<u n="394" who="S0558">yes</u>
<u n="395" who="S0517">and do you know what? I was pleased we went because I don't know if you remember we had found out about it by accident and do you remember it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> saying that their school they were putting on a busload and taking them</u>
<u n="396" who="S0558">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="397" who="S0517">and erm and I said well that's that's madness why isn't our school doing it? and it turns out our school did do it but it was just by invitation only and I was really quite annoyed cos I thought well <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is and I at that point we weren't sure if he was even gonna do A levels</u>
<u n="398" who="S0558"><unclear/></u>
<u n="399" who="S0517">and I <trunc>re</trunc>remember being a little bit annoyed thinking he would've been an ideal candidate to go on that school trip to the school show why why didn't he get invited?</u>
<u n="400" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="401" who="S0517">what <trunc>w</trunc> you know what basis did they? and I was bit annoyed that he hadn't gone however after we had been I said to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I'm so glad we took him because if he was there with his mates they he wouldn't've spoken to a soul</u>
<u n="402" who="S0558">no</u>
<u n="403" who="S0517">and it would've been a complete waste of a day</u>
<u n="404" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="405" who="S0517">but we took him and you know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'d say well how about this? <trunc>w</trunc>we'll just go and talk to them cos they're available</u>
<u n="406" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="407" who="S0517">and there was two or three that he came away and you could see he was a bit interested or he'd listened to what they'd said</u>
<u n="408" who="S0558">mm</u>
<u n="409" who="S0517">we did the erm I don't know whether you saw it in the business section there was one where you could go and pitch an idea to a couple of people it was a bit like Dragon's Den</u>
<u n="410" who="S0558"><unclear>right</unclear></u>
<u n="411" who="S0517">so they had a table full of objects and you had to just basically choose one of the objects compose yourself for two or three minutes</u>
<u n="412" who="S0558"><unclear/></u>
<u n="413" who="S0517">and then basically do a sales pitch to these two they were lovely lovely girls actually and erm they were really enthusiastic and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was going to do it and then he <unclear>sort of</unclear> no no <trunc>n</trunc>no you know I didn't want to he was all shy and everything and so they said er do it as a family come on so the three of us ended up doing a pitch for some</u>
<u n="414" who="S0558">oh</u>
<u n="415" who="S0517">ski hat <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had chosen but once he got into it like we sort of started him off and once he got into it you know he was fine and he was</u>
<u n="416" who="S0558">he was yeah</u>
<u n="417" who="S0517">and they gave him feedback and but it was the sort of thing that we came away and I said if if he'd've gone with the school it would've been a waste</u>
<u n="418" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="419" who="S0517">an absolute waste</u>
<u n="420" who="S0558">I think perhaps they got more involved on the two previous</u>
<u n="421" who="S0517">yeah</u>
<u n="422" who="S0558">well <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <unclear>one</unclear> the first time <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> went with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> when they they were at a car show with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="423" who="S0517">oh I remember you saying</u>
<u n="424" who="S0558">do you remember?</u>
<u n="425" who="S0517">and they just sort of saw it and went in as a</u>
<u n="426" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="427" who="S0517"><unclear/></u>
<u n="428" who="S0558">the second time last year <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> took them both whilst I was out with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and this year obviously me</u>
<u n="429" who="S0517">yeah</u>
<u n="430" who="S0558">so I think they may've spoke to people last time <vocal desc="laugh"/> but they wasn't interested this time the only one thing <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> did come away</u>
<u n="431" who="S0517">did they say it was the same same companies there each year?</u>
<u n="432" who="S0558">yeah they said it they said it was no different</u>
<u n="433" who="S0517">no different</u>
<u n="434" who="S0558">erm the one thing <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> did come away with <unclear/> <vocal desc="misc"/> was that excuse me he said he thinks he definitely doesn't wanna go into IT</u>
<u n="435" who="S0517">oh really?</u>
<u n="436" who="S0558">he doesn't yeah he said er I can't imagine myself sitting there all day like that looking at a screen</u>
<u n="437" who="S0517">mm mm</u>
<u n="438" who="S0558">he said and he said because of the nature of the work it's always getting better and improving and changing so you're always having to educate yourself</u>
<u n="439" who="S0517">yes</u>
<u n="440" who="S0558">he said and I don't want to feel like I'm always at school</u>
<u n="441" who="S0517">yeah</u>
<u n="442" who="S0558">when I'm at work</u>
<u n="443" who="S0517">oh well you see erm from that point of view just going in and deciding what you don't want</u>
<u n="444" who="S0558">it's eliminating</u>
<u n="445" who="S0517">yeah</u>
<u n="446" who="S0558">exactly</u>
<u n="447" who="S0517">yeah</u>
