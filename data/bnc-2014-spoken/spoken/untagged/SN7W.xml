<u n="1182" who="S0262">but anyway erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> <trunc>th</trunc>that's where I came in handy because I would work with the lecturers and say <pause dur="short"/> you can see what's missing <pause dur="short"/> tell me what you see that's missing <pause dur="short"/> I'll try and plug some of the holes <pause dur="short"/> on my end of things</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0354" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0262">and we'll see if we can come up with a programme that develops people's academic skills</u>

<u n="1186" who="S0262">really quickly</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0354">yes</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0262">so they don't lose too much of their learning or the content</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0354">sure</u>

<u n="1191" who="S0354">mm</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0262">and so we worked together like in that way and er we started this idea of embedding academic literacy into the course</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0354">mm</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0262">but that's when I realised that though the teachers wanted an <trunc>ear</trunc> an early an easy life <pause dur="short"/> they wanted to know how to teach <pause dur="short"/> they were too frightened to teach some of the bits <pause dur="short"/> that were quite tricky</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0354">yeah</u>

<u n="1198" who="S0262">they didn't want to convey it <pause dur="short"/> they didn't want to actually step in and say everyone <pause dur="short"/> okay this is discourse this is this this is that this is reading this is <trunc>thi</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> right we're all <trunc>n</trunc>novices together come on let's try and see if we can sort out what it is that we need to do <pause dur="short"/> so they left it to people like myself <pause dur="short"/> but I wouldn't have all the discipline knowledge</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0354">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>

<u n="1209" who="S0354">sure</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0262">that's another thing that they over-survey these students nowadays but <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> erm of course the head of department would see <pause dur="short"/> what your teaching rank was <pause dur="short"/> and it was only out of five it was only a scale of five <pause dur="short"/> it's not lots</u>

<u n="1225" who="S0354">sure</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0262">you know? and then <trunc>a</trunc>and then they started to see it but <pause dur="short"/> I think a lot of academics say <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>and they</unclear> seems to be saying it <pause dur="short"/> and I can understand why <pause dur="short"/> they said well when I got into university I had to pass every single exam and I had to pass it with flying colours</u>

<u n="1228" who="S0262">why is it that it's not the same</u>

<u n="1230" who="S0262">nowadays?</u>
<u n="1231" who="S0354">sure</u>

<u n="1236" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you know?</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0354">and <pause dur="short"/> it's er <trunc>b</trunc> it's because so many of the of the institutes of higher education shall we say for you know because they're not a lot of these colleges are not universities in the sense that we understood university</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>

<u n="1246" who="S0262">yeah it is yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="1248" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0354">er that and I think that's <pause dur="short"/> there's been a whole sea change in how people view higher education</u>

<u n="1251" who="S0354">a lot of people going into higher education now <pause dur="short"/> er are looking at it <pause dur="short"/> more in the light <trunc>o</trunc> that in our day would've been further education <pause dur="short"/> with a view to getting a job</u>
