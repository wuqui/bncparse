<u n="2856" who="S0454">well they <unclear/></u>
<u n="2857" who="S0579">oh really?</u>
<u n="2858" who="S0454"><unclear/> you know like an old egg timer so I I put the stop watch on <pause dur="short"/> cos if it's things like twelve minutes it's actually very difficult cos I have several things in the oven so I had the</u>
<u n="2859" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="2860" who="S0454">had the crumble going and I knew what time that would finish but then I put the fish in</u>
<u n="2861" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2862" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and that was supposed to be twelve minutes and I had the potatoes on</u>
<u n="2863" who="S0579">oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="2864" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and that's twenty-five minutes and we had the beans on which are four minutes</u>
<u n="2865" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2866" who="S0454">so I needed the fish to be timed properly</u>
<u n="2867" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="2868" who="S0454">cos if you get that wrong then <unclear/></u>
<u n="2869" who="S0579"><unclear/> and haven't done <unclear/> properly</u>
<u n="2870" who="S0454">it's quite a mathematical challenge</u>
<u n="2871" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2872" who="S0454">I think that you know that cos I had to think well that goes in first the</u>
<u n="2873" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>I know</unclear></u>
<u n="2874" who="S0454">well the crumble went in first because that was half an hour but I mean at least that evened the time <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but things like the potatoes you've got to work it out because the potatoes would take longer than fish</u>
<u n="2875" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2876" who="S0454">but then the <pause dur="short"/> beans would take less time than the fish you've got to have sort of timeline worked out</u>
<u n="2877" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2878" who="S0454">otherwise they all finish at the wrong time</u>
<u n="2879" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2880" who="S0454">and then it's cold <pause dur="short"/> ruined</u>
<u n="2881" who="S0579">oh dear dear <pause dur="short"/> oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="2882" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah the crumble worked perfectly</u>

<u n="2889" who="S0579">no no</u>
<u n="2890" who="S0454">but what he suggests is doing what you call the tray bake so you get a tray like that or any tray <pause dur="short"/> and you get chicken pieces</u>
<u n="2891" who="S0579">yes</u>
<u n="2892" who="S0454">like chicken thighs or chicken drumsticks whatever you like <pause dur="short"/> and then you put cherry tomatoes in <pause dur="short"/> erm basil and just cut it all up <pause dur="short"/> it takes five minutes</u>
