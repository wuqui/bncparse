<u n="77" who="S0655" trans="overlap">yeah it's five yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0653">you've got to choose five numbers</u>
<u n="79" who="S0655">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0652">and a bonus number</u>
<u n="81" who="S0653">and if you and a bonus number? why the bonus number</u>
<u n="82" who="S0655" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0652">that's the bonus ball</u>
<u n="84" who="S0653">what is that?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0652">you get five numbers and then the bonus ball so if you get all five numbers plus the bonus ball you win</u>
<u n="86" who="S0653" trans="overlap">so it's six numbers then? that's six numbers then isn't it?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0652">er</u>
<u n="88" who="S0653">why is it a bonus ball why doesn't it just have six numbers?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0652">well because you win a prize for five numbers as well so if you get four numbers and a bonus ball then</u>
<u n="90" who="S0653" trans="overlap">okay so last week two people in this country won thirty-three million pounds each</u>
<u n="91" who="S0655">oh there were some people who through they'd won the lottery but hadn't entered it properly</u>
<u n="92" who="S0653">oh no</u>
<u n="93" who="S0652">yeah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0655">and then they and then they</u>
<u n="95" who="S0652" trans="overlap">just imagine</u>
<u n="96" who="S0655">and then they had won really</u>
<u n="97" who="S0653">oh yes they hadn't got their credit or something or I don't know</u>
<u n="98" who="S0655">yeah and then they and then they they couldn't afford a lawyer cos they were broke</u>
<u n="99" who="S0653">right</u>
<u n="100" who="S0655">I think or something like that</u>
<u n="101" who="S0653">they just need to admit defeat I think don't they?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0652">mm</u>
<u n="103" who="S0655">no but the want but they really wanted a case</u>
<u n="104" who="S0653">but can the prove that they got the ticket that they did the numbers</u>
<u n="105" who="S0655">not sure yet</u>
<u n="106" who="S0653">I guess if they're the numbers they chose every single week</u>
<u n="107" who="S0652">mm</u>
<u n="108" who="S0653">but last week cos it was a very big one <pause dur="short"/> the the internet kind of the website kept breaking <pause dur="long"/> cos so many people were trying to last minute buy a ticket which is just ridiculous I think thirty-three million pounds is too much for one person to have I think they should just make it smaller amounts of money so like five hundred thousand pounds and more people to win I think that would be better</u>
<u n="109" who="S0654" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0653">cos then they would all carry on with their lives as normal but their lives would just be a little bit easier</u>
<u n="111" who="S0654">yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0653">but thirty-three million your live your lives completely change don't they?</u>
<u n="113" who="S0655">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0652">mm</u>
<u n="115" who="S0653">not always for the better</u>
<u n="116" who="S0652">if I won thirty-three million pounds</u>
<u n="117" who="S0653">you'd buy thirty-one million pounds worth of chocolate spread</u>

<u n="123" who="S0653">right</u>

<u n="139" who="S0652">of course</u>
<u n="140" who="S0654" trans="overlap">cos you're cos you're soon gonna marry her</u>
<u n="141" who="S0652">of course</u>
<u n="142" who="S0655">I'd probably</u>
<u n="143" who="S0652">and there would be babysitters on hand just in case mummy wanted to pop out and do the hoop for a while</u>
<u n="144" who="S0653"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="152" who="S0652" trans="overlap">oh right okay</u>

<u n="164" who="S0652" trans="overlap">I think we might have to extend the house out into the garden and not have a garden in order for that to happen or what you could do is build it up and have a flat roof and have like a a garden terrace on the top</u>

<u n="179" who="S0655" trans="overlap">and pay the or I could pay the neighbours to move out</u>
