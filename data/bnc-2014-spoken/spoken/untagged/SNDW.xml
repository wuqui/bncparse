<u n="195" who="S0644">but <pause dur="short"/> it was so <pause dur="short"/> that's how my idea came about it was from a place of genuinely trying to do something good</u>
<u n="196" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="197" who="S0644">which I thought was good erm but also cos I thought he's gonna make loads of money because like Zumba erm <pause dur="short"/> it's a new thing</u>
<u n="198" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0644">it's not really new but it is a new thing if you market it as a new thing and sell it as a new thing and I had I had everything done for it so basically what happened then was I spent</u>
<u n="200" who="S0607" trans="overlap">are are you gonna tell me <pause dur="short"/> a bit about how it would work? cos I'm curious to imagine</u>
<u n="201" who="S0644">well it's so simple it's so so so so simple so <pause dur="short"/> I wrote a manual on it because you had to write a manual for part of this bloody course erm <pause dur="short"/> exercises right you know squats?</u>
<u n="202" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="203" who="S0644">squats but holding onto the baby so you squat and then you lift up the baby and that's your shoulder press and then you twist</u>
<u n="204" who="S0607">no</u>
<u n="205" who="S0644">either standing or not standing basically I got a girl to do this once I got a girl to do a class with her baby</u>
<u n="206" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="207" who="S0644">and demonstrate so I could demonstrate and it was and she was properly in a sweat <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> exercise class</u>
<u n="208" who="S0607" trans="overlap">I bet that was really helpful cos you can then really see what <unclear/> could actually do</u>
<u n="209" who="S0644" trans="overlap">well it was it was so so so so good I think it was so good and I think it's the sort of thing that girls when you've had a baby they wanna get into shape but they don't wanna go to a gym and they it would have been a sociable thing it would have been a</u>
<u n="210" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="211" who="S0644">there were so many good things to it <pause dur="short"/> so and I thought and I kept thinking well why hasn't someone else done this then? like</u>
<u n="212" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="213" who="S0644">it's such a good idea and then I went on Youtube <pause dur="short"/> and loads of people have done it</u>
<u n="214" who="S0607" trans="overlap">was there a <unclear/>? <pause dur="short"/> were there any bits where she was laying down?</u>
<u n="215" who="S0644">yeah sit-ups crunches erm planks so many things you can do with a baby and they're more importantly they're things that you need to be able to do if you've got a baby you need to have be able to have good erm coordination and good core strength and good balance and</u>
<u n="216" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="217" who="S0644">good you know what I mean? like there's all these things that to</u>
<u n="218" who="S0607">and also</u>
<u n="219" who="S0644">oh</u>
<u n="220" who="S0607" trans="overlap">is there some bits where the baby is just laid there?</u>
<u n="221" who="S0644">yeah but</u>
<u n="222" who="S0607">but I was thinking <pause dur="short"/> part of</u>
<u n="223" who="S0644" trans="overlap">when you do a press-up <unclear/></u>
<u n="224" who="S0607" trans="overlap"><unclear/> is genius because you can just bring the baby</u>
<u n="225" who="S0644">that's it</u>
<u n="226" who="S0607">do you know what I mean? why should she not <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="227" who="S0644" trans="overlap">but it's actually a bonding thing for babies you see because</u>
<u n="228" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="229" who="S0644">you're <trunc>u</trunc> they like being picked up and held and moved and carried and sort of</u>
<u n="230" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="231" who="S0644">lifted and they like all that and <pause dur="short"/> it was work it was really work but most importantly it is what people fail to realise or seem to have <unclear/> realised is that it starts <pause dur="short"/> from the word go babies learning behaviour babies learning what's the thing to do so it's no good saying well when they're five I'm gonna start going to class I mean you can do it like that but</u>
<u n="232" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="233" who="S0644" trans="overlap">babies as young as two there's a problem with obesity is babies as young as two cos they're not moving enough they're not doing this and in this exercise you can see the baby was kicking and like all doing the things that they should do</u>
<u n="234" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="235" who="S0644">like moving and it was such a genius genius idea and when I would tell people about it they'd all go oh yeah that's a really good idea I'd do that I dunno if they were just being polite</u>
<u n="236" who="S0607" trans="overlap">and what did that girl think? the one who did it? the one</u>
<u n="237" who="S0644" trans="overlap">she thought it was a really good workout <pause dur="short"/> she she was sweating you could see she was out of breath</u>
<u n="238" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="239" who="S0644">and sweating and but the baby liked it the baby would like oh not that I'm gonna send it to you cos I'm sure you <unclear/> but you would see if I showed it to you</u>
<u n="240" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="241" who="S0644">anyway so <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> finds out I thought well look this is an idea and I thought if I don't do it I'll never know I'll never it's all very well isn't it talking about I've got this brilliant idea and I'm gonna do this and it's gonna if you don't actually do anything about it you'll never know</u>
<u n="242" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="243" who="S0644">so I thought to myself <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> that's what I'll do so I know I'd also realise from this point you're never gonna make a lot of money doing fitness stuff unless</u>
<u n="244" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="245" who="S0644">unless you come up with something original</u>
<u n="246" who="S0607" trans="overlap">a brand or something</u>
<u n="247" who="S0644">or come up with some or unless you were just happy doing all the classes and all the rest of it and</u>
<u n="248" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="249" who="S0644">anyway <pause dur="short"/> so erm <pause dur="short"/> in short what you have to do there's a company called reps it's called Register of Exercise Professionals and if you are a fitness instructor you have to belong to them and in order to belong to them you've gotta have insurance you've gotta have qualifications it's like Corgi registered you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="250" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="251" who="S0644">like if you're an electrician electrician</u>
<u n="252" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="253" who="S0644">it's like being Corgi registered that says you are legit erm</u>
<u n="254" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="255" who="S0644">you've got all the necessary things and you're fit to work in that industry</u>
<u n="256" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="257" who="S0644">it's basically another money spinning thing really erm so I phoned them up and I said look so if I have an idea of a course how do I go about it? and I said oh yeah yeah yeah we do all that <pause dur="short"/> in order to get your course endorsed which is what they call it you've gotta <pause dur="short"/> do this you know you've gotta do all</u>
<u n="258" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="259" who="S0644">follow this procedure you've gotta follow all this information so and it was not a straightforward thing you had to do a course to show that you're able to teach so a very like a basic teach your class <pause dur="short"/> so what</u>
<u n="260" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="261" who="S0644">what you do is you you get the idea and you develop it into a course and then the idea</u>
<u n="262" who="S0607" trans="overlap">do you have to pay for all of this?</u>
<u n="263" who="S0644">yeah through the nose and the idea would be that I've got this idea you're a fitness instructor you come on my course pay me the money then you're allowed to go and teach my course</u>
<u n="264" who="S0607">oh I see yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="265" who="S0644" trans="overlap">that's how that's how Zumba worked</u>
<u n="266" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="267" who="S0644" trans="overlap">that's how they made all their money cos they've got the Zumba <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> franchise or or brand you come and do the course then you can go and teach it</u>
<u n="268" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="269" who="S0644">and that's how you make your money <pause dur="short"/> so for example like you can pay a hundred and fifty pounds to do a day course up to a <trunc>hund</trunc> about a hundred and fifty pounds to do a day course more sometimes but I thought</u>
<u n="270" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="271" who="S0644">a hundred and fifty was quite a good amount now if you get six people on your course obviously you've gotta pay your taxes and all the rest of it and your room hire where you're gonna teach</u>
<u n="272" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="273" who="S0644">but six people hang on what is that?</u>
<u n="274" who="S0607">sorry I'm just <unclear>going</unclear> to unzip this thing <pause dur="short"/> seems to be shut no matter what I do</u>
<u n="275" who="S0644">that's a grand a day</u>
<u n="276" who="S0607">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and that's for when that's for when you're teaching them how to teach it</u>
<u n="277" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="278" who="S0607">oh sorry</u>
<u n="279" who="S0644">so like you know if you go on a creative <trunc>cour</trunc> creative writing course you pay your money</u>
<u n="280" who="S0607">but is it like an and is it like erm they can't teach your thing without you teaching them? like is there like erm</u>
<u n="281" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah a qualification</u>
<u n="282" who="S0607">but is it also a erm what d'you call it? a erm approved course? so that you have to have a but have you got like not copyright but do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="283" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah totally</u>
<u n="284" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="285" who="S0644">so like for me if I wanted to be able to teach spin <pause dur="short"/> in order to teach the spin class you have to go to a place where they are erm authorised you it belongs to that company basically and unless you've got the company approved course you you can't teach it</u>
<u n="286" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="287" who="S0644">erm so yeah that was the idea so I looked into it I <trunc>st</trunc> I wrote this manual and I took a job that was really rubbish money so that I could leave early in the day and have a day off a week erm <pause dur="short"/> to carry on doing <trunc>thi</trunc> cos there was no time you know what I mean? it's like anything else</u>
<u n="288" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="289" who="S0644">so I was writing this manual as it so happened <pause dur="short"/> I had January off last year because my dad had to have an operation on his leg</u>
<u n="290" who="S0607">oh yeah I remember</u>
<u n="291" who="S0644">do you remember? so I was off for a month looking after him and I'd do that in the evenings or in the day or whatever and do you want me to steer?</u>
<u n="292" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/> sorry</u>
<u n="293" who="S0644">I can steer I don't mind</u>
<u n="294" who="S0607">that's so bad isn't it? I've done I've finished now doing it now <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="295" who="S0644">carry on <pause dur="short"/> hold your stop</u>
<u n="296" who="S0607" trans="overlap">it's alright it's alright <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="297" who="S0644">it's not really bad</u>

<u n="302" who="S0607">yeah lightheaded and you know</u>
<u n="303" who="S0644">I could just do with a fix <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="304" who="S0607">I didn't know that we would have this I I don't I know that sounds daft but I just</u>
<u n="305" who="S0644" trans="overlap">what the woods?</u>
<u n="306" who="S0607">I didn't know that we would have this road <pause dur="short"/> I think I I haven't been able to understand how it all is but now I think we are officially in</u>
<u n="307" who="S0644">redwood territory</u>
<u n="308" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so you had January off <pause dur="short"/> to</u>
<u n="309" who="S0644" trans="overlap">and it <trunc>lit</trunc> it literally took about at least <trunc>ma</trunc> that's when I got most of the work done but I did so much research like there was a <pause dur="short"/> there was a woman called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I can't remember what her name is and she'd recently done this research she was from <anon type="place"/> so I was gonna say I went to <anon type="place"/> can I come and meet you to discuss your research and use it in my manual to prove that women should do exercise with babies?</u>
<u n="310" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="311" who="S0644">cos that's gonna go in my favour and all the rest of it blah blah blah blah blah blah blah <pause dur="short"/> so I did loads of work on it now I had checked before with these people I said I've got this idea can I do it? they yeah yeah that sounds fine all it means all it is you've gotta do this you've gotta do this you've gotta do this a course in that write this manual a course in this</u>
<u n="312" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="313" who="S0644">so I do had to do loads of courses on one of these courses I met this woman erm and she was really nice I really liked her <pause dur="short"/> and erm actually I'm not even gonna bother with that cos it's all just negative rubbish</u>
<u n="314" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="315" who="S0644">the bottom line is I did loads of work I went on two courses</u>
<u n="316" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0644">ah that's it I had to do a course another course in erm <pause dur="short"/> exercise for pregnancy in postnatal women</u>
<u n="318" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="319" who="S0644">especially cos if you're doing any <trunc>cou</trunc> some without getting like too into it you can imagine how much work went into it</u>
<u n="320" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="321" who="S0644">it took about a year longer really I took days off I got this girl to come and film the thing I had to get <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> my friend to film it</u>
<u n="322" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="323" who="S0644">I had to pay him to do that I had to ask the people that I used to work for doing personal training if I could have that room to do the filming in I had to do so much work then it got to this point <pause dur="short"/> erm where I was working through it's like a checklist and it says have you done this? have you done this? have you done this? have you done this? have you done this? have you done this? get to this point and it says explain why it's inappropriate to use babies as weights erm as part of a exercise thing and I thought well that's that's the entire gist of my</u>
<u n="324" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="325" who="S0644">thing so what do you mean? erm now I'd already seen another bit in the same fucking manual</u>
<u n="326" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0644">that says you can <trunc>b</trunc> exercise that involves babies and children can be done as long as you've done their prerequisite course which I've just been on</u>
