<u n="498" who="S0190">well the other bit the other take on that is the fact that one or the other of you mightn't be able to have children</u>
<u n="499" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes well yeah</u>
<u n="500" who="S0192" trans="overlap">which is which we've considered</u>

<u n="620" who="S0192">a a human language will cover every avenue possible the only difference is some languages have fewer words than other languages some languages have more consonants or more vowels but again you can't really use that as a basis to argue that one language is <pause dur="short"/> basically linguists would argue you can't say that any language is superior than any other language provided they fully use every function</u>
<u n="621" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="622" who="S0192">which when you study the language you</u>
<u n="623" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well the</u>
<u n="624" who="S0192">they ought to</u>
<u n="625" who="S0227" trans="overlap">the ultimate erm er aim for a language is to communicate</u>
<u n="626" who="S0192">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="627" who="S0227">if you're talking in a language that no one else understands <vocal desc="laugh"/> you're not communicating you might be talking a language but the person <pause dur="short"/> but the recipient doesn't understand what you're saying</u>
<u n="628" who="S0192">I've confused it a little bit though when I said about pigeons a pigeon <pause dur="short"/> is simpler a pigeon is a contact language that is nobody's first language</u>
<u n="629" who="S0190">yeah that's right a bit of this and a bit of that isn't it?</u>
<u n="630" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="631" who="S0192">the it's it's structured they have a structure because there are different there's a continuum of pigeons they're <trunc>mea</trunc> eventually a creole is when a pigeon becomes used as a first language</u>
<u n="632" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="633" who="S0192">and it's actually the children that create the grammar but it's part of our language faculty the children realise that they are missing they they don't have the right words for things</u>
<u n="634" who="S0227">so if</u>
<u n="635" who="S0192">so they fill it in</u>
<u n="636" who="S0192">so there are fillers in</u>
<u n="637" who="S0192" trans="overlap">so a creole used to a pigeon <pause dur="short"/> a pigeon when it becomes a first language is therefore needs to have every function that every other first language has and it becomes a creole</u>
<u n="638" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="639" who="S0192">so effectively yes you could say a pigeon is simpler but a creole isn't it's no different</u>
<u n="640" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="641" who="S0192">how did we get onto this conversation what were we talking about?</u>
<u n="642" who="S0227">er not sure</u>
<u n="643" who="S0192">I've just reeled on</u>
<u n="644" who="S0227">er probably because I said about bombastic er that</u>

<u n="646" who="S0227" trans="overlap">it's a your no</u>
<u n="647" who="S0192" trans="overlap">oh yeah you oh yeah okay so they're not gonna be analysing the kind of words of you're using</u>
<u n="648" who="S0227">I I know how to use the language but its its construct <pause dur="short"/> I</u>
<u n="649" who="S0192">you have a tacit understanding of of language</u>
<u n="650" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah your on your knowledge of er the construct is far superior to mine and I have to smile because <pause dur="short"/> erm when I left school although I could speak reasonably well I could not communicate on paper one of my</u>
<u n="651" who="S0192">whereas that was probably the main part of your job</u>
<u n="652" who="S0227" trans="overlap">a girlfriend taught me how to do that and it's I it took me three goes to do it I got a D with it the first time an E the second <pause dur="short"/> er my love life's got more complicated</u>

<u n="660" who="S0227">to to to be to really analyse the the language and it's and it's</u>
<u n="661" who="S0192">and it's my job</u>
<u n="662" who="S0227">yes exactly but when I look back at your father</u>

<u n="664" who="S0227">he came out of the school system and I I didn't know where full stops went commas inverted commas semi colons</u>

<u n="672" who="S0192">what do you think about negative concord? I don't do nothing <pause dur="short"/> when you hear that</u>
<u n="673" who="S0227">no I I would say I don't do anything not nothing</u>
<u n="674" who="S0192">yeah that would be what we consider correct the concord</u>
<u n="675" who="S0190" trans="overlap">the correct way of saying it</u>
<u n="676" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah I'd say anything yeah yes</u>
<u n="677" who="S0192">do you think negative concord is is bad if you heard somebody say like don't do nothing?</u>
<u n="678" who="S0190" trans="overlap">yes well it's not it's not bad is it? it just <pause dur="short"/> it's <pause dur="short"/> it's like saying well that's a nice cake we used to get slammed something terrible for saying writing nice because nice is not a good word</u>
<u n="679" who="S0227" trans="overlap">it's not descriptive</u>
<u n="680" who="S0190">no you can there are so many words in this language think of the one that you could use better there's there's like a lovely</u>
<u n="681" who="S0192">we do that today with <trunc>moth</trunc> er with intensifiers a lot of people will say oh it's very hot rather than it's scorching there are words to describe very hot</u>

<u n="684" who="S0190" trans="overlap">yes</u>

<u n="690" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I would agree with that and I don't think a linguist would disagree with that I think you know we do have these words at our disposable one when argue that we do have antonyms but there are no synonyms we'll and although you think that there are synonyms there aren't no two words are exactly identical they have slightly different connotations slightly different register</u>
<u n="691" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="692" who="S0192">therefore we can use we should and I think I <trunc>s</trunc> try and study new words and then I think what's the point because if we say it in front of someone they just think I'm a bit of an idiot why why would I use this word? am I trying to make them sound unintelligent? so you end up learning these enormous words and</u>
<u n="693" who="S0190" trans="overlap">yeah but you never know when you're going to do</u>

<u n="696" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="697" who="S0190">I mean you throw words in something and I think oh right</u>
<u n="698" who="S0227" trans="overlap">I I do if I</u>
<u n="699" who="S0190" trans="overlap">is this to muck around?</u>
<u n="700" who="S0227" trans="overlap">if I if I get upset or I feel erm</u>
<u n="701" who="S0192">you get cornered</u>
<u n="702" who="S0227">I the my words <trunc>beco</trunc> my I start <trunc>becom</trunc> I find that bigger syllables I remember throwing your your grandfather out of out of your mother's flat <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I'd said to him erm <pause dur="short"/> don't you cos he was <trunc>say</trunc> he was right he was springing from a a premise of of correctness he was saying <pause dur="short"/> your mum was <unclear>waiting</unclear> for you I didn't have a job but but they'd invited themselves they knew your mum wasn't there they knew your mum wasn't there I was there but they invited themselves and you see your nan and your grandad invited themselves er over and they were giving me a right lecture about what am I going to do and what are my prospects bugger all they had to be right <pause dur="short"/> maybe your grandad had said something and I said don't you think you're being a little overzealous? so he kind of came back with something that was completely you know like he didn't <trunc>un</trunc> you know er understand what I've said of course he completely you know the meaning of what I'd said so I had to repeat it and that's when I got on my horse and I said to him right I said if you don't <trunc>un</trunc> this was before I threw them out I said if you don't understand <vocal desc="laugh"/> what I'm saying would you like to continue this conversation in Spanish? I said I'm quite happy to accommodate you in either language I said because either you've lost the argument and it's time for you to go goodbye <vocal desc="laugh"/> and threw them out of your mum's flat</u>
<u n="703" who="S0192">I bet he loved you after that</u>
<u n="704" who="S0227">it took him a few years to forgive me for that yeah but I felt I felt cornered and the more cornered I felt the more upset I became was starting to use big er bigger words because I'd er used the words as weapons against you thinking you won't actually know what it is I'm talking about it</u>
<u n="705" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and people do that don't they?</u>
<u n="706" who="S0227" trans="overlap">and so I used overzealous aspect it was it was in the right connotation for the phrase but he didn't understand what it was I've just said</u>
<u n="707" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="708" who="S0227">so er yeah er so I I then became even more bombastic and said right if you can't understand this then why don't we speak in another language? I'll accommodate you either way erm but that that's it goodnight</u>
<u n="709" who="S0192">now the er er type of stylistic variation we accommodate we converge or diverge from the speakers that are around us we usually converge we like to sound more like the people around us so we have an affinity with those people</u>
<u n="710" who="S0227">I do at work</u>
<u n="711" who="S0192">but you can also do the opposite you can diverge because right at the moment I'm angry with you and I don't wanna sound like you I want to sound</u>
<u n="712" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="713" who="S0192">either superior to you or below you or whatever</u>
<u n="714" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah sooner er but I don't wanna be inferior</u>
<u n="715" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I don't wanna <event desc="unintelligible"/> with you yes</u>
<u n="716" who="S0227" trans="overlap">no you're gonna start to do that</u>
<u n="717" who="S0192" trans="overlap">so that that's convergence back to what I was saying about negative concord I don't have nothing sounds terrible to us</u>
<u n="718" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="719" who="S0192">but in most languages in the world Spanish <foreign lang="spa">no tengo nada</foreign></u>
<u n="720" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="721" who="S0192">I don't have nothing</u>
<u n="722" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well yeah yeah</u>
<u n="723" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it's exactly the same translation there is nothing wrong and in fact in middle English we use negative concord grammarians neo grammarians turned around and said that's wrong you can't do that and it's through these er prescriptive grammarians that went around and said an adjective must end L Y <trunc>w</trunc> all these rules that they said didn't reflect the usage of the language and kind of spelling as well English orthography there's all sorts of things where they eventually got wrong do you know the word debt? D E B T?</u>
<u n="724" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="725" who="S0192">they presumed so they went back and decided to spell the words and they presumed that it was from the Latin <foreign lang="lat"/> which is like to owe somebody or other but it wasn't it actually came from Germanic so they added a B into the spelling incorrectly the spelling should just D E T not D E B T</u>
<u n="726" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes cos it's they so it's</u>
<u n="727" who="S0192" trans="overlap">they did it incorrectly</u>
<u n="728" who="S0227" trans="overlap">it's a <trunc>te</trunc> it's a very silent B isn't it?</u>
<u n="729" who="S0192">there are lots of things the word knight used to be pronounced <unclear>kernicit</unclear> it was like a <vocal desc="misc"/> like a</u>
<u n="730" who="S0227">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="731" who="S0192" trans="overlap">lock like a <vocal desc="misc"/> a <vocal desc="misc"/> I think was the original one so old er orthography reflected how we used to pronounce things but now we don't pronounce it like that</u>
<u n="732" who="S0227">yes so it's gone <unclear/></u>
<u n="733" who="S0192">so it's why do we have these conventions? when I first got with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> it pained me to hear her say we was</u>

<u n="735" who="S0192" trans="overlap">she she says not so much anymore because I <trunc>y</trunc> hey <trunc>y</trunc> we were you can't say that</u>
<u n="736" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="737" who="S0192">she'd say it all the time</u>
<u n="738" who="S0227">yeah for teaching English you can't use that no</u>
<u n="739" who="S0192">I spent some time with her mum recently her mum does not have the word were in her lexicon she doesn't say it</u>

<u n="747" who="S0192" trans="overlap">what they do if you go up north there are certain places in Scotland that I've read about that use double modal auxiliary verbs modal auxiliary verb can could shall should may might well well would so for example they'll say a sentence I would could do that which to us sounds ridiculous</u>

<u n="749" who="S0192">I should might be able to <pause dur="short"/> which just sounds really really wrong to us but actually she fills a bit of a lexical gap because it it gives more probability to the rest of the situation so they are actually in a way more astute in what they're saying than than we are more accurate or precise</u>
<u n="750" who="S0227">one thing that that</u>

<u n="836" who="S0190" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>

<u n="849" who="S0192">because I've noticed more of a usage so I'm tempted to do a synchronic analysis of British public to see whether or not we are using more I can do a synchronic analysis by firstly analysing the youths and then analysing the elderly if the elderly don't do it but the youth do that suggests that it's changed</u>
<u n="850" who="S0227">yeah</u>

<u n="957" who="S0192">it's a bit weird to think that</u>
<u n="958" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="959" who="S0192">suddenly I'm a linquist <vocal desc="laugh"/> what's weird as well is when you tell people you're a linguist they go oh how many languages do you speak?</u>
<u n="960" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="961" who="S0192">but actually quite a few linguists don't speak a variety</u>

<u n="971" who="S0192">I want to at least be able to speak French and Spanish</u>

<u n="988" who="S0227">yes if you don't use it hence that's why I don't speak it <pause dur="short"/> so erm in everyday language so it took me a while to transpose what you'd said</u>
<u n="989" who="S0192">you have to have some respect for translators somebody that can sit there <pause dur="short"/> listen to what's being said <pause dur="short"/> and they they're translating about five to ten seconds later</u>
<u n="990" who="S0227">yeah</u>

<u n="993" who="S0192">they have to not only translate but work out <pause dur="short"/> I mean there's all sorts of semantic issues of how to change that into that I mean German is very difficult quite often Germans are the final language so the verb the predicate the most important part of a sentence comes right at the end of a sentence</u>
<u n="994" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="995" who="S0192">so you've gotta listen to the whole sentence</u>

<u n="999" who="S0192">and yet they've gotta translate and they're doing it very you know potentially you know there are some very precarious scenarios</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0192">and they can't mistranslate this because</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0227" trans="overlap">they have to be aware er er a sentence produced wrong could maybe</u>

<u n="2105" who="S0190">oh</u>
<u n="2106" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and they'd put some sugar on your hand and you've got like ants in there and stuff and you've got to blow the ants out but you know when you get sick and the last thing you ate have you ever had this experience?</u>

<u n="2111" who="S0192">I remember I got I mean obviously I was ill quite a few times in India and and one of the times I associated it with this and after that and the problem is it was rude to turn it down they'd often just put it in your hand afterwards and you'd be like oh I really don't want</u>

<u n="2117" who="S0227">no er or the only reason I'm saying that was <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc>it's interesting because that when we went to France your mum and I we didn't realise that she was pregnant with you she had Pernod which was aniseed based and she was violently sick</u>

<u n="2122" who="S0192">it's possible I've gone off a few things though because of being sick I tell you one of the worst experiences I've ever had was being sick on a camel safari in the desert in India and they camped us downwind from these terribly flatulent camels it was horrible I was so ill and like everything tasted bad my own <unclear>gas</unclear> was bad the all we had to eat was chapatti and a bit of dal and I just remember these camels kept farting and it was just horrible and we were sleeping out in the open as well you had like a scarab beetle like dung beetles like going around yourself</u>
