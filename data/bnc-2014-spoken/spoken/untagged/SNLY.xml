<u n="316" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="317" who="S0084">never <pause dur="long"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Ah <pause dur="short"/> so that's why they put the petrol cap on a lead <pause dur="short"/> on <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> the petrol cap is on a string when you take it off</u>
<u n="318" who="S0083">tut <pause dur="short"/> so you don't lose it</u>

<u n="320" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="321" who="S0084">and that's quite good considering <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s basic <pause dur="short"/> and what I didn't realize is that if you leave the car unlocked for a minute it she locks herself <pause dur="short"/> because I when</u>
<u n="322" who="S0083">I didn't know that</u>
<u n="323" who="S0084">when um tut when <trunc>Cl</trunc> um tut <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I were leaving for Tesco's the other night</u>
<u n="324" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="325" who="S0084">we came out of the  out of the  house and the next door neighbours had parked across our drive</u>
<u n="326" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="327" who="S0084">even though they go mental if we even</u>
<u n="328" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="329" who="S0084">park</u>
<u n="330" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="331" who="S0084">on their side <pause dur="short"/> they go absolutely mental</u>
<u n="332" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="333" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> so I had to ask them to move but I'd unlocked the car <pause dur="short"/> and I walked round into their you know</u>
<u n="334" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="335" who="S0084">up their path and the car locked itself</u>
<u n="336" who="S0083">tut <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="337" who="S0084">so that's good <pause dur="short"/> because I often think well <trunc>Ch</trunc> on <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s um tut lock it's one button <pause dur="short"/> whereas on <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s keys at least it's two</u>
<u n="338" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0084">it's <trunc>op</trunc> it's unlock and lock</u>
<u n="340" who="S0083">mhm</u>
<u n="341" who="S0084">but er I'm so used to pressing unlock when I'm I often press unlock when I mean to press lock when I'm walking away</u>
<u n="342" who="S0083">right <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="343" who="S0084">so it's reassuring to know that if I were to do that and not double-check</u>
<u n="344" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="345" who="S0084">it will just lock itself</u>
<u n="346" who="S0083">exactly</u>
<u n="347" who="S0084">which is really good I think for a basic model car <pause dur="short"/> to have those <trunc>f</trunc> features as standard and not something that you have to pay extra for</u>
<u n="348" who="S0083">absolutely <pause dur="short"/> no it is good</u>
<u n="349" who="S0084">Good old <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> uh <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/><pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="yawn"/> Hum num num num <pause dur="long"/> What are you doing?</u>

<u n="360" who="S0083">mhm</u>
<u n="361" who="S0084">so that's quite good <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="yawn"/> Cos obviously if I'm not paying for gym membership then I don't mind paying for fitness classes</u>
<u n="362" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="363" who="S0084">really <pause dur="short"/> and it's cheaper than doing them at the gym so</u>
<u n="364" who="S0083">mm</u>
