<u n="46" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="47" who="S0421">cos he got a letter on Monday and our postman comes at midday sometimes our postman comes at three o clock in the afternoon so that's when we got this letter and it was like oh if you don't send us these photocopies you may be charged but even if you do send us these photocopies you still may be charged if you're not eligible erm so yeah anyway we've not got so grandad had to go yesterday to <anon type="place"/> to get these photocopies like cos the post office the local post office doesn't do it neither does the newsagents so he got them and he sent them off erm and it says we <trunc>ne</trunc> we got it on Monday and then it says they need to have it by Thursday which is it's a bit short notice really isn't it?</u>
<u n="48" who="S0423">oh yeah so they must have a note on the system cos she said oh you need to be interviewed by another supervisor or erm <pause dur="short"/> they must have had a note saying may be not entitled to treatment</u>
<u n="49" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0423">and to you know wait for the interview but this this receptionist a little bit of information she gets it all blown out of proportion she starts saying</u>
<u n="51" who="S0421" trans="overlap">I know yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0423">she starts making up her own things</u>
<u n="53" who="S0421">that's what reception oh right did you? you know that? you know that reception?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>

<u n="59" who="S0421" trans="overlap">and then the surgery said oh no it never happened they never came in</u>
<u n="60" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0421">well mammy left a review on the NHS website for that surgery and she said how disappointed she was with the receptionist that they didn't take them on</u>
<u n="62" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0421">and she the the surgery replied and said I'm sorry but you weren't in our catchment area so they actually acknowledged that we went on the website so now mammy is sending a formal complaint she's written an email</u>
<u n="64" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah now they've admitted it yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0421">yeah cos now they've admitted that she's been</u>
<u n="66" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/> how stupid is that if you're going to deny that someone's been and then answer their comment on the internet saying oh well our system wouldn't accept you</u>
<u n="68" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well it just shows you that <unclear/> this woman this morning</u>

<u n="71" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0423">and she said oh that that doesn't mean he doesn't have to pay he that doesn't give you everything erm I said well I've got a a card and when I go to Europe I I I thought that I could have whatever treatment's needed and she said no no that'll just cover a consultation</u>
<u n="73" who="S0421" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="74" who="S0423">I said oh right oh I didn't know that</u>
<u n="75" who="S0421">no</u>
<u n="76" who="S0423">and then it got me thinking oh maybe</u>
<u n="77" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0423">cos then she said oh when I was in Amsterdam erm I had to go and see a doctor and I had to pay but it didn't you know it it just covered me for the erm <pause dur="short"/> the consultation</u>
<u n="79" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0423">so then erm <pause dur="short"/> so then oh right <pause dur="long"/> erm I said oh I I thought with the er with the card you get <trunc>what</trunc>whatever treatment it's a reciprocal arrangement you get whatever treatments you need and she said no I had to pay for my prescription in Amsterdam they said well <unclear/></u>
<u n="81" who="S0421" trans="overlap">you pay for it over here as well</u>
<u n="82" who="S0423">well well you pay a a set fee</u>
<u n="83" who="S0421">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0423">but in other European countries a lot of them you pay whatever the medicine costs</u>
<u n="85" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0423">and I said well yeah in lots of European countries you have to pay for a prescription that's what that <trunc>i</trunc> so obviously all you had to pay was for the prescription</u>
<u n="87" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0423">so she wasn't charged for treatment cos she probably didn't have treatment so you know? she's just making things up herself cos I said well he's you know? he's he's got the card and said oh that's er that doesn't mean this is very expensive you know? and I said yeah but we have a reciprocal arrangement with EU countries and she said erm well no no you can't just have anything if if if you just have them treated being allowed to be treated for anything we'd be full of people coming over for treatment</u>
<u n="89" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="90" who="S0423">it's just making up our own thing</u>
<u n="91" who="S0421">yeah but you'd get treated for free at home</u>
<u n="92" who="S0423" trans="overlap">I I mean I can't quite <unclear/> thinking well yeah you basically we bill them anyway</u>
<u n="93" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0423">so your grandad's thinking oh well can they invoice me? I'll go and see the medical people that I've got back home in <anon type="place"/> I think just wait for the the interview because I just thought she doesn't know what she's on about but then I said oh have you got that letter? so I started reading that that letter</u>
<u n="95" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0423">kind of indicated that he might have to pay because</u>
<u n="97" who="S0421">yeah</u>

<u n="99" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0423">I thought you know I can't believe this yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0421" trans="overlap">it's ridiculous isn't it?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0423">so then anyway this this <pause dur="short"/> person come for the interview said oh it's just that we hadn't received the eye grandad said oh he's sent it off</u>

<u n="110" who="S0423">they think they have you know? they they <unclear/> just so stupid</u>
<u n="111" who="S0421" trans="overlap">like whenever whenever we ring up for the doctor's they're like oh so what is it that's wrong? and then if you tell them they're like right well we can't that doesn't sound very serious so we can't make erm <vocal desc="laugh"/> an appointment for you <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="112" who="S0423">so they have to be half dead?</u>
<u n="113" who="S0421">yeah well <trunc>we</trunc> so</u>
<u n="114" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well you know? I think they are told by doctors now to ask that it's a bit intrusive isn't it?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0423">especially if you just walk in and just want to make an appointment</u>
<u n="117" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0423">and you have to say what's wrong in front of the waiting room</u>
<u n="119" who="S0421">you <trunc>ju</trunc> you could just lie <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="120" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0421">because erm I don't know what I was going in for it think it was something around my ear or something</u>
<u n="122" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="123" who="S0421">and erm it didn't hurt or anything but it was a bit fuzzy or something the sound</u>
<u n="124" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0421">and erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah but it <trunc>i</trunc>it was really annoying me so mammy was like yeah well we'll ring in the morning and you can go in and erm at first she said oh yeah it's just eh that's what she said and the receptionist was like right well we'll make you an appointment in two weeks or something</u>
<u n="126" who="S0423">jesus</u>
<u n="127" who="S0421" trans="overlap">and then so mammy was like yeah but she's in a lot of pain you know? she can't sleep at night and she's like oh oh right then you can come in this morning</u>
<u n="128" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="130" who="S0423">so you just have to tell them you're in pain</u>
<u n="131" who="S0421">yeah but then when you go into the doctor's it's just like they don't mind like</u>
<u n="132" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0421">they they don't know what you've said</u>
<u n="134" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0421">and the receptionist thinks oh you know? like but like for all like if someone's going in and they're like not necessarily in pain and they can see something that's wrong with them and then the receptionist like oh no you're going to have to wait two they might be in agony by the time they've waited two weeks</u>
<u n="136" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0421">they don't know what it is</u>
<u n="138" who="S0423" trans="overlap">I think it is it I mean they do have problems cos I think it is sort of a lot of people go in there's nothing wrong with the and they're just trying to weed out people aren't they? so I know why they're doing it but it's very frustrating if if you do have a problem and it's like they're trying to not see you isn't it?</u>
<u n="139" who="S0421">yeah <pause dur="long"/> I know but you'd rather people who don't have anything wrong with them go rather than people think oh there might not be nothing <trunc>wr</trunc> there might be nothing wrong with me so they don't go and then they end up with like a problem</u>
<u n="140" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I just think <vocal desc="misc"/> cos they are under a lot of pressure aren't they?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0421">yeah but if you look up anything online it's like you should have this seen by a doctor</u>
<u n="142" who="S0423">yeah well that's why you shouldn't look anything up online</u>
<u n="143" who="S0421" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="144" who="S0423">should just go to the doctor if you're ill don't <trunc>bo</trunc>bother looking it up online</u>
<u n="145" who="S0421">no but if you look up something and you're like oh right I've had like a pain or something <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="146" who="S0423">yeah but if you look up anything <unclear/> they tend to tell you you'll be dead in a few minutes</u>
<u n="147" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="148" who="S0423">if you don't get seen go to the doctor immediately</u>
<u n="149" who="S0421">no they don't always no but some</u>
<u n="150" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well well a lot of the time they do <unclear/></u>
<u n="151" who="S0421" trans="overlap">no but sometimes there's something and it's like oh <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> it could be nothing but go and see the doctor anyway</u>
<u n="152" who="S0423">yeah it's a it's it could be nothing or you could be about to have a brain haemorrhage</u>
<u n="153" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="154" who="S0423">so you better go immediately</u>
<u n="155" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="156" who="S0423">cos that's probably for a headache or</u>
<u n="157" who="S0421">yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="158" who="S0423">oh <trunc>d</trunc> our <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s had to go to the hospital she had problems breathing and had pains in her chest and and erm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0421" trans="overlap">really?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0423">I think she called an ambulance out er <unclear>when</unclear> she had a problem ah she was going back home</u>
<u n="161" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0423">she had a problem breathing so they came out to the ambulance and they said oh can't find anything wrong it must be just a panic attack</u>
<u n="163" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="164" who="S0423">she had pains in her chest but then afterwards it carried on so she went to the doctor's</u>
<u n="165" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0423">and the doctor checked her chest and said well there doesn't seem to be anything there I'll give you some antibiotics cos he heard like a rattling noise</u>
<u n="167" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0423">when he was listening to her chest and assumed it must be an infection and then erm <pause dur="short"/> she she was still in pain like quite a bit of pain so she she rang the doctor again I think the doctor did say if it's not right at a certain time come back and or ring me</u>
<u n="169" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0423">or so she rang him I think had a phone consultation or something so he arranged for her to have an X ray <pause dur="short"/> so the X ray <unclear/> erm <pause dur="short"/> she's had to stay in hospital cos <unclear/> the wall of her lung is punctured</u>
<u n="171" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="172" who="S0423">there's a hole in it so it's amazing isn't it?</u>
<u n="173" who="S0421">I know</u>
<u n="174" who="S0423">cos I mean I guess pains in your chest and problem breathing they must have listened to her heart and checked if there was any problems there</u>
<u n="175" who="S0421">mm</u>
<u n="176" who="S0423">so it wasn't until they did the X ray cos it continued that and they say tall young skinny females it can happen to them</u>
<u n="177" who="S0421">mm</u>
<u n="178" who="S0423" trans="overlap">I don't know whether it's cos of your rib cage <unclear/> skeleton or something</u>
<u n="179" who="S0421" trans="overlap">maybe</u>
<u n="180" who="S0423"><unclear/> on the outside you're a <pause dur="short"/> of your lung or something but</u>
<u n="181" who="S0421">cos it's unusual that cos usually you can get a punctured lung if you break a rib</u>
<u n="182" who="S0423">well yeah I thought <unclear/> first when I heard I thought she'd been involved in an accident</u>
<u n="183" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0423">you know? it's usually only if you've had an accident <unclear/></u>
<u n="185" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah you break a rib and then it punctures your lung yeah <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="186" who="S0423">but yeah supposedly tall and skinny sort of slim young girls get it <pause dur="short"/> and erm I don't know it must be cause some must be to do with the everything is so tight in there I don't know</u>
<u n="187" who="S0421">yeah maybe yeah maybe if you've got like quite erm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
