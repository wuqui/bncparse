<u n="8" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="9" who="UNKFEMALE" whoConfidence="low">I don't know what really what that was for but it was well they''re that long</u>
<u n="10" who="S0565" trans="overlap">about that long yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0564">erm looked a little bit like erm an adder but it wasn't quite the same colouring same pattern but not the same colouring</u>
<u n="12" who="S0565" trans="overlap">very very similar pattern yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0564">and she got that out and</u>
<u n="14" who="S0543" trans="overlap">oh</u>

<u n="23" who="S0564" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="24" who="S0543">like that I could probably do that trial as well but that was really bad even for someone who didn't mind snakes there were so many in there</u>
<u n="25" who="S0564">mm</u>
<u n="26" who="S0543">and they said that it was the worst trial that they'd ever done</u>
