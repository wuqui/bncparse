<u n="757" who="S0517" trans="overlap">okay okay</u>
<u n="758" who="S0518">because I knew everything that had gone happened with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had all gone so bad and that we were gonna lose our friendship because of our own just lustful selfishness erm</u>
<u n="759" who="S0517"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="760" who="S0518">that risking another friendship that involved children and something much bigger just wasn't even worth it it just wasn't even worth the thought of it whether I'd wanted to or not it just wasn't even worth it and I had to I just had to make that really really clear but then I suppose</u>
<u n="761" who="S0517" trans="overlap">so since then so for nine months he hasn't taken no for an answer?</u>
<u n="762" who="S0518">no because obviously then I was poorly I was signed off work</u>
<u n="763" who="S0517">mm</u>

<u n="782" who="S0518" trans="overlap">what</u>
<u n="783" who="S0517">and that is what's happened</u>
<u n="784" who="S0518">yeah and <trunc>bec</trunc> but because we've been friends and known each other for a long time and I don't <pause dur="short"/> I felt it very difficult to just <trunc>s</trunc></u>
