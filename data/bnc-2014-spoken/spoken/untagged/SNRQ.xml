<u n="8" who="S0170">mm mm</u>
<u n="9" who="S0018">or something it would the you could <trunc>prob</trunc> you could probably deal with the the boredom of the admin tasks cos it's an exciting context <pause dur="short"/> but then if you're talking about an insurance company</u>
<u n="10" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0018">or a firm that makes hangers <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="23" who="S0018">oh really?</u>
<u n="24" who="S0170">but it's really low pay <pause dur="short"/> but once you've done that for a couple of years you can do that plus the course at the same time you can become a speech therapist through it</u>
<u n="25" who="S0018">oh wow <pause dur="short"/> that's em</u>
<u n="26" who="S0170">it's really hard to do to get in to do it</u>
<u n="27" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0170">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I want to find something that's not too far away <pause dur="short"/> I found one in Wolverhampton <pause dur="short"/> I did apply for that that was last year <pause dur="short"/> but I didn't get</u>
<u n="29" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0170">shortlisted so</u>
<u n="31" who="S0018">so what you'd start off as an assistant speech therapist?</u>
<u n="32" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0018">ah</u>
<u n="34" who="S0170">and whilst you're doing that do a course</u>
<u n="35" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0170">and then you can become a speech therapist or there's a one year course but it's in Essex or London</u>
<event desc="sound of baby crying"/>
<u n="37" who="S0018">eh huh <pause dur="short"/> oh what's wrong?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0170">you'll have it with your relevant degree and then you can do a one year sort of like fast track to be a speech therapist</u>
<u n="39" who="S0018">fantastic</u>
<u n="40" who="S0170">I was interested in it but I'm not sure it's just</u>
<u n="41" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0170">now I've got little <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="43" who="S0018">and what do they class as a relevant degree?</u>
<u n="44" who="S0170">well something with <trunc>lang</trunc> well languages <pause dur="short"/> linguistics em <pause dur="short"/> they didn't really list it what what it was but I think linguistics was a main one</u>
<u n="45" who="S0018">what did you study?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0170">linguistics and Spanish</u>
<u n="47" who="S0018">oh really?</u>
<u n="48" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0018">ah <pause dur="short"/> that sounds really interesting <pause dur="short"/> when you're a speech therapist what em is that working with the NHS?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0170">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they that so they they've got their</u>
<u n="51" who="S0018">so yeah tell me about speech therapy <pause dur="short"/> is it  is it  quite em a demanding course?</u>
<u n="52" who="S0170">I think so <pause dur="short"/> I mean I read about the modules a bit and it's quite an intense one year course</u>
<u n="53" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="54" who="S0170">because you have to learn about everything but and I think you have to specialise <pause dur="short"/> I wanted to either do em speech therapy for people who have had brain injuries or children</u>
<u n="55" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0170">so but then to do the speech therapy em <trunc>a</trunc> assistant you had to have some experience of working with children</u>
<u n="57" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="58" who="S0170">before so <pause dur="short"/> I didn't have that</u>
<u n="59" who="S0018">oh don't you? Have you not taught kids?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0170">I taught for two weeks one Easter <pause dur="short"/> but em I haven't done it more than that <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="61" who="S0018">and doesn't having your own kid?</u>
<u n="62" who="S0170">well now I have</u>
<u n="63" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="64" who="S0170">now I have and I'll see how his language develops <pause dur="short"/> well I've heard cos he'll be hearing cos he's hearing Polish and English that he'll take <trunc>l</trunc> longer to start speaking</u>
<u n="65" who="S0018">yeah I heard that <pause dur="short"/> cos I did em psycholinguistics in my degree and wrote wrote a paper about the bilingual lexicon <pause dur="short"/> and yeah I heard that that they develop they still develop the two language systems you know like natives?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0018">but they do take a little longer</u>
<u n="68" who="S0170">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos you can imagine it's a lot to take in isn't it? It takes long enough when you're learning one language</u>
<u n="69" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="70" who="S0170">let alone two <pause dur="short"/> em my friend who was from Quebec</u>
<u n="71" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0170">in Canada <pause dur="short"/> so she spoke like French and I think her mum was eh German <pause dur="short"/> so in her house she heard English German and <trunc>F</trunc> French and she said she used to say sentences in a mixture of all three languages <pause dur="short"/> cos she knew something like cup she only knew it in French <pause dur="short"/> so she'd say the whole sentence in English but the French word for cup and she didn't know what it was in in English</u>
<u n="73" who="S0018">I miss speaking Spanglish <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> most of my friends in Spain were em English speakers and Spanish speakers <pause dur="short"/> so you could always mix up the two languages in a sentence <pause dur="short"/> cos some expressions or some words</u>
<u n="74" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0018">different languages have better ways of <trunc>sa</trunc> expressing it <pause dur="short"/> so it's it's weird not using eh Spanglish</u>
<u n="76" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0170">my thing was I put English grammar <pause dur="short"/> we use the English grammar but with Spanish words <pause dur="short"/> sometimes I didn't know and you know you'd be like what?</u>
<u n="78" who="S0018">so when did you learn Spanish?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0170">just doing the degree I think that was my mistake <pause dur="short"/> I thought well but <anon type="place"/> Uni offered it as an intensive <pause dur="short"/> but it wasn't really that intensive it was like six hours a week</u>
<u n="80" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="81" who="S0170">and then you were supposed to finish your degree the same level as someone who's done GCSE plus A level</u>
<u n="82" who="S0018">blimey</u>
<u n="83" who="S0170">so</u>
<u n="84" who="S0018">that's eh that's a lot</u>
<u n="85" who="S0170">and it was then we were  we were  put together then after the first year with people who had done GCSE A-level plus the first year</u>
<u n="86" who="S0018">crikey</u>
<u n="87" who="S0170">and then <pause dur="short"/> intensive</u>
<u n="88" who="S0018">and did you spend time in Spain as part of your degree?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0170">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was in Granada</u>
<u n="90" who="S0018">oh lovely</u>
<u n="91" who="S0170">for nine months and I thought I understood some Spanish but when I went to Granada I didn't understand anyone</u>
<u n="92" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0170">except my landlord and he was an English teacher <pause dur="short"/> and he spoke really slowly and everything <pause dur="short"/> my friend I know how she did it <pause dur="short"/> she didn't speak a word <pause dur="short"/> she was from Germany</u>
<u n="94" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0170"> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> and she phoned up places not speaking any Spanish trying to find a place to live <pause dur="short"/> how would how you know what do you say to them on the phone? Cos I wouldn't have done it</u>
<u n="96" who="S0018">it is so much more difficult on the phone as well isn't it cos?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0170">yeah we did have when I was when em and luckily I was with eh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and she spoke very good Spanish <pause dur="short"/> she's Italian <pause dur="short"/> she she learnt really quickly and em she would speak to people on the phone and arrange but sometimes they wouldn't want eh non Spanish</u>
<u n="98" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0170">there were certain areas that we phoned and they would say no sorry</u>
<u n="100" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0170">we want Spanish speakers <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0018">I guess they didn't want people who would be only there for like nine months or something</u>
<u n="103" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0170">and <pause dur="short"/> hey</u>
<u n="106" who="S0018">have you been back to Granada's since you lived there?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0170">no I haven't <pause dur="short"/> I want to I want to go with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and show him where I lived and everything <pause dur="short"/> I was really lucky we found a lovely apartment in em</u>
<u n="108" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="109" who="S0170">and it was like a the traditional part</u>
<u n="110" who="S0018">whereabouts is that? I know Granada a little bit em yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0170">it's up by it's not far from The</u>
<u n="112" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="113" who="S0170">so it is really close and like that's on top of the hill and it's down the side</u>
<u n="114" who="S0018">ah lovely where all the little white houses are</u>
<u n="115" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0018">with the patios and aw</u>
<u n="117" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0018">that is</u>
<u n="119" who="S0170">but we did <pause dur="short"/> we had one of the <trunc>ol</trunc> apartments where you know you got the square hole in the middle and</u>
<u n="120" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="121" who="S0170">and it's quite dark</u>
<u n="122" who="S0018">I like them though</u>
<u n="123" who="S0170">but it's lovely</u>
<u n="124" who="S0018">nice</u>
<u n="125" who="S0170">very traditional Spanish</u>
<u n="126" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> and did you go to uni while you were there?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0170">I did yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think that's why my Spanish is very em passive knowledge I</u>
<u n="128" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0170">I can watch Spanish films <pause dur="short"/> I can hear people speak and I can understand but trying to put sentences and express myself</u>
<u n="130" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's difficult isn't it? If you don't practice actually producing it it's it's a lot more difficult to <pause dur="short"/> cos you learn a lot of words through <trunc>li</trunc></u>
<u n="131" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0018">hearing them don't you?</u>
<u n="133" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0018">but you you don't your brain doesn't actually automatically throw them out until you've actually used them</u>
<u n="135" who="S0170">welI I read Spanish and I say em like I understand that story so I don't understand then why I don't know it when I try and speak <pause dur="short"/> it's really weird I and I just really</u>
<u n="136" who="S0018">I think there's some theory that says you have to use a word seven plus or minus two times before your brain can produce it</u>
<u n="137" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0018">so you can  you can  recognise it but you have to actually <trunc>produc</trunc> produce it <pause dur="short"/> you know a <trunc>ce</trunc> a certain amount of times before <trunc>y</trunc> you know it's integrated into your vocabulary <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="139" who="S0170">mm <pause dur="short"/> but the accent as well when I went to Granada it's <pause dur="short"/> they say it's like a Brummie accent here <pause dur="short"/> people make fun of the the accent from down south in Spain and and when I came back here and spoke with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> eh boyfriend</u>
<u n="140" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="141" who="S0170">he said oh you sound like you're from Granada</u>
<u n="142" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="143" who="S0018">is he from the north?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0170">I think so <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0170">no <pause dur="short"/> madrid</u>
<u n="147" who="S0018">ah <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="148" who="S0170">he's from Madrid</u>
<u n="149" who="S0018">well in Granada do they speak with like if they say gracias do they say gracias or <trunc>gr</trunc>?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0170">mm <pause dur="short"/> and they cut the end off of everything</u>
<u n="151" who="S0018">eh <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> it's similar like</u>
<u n="152" who="S0170">gracia</u>
<u n="153" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> similar in Murcia</u>
<u n="154" who="S0170">yeah they don't have the Ss on the end <pause dur="short"/> it's like como esta?</u>
<u n="155" who="S0018">but did you practice it a lot or did you like em have a lot of Spanish friends and speak with them or was it a more Erasmus students sticking together?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0170">more Erasmus students <pause dur="short"/> not not so much but we were in the faculty of em of translation and interpretation <pause dur="short"/> well not you know the translation part</u>
<u n="157" who="S0018">yes</u>
<u n="158" who="S0170">you know translation em part and a lot of the students wanted to practice their English with you</u>
<u n="159" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="160" who="S0170">but they said this university was like the equivalent of Oxford and they were you could tell it was  it was  very good</u>
<u n="161" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0170">university and their English was very good</u>
<u n="163" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="164" who="S0170">with no accents some of the younger students</u>
<u n="165" who="S0018">well they learn it from such a young age over there don't they?</u>
<u n="166" who="S0170">and and you can imagine they like the equivalent of the like rich students <pause dur="short"/> they've probably been sent to England every summer and and they they speak English incredibly well <pause dur="short"/> so they just used to practice with us <vocal desc="laugh"/> with me <pause dur="short"/> another English guy there we always used to get people wanting to to talk with us in English and em <trunc>h</trunc> he was the same he didn't improve his Spanish <pause dur="short"/> he was quite good before but he was there with his family and that was different</u>
<u n="167" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> and did you live with the Italian girl?</u>
<u n="168" who="S0170">I lived with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who's from Italy and another girl from Poland</u>
<u n="169" who="S0018">uh-huh <pause dur="short"/> so you spoke English at home?</u>
<u n="170" who="S0170">yeah but we we tried sometimes to speak in Spanish</u>
<u n="171" who="S0018">it's really unnatural though isn't it? It's difficult <pause dur="short"/> no I was lucky when I went to Spain because I was apart from Lisa who's em bilingual cos her father's Spanish and her mother's English <pause dur="short"/> all my friends over there were Spanish <pause dur="short"/> so I had to start producing it and</u>
<u n="172" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="173" who="S0018">and I <trunc>wa</trunc> I was lucky in that respect is that I became fluent in about six months <pause dur="short"/> I knew nothing when I went there <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0170">it is <pause dur="short"/> I things like having to order and by the end I mean I could do all things like I would things I had to do quite often ordering bombones</u>
<u n="175" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="176" who="S0170">things like that or having having to eh I went to the dentist and had to explain in in Spanish what what was wrong and <pause dur="short"/> you know and and things like that <pause dur="short"/> my Spanish was a lot <trunc>be</trunc> my Spanish was a hell of a lot better than when I went I would say</u>
<u n="177" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="178" who="S0170">I was a beginner when I went <pause dur="short"/> I didn't understand anything</u>
<u n="179" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> but it's the yeah the communication likely you were able to communicate in a shop <pause dur="short"/> it's the thing that probably comes first isn't it?</u>
<u n="180" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="181" who="S0018">is you're interacting in society were your  were your  classes in Spanish?</u>
<u n="182" who="S0170">they were <pause dur="short"/> they were well and this is the funny thing <pause dur="short"/> because it was the translation and I had to take a language <pause dur="short"/> so I learned Italian</u>
<u n="183" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="184" who="S0170">I ended  I ended  up giving a presentation in Italian oh <pause dur="short"/> giving a presentation in Italian when I was there to learn Spanish</u>

<u n="200" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="201" who="S0018">you're not necessarily translating <pause dur="short"/> you're not really developing the skill of translating <pause dur="short"/> cos if you learn it through immersion you have kind of a separate system in your head</u>
<u n="202" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="203" who="S0018">so I found it quite difficult to to I don't know sometimes English would just sound <pause dur="short"/> when I translated it into English it just didn't sound English <vocal desc="laugh"/> and I didn't have that capability of being able to</u>
<u n="204" who="S0170" trans="overlap">yeah I had to  yeah I had to change it I did one module of theory and of translation and that was quite interesting</u>

<u n="209" who="S0018">mm</u>

<u n="221" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="222" who="S0170">who did the lesson in English</u>
<u n="223" who="S0018">ah</u>
<u n="224" who="S0170">and eh so that was  that was  I mean cos then he would always use me as the the person to explain things</u>

<u n="231" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="232" who="S0170">because everyone else was with Erasmus students</u>
<u n="233" who="S0018">mm hm</u>

<u n="236" who="S0170">and she was talking constantly in Spanish with me</u>
<u n="237" who="S0018">fantastic <pause dur="short"/> while you were in Morocco speaking French too no?</u>
<u n="238" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="239" who="S0018">you had a right hotch potch of languages <pause dur="short"/> spanish eh Italian at home</u>
<u n="240" who="S0170">oh I know <pause dur="short"/> I know <pause dur="short"/> it was <trunc>ju</trunc> it was just so funny that I couldn't believe that I'd gone to Spain and ended up my main exam was a presentation in Italian</u>
<u n="241" who="S0018">my friend <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> he came over to <anon type="place"/> University to do the Erasmus and he was living in a house full of Italian people</u>
<u n="242" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="243" who="S0018">and his English actually improved quite a lot when he was there but he learned fluent fluent Italian <vocal desc="laugh"/> when there as well</u>
<u n="244" who="S0170">I think <trunc>I</trunc> Italian and Spanish was <trunc>com</trunc> it complicates thing because they're so similar</u>
<u n="245" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> definitely</u>
<u n="246" who="S0170">really similar that some sometimes you I'd be <trunc>prono</trunc> pronouncing things like the Italians would <pause dur="short"/> and in my I had an intensive Spanish class as well at the language centre</u>
<u n="247" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="248" who="S0170">which was good <pause dur="short"/> I really really enjoyed that <pause dur="short"/> cos they did it <trunc>Es</trunc> how we teach ESOL here</u>
<u n="249" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="250" who="S0170">which it all like at university it was very dry</u>
<u n="251" who="S0018">yeah more like studying it as opposed to learning how to use it</u>
<u n="252" who="S0170">yeah and then I but I really enjoyed those classes <pause dur="short"/> but all my classmates were Italian except for em well the German girl and I was like sometimes I didn't understand when they spoke Spanish because <pause dur="short"/> and the teacher said you know why because they're not speaking Spanish to me they're speaking Italian</u>
<u n="253" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="254" who="S0170">and they're just hoping that it's <trunc>Span</trunc></u>
<u n="255" who="S0018">but it is it's so similar <pause dur="short"/> I think sometimes it might be more difficult to learn a language that is similar to yours because you know it it comes so naturally to you</u>
<u n="256" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="257" who="S0018">to say something a certain way as if it's completely different <pause dur="short"/> maybe it's easier to remember <pause dur="short"/> but no when I I think I went to India about seven years after I'd started living in Spain?</u>
<u n="258" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="259" who="S0018">and I hung out with a couple of Italian people and I was surprised that I could understand pretty much everything that they were talking about</u>
<u n="260" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="261" who="S0018">because I spoke Spanish</u>
<u n="262" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="263" who="S0018">and I spoke Spanish to them they understood and they'd speak Italian back to me and and I'd understand</u>
<u n="264" who="S0170">and French helps as well if you've got French and Spanish then you can understand pretty much everything</u>
<u n="265" who="S0018">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="266" who="S0170">Cos there's a lot of crossover between them <pause dur="short"/> if it's not similar to Spanish then it's similar to French</u>
<u n="267" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but no saying that all the Erasmus students <pause dur="short"/> the em the ones who did <trunc>ha</trunc> get English friends they made fantastic progress but I remember we were living in in the first year with some I think they were Chinese maybe? Em and they just stayed together in their little social groups all the time and</u>
<u n="268" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="269" who="S0018">it was funny <pause dur="short"/> at six o'clock all the Chinese people would walk across the quad there was like em all the the accommodation was around <trunc>out</trunc> a grassy quad and they'd all be there carrying their woks and their their ingredients over to someone's <pause dur="short"/> they appointed someone's house every night to go and eat together in <pause dur="short"/> but they'd just stick together all the time and they didn't learn at all</u>
<u n="270" who="S0170">yeah that's like the <unclear/> students <pause dur="short"/> they're the ones we had in the summer isn't it?</u>
<u n="271" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I'm em friends on Facebook with quite a few of the students we had</u>
<u n="272" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="273" who="S0018">mm last summer not the ones from the summer before</u>
<u n="274" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="275" who="S0018">but and I thought because they were  they were  art students they were all doing oh you know from the eh mine were fashion and</u>
<u n="276" who="S0170">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> I had one fashion</u>
<u n="277" who="S0018">interior design <pause dur="short"/> and they I got the feeling that they'd make more of an effort to actually integrate and meet people and <trunc>s</trunc> communicate</u>
<u n="278" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="279" who="S0018">in English more than the students we'd had the years before who were doing business and stuff</u>
<u n="280" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0018">but</u>
<u n="282" who="S0170">it was hard over the summer though who who did they have to integrate</u>
<u n="283" who="S0018">but they haven't</u>
<u n="284" who="S0170">no</u>
<u n="285" who="S0018">they've all joined the Chinese church and all of their social activities revolve around the Chinese church</u>
<u n="286" who="S0170">really?</u>
<u n="287" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I think the only English they're getting is em at university</u>
<u n="288" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="289" who="S0018">they haven't you know made any English-speaking friends</u>
<u n="290" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="291" who="S0018">and all their status updates are in Chinese and it it's just such a shame cos</u>
<u n="292" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="293" who="S0018">I understand during the presessional course</u>
<u n="294" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="295" who="S0018">you know they stick together cos it's a new a totally different situation for them</u>
<u n="296" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="297" who="S0018">it would be comforting to to have you know Chinese around them but they</u>
<u n="298" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="299" who="S0018">it seems like they're doing it all the time <pause dur="short"/> it's a shame</u>
<u n="300" who="S0170">yeah <pause dur="short"/> there are a few people I mean there's I don't know if you know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>? <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <trunc>they</trunc> they've em integrated well I think</u>
<u n="301" who="S0018">have they?</u>
<u n="302" who="S0170">they're they're coming on really well</u>
<u n="303" who="S0018">oh super</u>
<u n="304" who="S0170">they are but <trunc>the</trunc> they're Taiwanese and not Chinese</u>
<u n="305" who="S0018">ah <pause dur="short"/> yeah actually the Taiwanese students I heard they already had a better level of spoken English?</u>
<u n="306" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="307" who="S0018">their written ability wasn't great but do do they speak English</u>
<u n="308" who="S0170">yes</u>
<u n="309" who="S0018">more in Taiwan?</u>
<u n="310" who="S0170">they must do <pause dur="short"/> I don't know why why it was but they didn't need the visa did they? So maybe they're from</u>
<u n="311" who="S0018">eh <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="312" who="S0170">one or two had had been here before</u>
<u n="313" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="314" who="S0170">and maybe for like summer or something <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="315" who="S0018">and what are they doing? Are they em meeting up with their course mates and stuff and speaking English?</u>
<u n="316" who="S0170">yeah they're just like writing things on Facebook in English and they have they seem to have friends from other nationalities <pause dur="short"/> maybe not just English but maybe <trunc>Eras</trunc> I don't know if they were European students who are their friends and stuff <pause dur="short"/> that's encouraged them to use English</u>
<u n="317" who="S0018">that's good</u>
<u n="318" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="319" who="S0018">that's fantastic <pause dur="short"/> no I reckon when they do the presessional that they shouldn't all be put together in a hall of residence <pause dur="short"/> it's it kind of creates a ghetto doesn't it?</u>
<u n="320" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="321" who="S0018">and it sets them up with bad habits from the start <pause dur="short"/> I think if they  if they  had a home stay for the five or ten weeks and a presessional</u>
<u n="322" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="323" who="S0018">and actually integrated into life in a family and kinda got a bit more exposed to the culture and embraced living in a different country</u>
<u n="324" who="S0170" trans="overlap">yeah that's and and separate them when don't let them choose the same roommates for a whole year</u>
<u n="325" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="326" who="S0170">and get to separate and</u>
<u n="327" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="328" who="S0170">but the the people who have moved out it's like they were eh one <trunc>coup</trunc> they were one couple and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and another one <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> they've all <trunc>mo</trunc> they all moved out when they had that opportunity to move out</u>
<u n="329" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="330" who="S0170">and they they're the ones who are doing better</u>
<u n="331" who="S0018">yeah it's not surprising isn't it?</u>
<u n="332" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="333" who="S0018">that's the thing it was so difficult to improve their marks over the ten weeks of the course</u>
<u n="334" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="335" who="S0018">Cos you know</u>
<u n="336" who="S0170">you're just speaking with well just in the class with us but then</u>
<u n="337" who="S0018">and even then they weren't particularly forthcoming in speaking in English <pause dur="short"/> actually I I think by the end I think they've been trained to</u>
<u n="338" who="S0170">I'm pretty good for the first couple of weeks they spoke nothing but English</u>
<u n="339" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="340" who="S0170">and then it's slowly slid into</u>
<u n="341" who="S0018">as their social life <pause dur="short"/> because they didn't really know each other before did they? I think they became more socially em active with each other they started slipping into Chinese more <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I guess it's typical</u>
<u n="342" who="S0170">I don't know it is hard learning a language <pause dur="short"/> it's not an easy thing especially when you  when you when you  start when you're older <pause dur="short"/> I mean I I learnt French at school but I it was a large class of thirty or so students <pause dur="short"/> I didn't think I really knew French but I still remember some phrases but I I was definitely not fluent or anything in it</u>
<u n="343" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="344" who="S0170">and apart from that I've never studied a language and then I suddenly started Spanish</u>
<u n="345" who="S0018">but it must have been easier for you to learn a bit of Spanish because your brain was used to learning French?</u>
<u n="346" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0018">I think just the the skill of of being able to memorise words and spot patterns even if you can't speak it fluently it's definitely</u>
<u n="348" who="S0170">I don't know it's how how how easy it was to learn Italian</u>
<u n="349" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="350" who="S0170">not even just cos of the similarities but it was it just is easier the more you use that part of the brain</u>
<u n="351" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="352" who="S0170">I think it does get easier to <trunc>remem</trunc> remember words and everything</u>
<u n="353" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> definitely</u>
<u n="354" who="S0170">but it was funny cos every time I wanted to think of a Spanish word I think of the Italian word</u>
<u n="355" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="356" who="S0170">or <pause dur="short"/> even now like I'm learning a bit of Polish and I'm trying to think of the Polish word I think of the Spanish word <pause dur="short"/> and it's like oh</u>
<u n="357" who="S0018">are you going to classes for Polish or?</u>
<u n="358" who="S0170">no <pause dur="short"/> I'm just trying to learn from home with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and his son</u>

<u n="443" who="S0018">does it have a lot of tenses or is it?</u>
<u n="444" who="S0170">it's em not tenses <pause dur="short"/> I forgot what they call it when it's one word em it's a  it's a  verb like in Spanish where you change it fully to the person</u>

<u n="456" who="S0170">there are eight cases</u>
<u n="457" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="458" who="S0170">so it changes <pause dur="short"/> cos I know like I'm sure he said something about <trunc>wor</trunc> work cos it's <foreign lang="pol"/> and it's <foreign lang="pol"/> and so I'm knowing it's about work but I'm not sure who it's talking about his work or their work or</u>

<u n="460" who="S0170">I don't know the endings of the verbs and that</u>
<u n="461" who="S0018">that's so complicated <pause dur="short"/> so does every different conjugation in every different tense have eight possibilities depending on the case?</u>
<u n="462" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="463" who="S0018">but that just makes</u>
<u n="464" who="S0170">what is it German has eight cases and this one has seven</u>
<u n="465" who="S0018">for a lot <pause dur="short"/> but still that's a lot a mighty load of endings to remember</u>
<u n="466" who="S0170">it is <pause dur="short"/> cos like I'll say like em <trunc>l</trunc> little <pause dur="short"/> but that you in Spanish like <foreign lang="pol"/> or <foreign lang="pol"/> depending on male or masculine or feminine</u>
<u n="467" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="468" who="S0170">and then he says something else and it's like well why have you changed it for that?</u>
<u n="469" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="470" who="S0018">yeah I remember the I I didn't  I didn't  even get my head around the concepts of the different cases <pause dur="short"/> I think when I was I think I was only twelve when I'd studied Latin</u>
<u n="471" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="472" who="S0018">but is it stuff like genitive accusative dative?</u>

<u n="474" who="S0018">mm hm</u>
<u n="475" who="S0170">so I like trying to learn it <pause dur="short"/> it would be really hard</u>
<u n="476" who="S0018">have you a teach yourself book?</u>
<u n="477" who="S0170">I <trunc>ha</trunc> there is <pause dur="short"/> I have got a work book and a textbook <pause dur="short"/> I think I need help with it I don't think</u>

<u n="479" who="S0170">it's all in em Polish so I just <pause dur="short"/> and I don't want like learning a language like that</u>
<u n="480" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="481" who="S0170">either</u>
<u n="482" who="S0018">but you might find because you're hearing a lot of it em if you get a a teach yourself book and just start to become aware of all the different endings and all the different you know pick up some more vocabulary <pause dur="short"/> maybe you'll start thinking when you <trunc>he</trunc> listening to eh huh that would be that word</u>
<u n="483" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="484" who="S0018">with that ending</u>
<u n="485" who="S0170">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think I'll learn better I think I'm an oral learner rather than a</u>
<u n="486" who="S0018">uh-huh <pause dur="short"/> ah no I'm a visual learner <pause dur="short"/> I need to see it written down before I <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="487" who="S0170" trans="overlap">are you? No that's not how I learn best I think watching films in Spanish and being in the classroom just listening  just listening</u>
<u n="488" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="489" who="S0170">it helped me a lot</u>
<u n="490" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I remember a phase that that I went through I think it was about three months after I I <trunc>st</trunc> I lived in Spain? Em and I could <trunc>ju</trunc> I could just put together sentences and express pretty much a lot of basic things and have conversations socially</u>
<u n="491" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="492" who="S0018">but because I could put together a sentence quite easily em then people would think oh she speaks Spanish they'd just go brrrrr back <pause dur="short"/> so I developed this em defence mechanism of just not letting other people reply just speaking speaking speaking and not giving them a little space to <trunc>re</trunc> respond <vocal desc="laugh"/> Cos as soon as they'll something and I'll be like I don't know what you've just said sorry <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="493" who="S0170">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and when you've learnt it you've learnt you say this then they say that then you say this and then they say that and then you say it and they say something completely different and it's like em</u>
<u n="494" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="495" who="S0018">one tiny word can throw you <pause dur="short"/> no I em before I went to Spain I I got a BBC teach yourself Spanish book</u>
<u n="496" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="497" who="S0018">and it was it wasn't it was all communicative in that every at the beginning of every chapter there was a little dialogue</u>
<u n="498" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="499" who="S0018">and then afterwards it picked apart of the dialogue in terms of vocabulary and the different little grammar bits that we use but as chunks not</u>
<u n="500" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="501" who="S0018">okay we're gonna learn the present tense <pause dur="short"/> no it was what was used in that dialogue</u>
<u n="502" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="503" who="S0018">was explained <pause dur="short"/> and I thought that was a fantastic way of of learning <pause dur="short"/> it helped me a lot</u>
<u n="504" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="505" who="S0018">to to be able to recognise a lot of speech <pause dur="short"/> obviously producing it was more difficult after but</u>
<u n="506" who="S0170">mm <pause dur="short"/> I remember being in in Spain somebody coming up to me and I'm thinking I understand what they're saying but they're not speaking <event desc="sound of sneezing"/></u>
<u n="507" who="S0018">oh bless you</u>
<u n="508" who="S0170">bless you <pause dur="short"/> they're not speaking Spanish to me and then I realise they were Italian</u>
<u n="509" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="510" who="S0170">and I didn't see it and I was studying Italian at the time and that was really bizarre because I don't <pause dur="short"/> I didn't know what to reply <pause dur="short"/> I understood what they'd asked me but I wasn't sure how to reply cos I like that's not Spanish but for a second I was a bit frightened that someone has come up to me in Spain and spoke to me not in Spanish but just in Italian and I was a bit confused</u>
<u n="511" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I had that when I went to em I went to em I went to Monaco with eh two Spanish friends and an English friend and I was the only one who spoke French <pause dur="short"/> and the two Spanish friends didn't speak much English</u>
<u n="512" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="513" who="S0018">so we were  we were  pretty much operating in Spanish apart from me and the English girl we were talking English to each other</u>
<u n="514" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="515" who="S0018">but everything any kind of interaction with the French world had to come through me <pause dur="short"/> so she'd say it to me in English and I had to translate and then the Spanish guys would speak to me in Spanish and I had to translate that into French and there was a moment when just my head and exploding <pause dur="short"/> especially because it was culturally as well I was interpreting <pause dur="short"/> because em the two guys from eh Murcia they we were at breakfast and they wanted to order toast with tomato on</u>
<u n="516" who="S0170">oh no</u>
<u n="517" who="S0018">I said yeah but look in <trunc>Fr</trunc> we're in France you can have croissant you can have pain au chocolat you can have anything sweet and pastry like but toast with tomato on is not part of their culture <pause dur="short"/> hello what do you mean? Everyone's got toast <pause dur="short"/> surely they've got some tomatoes <pause dur="short"/> I was like they don't know how to do it</u>
<u n="518" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="519" who="S0170"><foreign lang="spa"/></u>
<u n="520" who="S0018">then again I remember in the first month I think I was in Spain I ordered toast with tomato on and I thought it was gonna come in slices of tomato and when it came with just yeah</u>
<u n="521" who="S0170">like the tomato paste on</u>
<u n="522" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos they just squeeze out the juice and grate a bit of the flesh into it</u>
<u n="523" who="S0170">mm</u>
<u n="524" who="S0018">and add olive oil and I was like where is the tomato? I ordered tomatoes and they were like it's there on it and I felt very put out</u>
<u n="525" who="S0170"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I remember ordering tea with milk <pause dur="short"/> just getting a <trunc>h</trunc> a cup of hot milk with a tea bag in it</u>
<u n="526" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="527" who="S0170">so I had to soon learn to say can I have eh tea with milk separate</u>

<u n="529" who="S0170">yes my friend was laughing she was <trunc>I</trunc> she was Italian she was laughing at me <pause dur="short"/> another Italian girl I my friend and we went we travelled round a little bit <pause dur="short"/> and she just laughed at me because of my face when I was given this tea with milk with a tea bag in it <pause dur="short"/> I was so disappointed cos I like my tea in the morning <pause dur="short"/> I could cope with coffee I don't mind <pause dur="short"/> it was such strong coffee wasn't it?</u>
<u n="530" who="S0018">yeah no I always had em decaf in a sachet</u>
<u n="531" who="S0170">mm hm</u>
<u n="532" who="S0018">and just a cup of hot milk and I'd just sprinkle a bit of decaf coffee and <pause dur="short"/> cos yeah they make it so strong</u>
<u n="533" who="S0170">yeah</u>
<u n="534" who="S0018">then again when I was in France I used to have em le petit noir like a tiny little cup of really intense coffee <pause dur="short"/> and when I was like eighteen nineteen I could quite happily drink three or four a day but when I don't know what when I was about twenty-one twenty-two I just developed this complete my body couldn't take caffeine <pause dur="short"/> I think maybe I'd drunk too much in France <pause dur="short"/> em yeah it was just ah</u>

<u n="536" who="S0018">yum yum yum yum <pause dur="short"/> yeah I hated olives before I went to Spain and then it was cos when you visit people's houses they always want to give you things to eat and drink and you know it's from their  from their  earth <pause dur="short"/> olives <pause dur="short"/> how can you not like olives? It used to be like a personal insult so I'd have to eat olives and then I actually developed quite a taste for them which is good cos they're nice and healthy</u>
