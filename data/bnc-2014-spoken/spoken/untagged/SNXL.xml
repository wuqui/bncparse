<u n="1" who="S0282">so anyway erm <pause dur="short"/> so what I'm hoping is that an extra <unclear/> you will <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> and used <pause dur="short"/> erm well not only from <anon type="place"/> but from other places and in other contexts if you were advising oh well so let's say <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and and and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> from</u>
<u n="2" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="3" who="S0282" trans="overlap"><anon type="place"/> what what would you say is <unclear/> key things to be learned in setting up and running an initiative of this kind?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0289">mm <pause dur="short"/> well I'll tell you what my starting point is</u>
<u n="5" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="6" who="S0289">one is knowing what you want to achieve and why</u>
<u n="7" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="8" who="S0289">so you have a perfectly good <unclear/> <vocal desc="cough"/> I think that <pause dur="short"/> you and I had never written <unclear/> this plan before</u>
<u n="9" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="10" who="S0289">but we wrote a version of what a business plan then I thought was now I look back on it it was pretty good</u>
<u n="11" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="12" who="S0289">because we really tested the waters on everything and made sure if things could have that <unclear/> on the income after it was done</u>
<u n="13" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0289">and what we did that was <pause dur="short"/> what was important is that we didn't start from the fact that we needed money <pause dur="short"/> we started from the fact although undoubtedly we did we started to say how could this be a manageable <pause dur="short"/> and workable <pause dur="short"/> building</u>
<u n="15" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="16" who="S0289">that enough local people would want to use that it could actually we can actually say that it would be used <unclear/> we've done our work</u>
<u n="17" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0289">and they would produce enough income to make it run because what was there before was <pause dur="short"/> a building with high aspirations and no way <unclear/> written all down would've ever paid for itself</u>
<u n="19" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="20" who="S0289">they set it up <unclear/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0282" trans="overlap">and it didn't</u>
<u n="22" who="S0289">and it didn't</u>
<u n="23" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="24" who="S0289">so <pause dur="short"/> I think that research we did do you remember what we did the er draft business plan? we put in I think we even had a photo <pause dur="short"/> of every space that was left there</u>
<u n="25" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0289">we gave <unclear>it a</unclear> page and under each one we missed it <pause dur="short"/> the local people who'd made inquiries to us about using enough space</u>
<u n="27" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="28" who="S0289">and that showed and we have three or four under some of them some of them <unclear>were</unclear> around by the time we finished the work</u>
<u n="29" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="30" who="S0289">but then we were always one step forward saying we want to have a look at it</u>
<u n="31" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0289">and we could then check out that each of those <pause dur="short"/> that the bigger users <pause dur="short"/> were going to be viable</u>
<u n="33" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="34" who="S0289">and could actually pay us the kind of rent it needed to keep the building running</u>
<u n="35" who="S0282">well yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0289">so that was a really really good <pause dur="short"/> first stage analysis of local need and demand</u>
<u n="37" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0289">and checking that that could be added together to make a sustainable business plan <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> I remember our first projections of budget people like them those businessmen that came on board with us they would look at the whole business plan that they always started on the cash flow page even if it was the back page they'd start at the back because they would work back from that to know if we'd done our proper homework</u>
<u n="39" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0289" trans="overlap">which as it turned out we had</u>
<u n="41" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0289">and so I think that that is the absolutely crucial first step we could've said our aim was to get enough money to keep the building going <pause dur="short"/> but that was <pause dur="short"/> that's a by-product of having a well-run building</u>
<u n="43" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0289">erm <pause dur="short"/> and from being manageable we were told that we didn't need a seven-star <unclear/></u>
<u n="45" who="S0282" trans="overlap">I know</u>
<u n="46" who="S0289">we structured it so that we could do it on one and a half</u>
<u n="47" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0289">or one and three quarters cos we did end up with a <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> some of the time</u>
<u n="49" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0289">but we had a half time admin a full time manager and eventually some box office but the box office was actually paid for by our tenants</u>
<u n="51" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0289">primarily because they were the ones who needed people to <unclear/> in and get a box office</u>
<u n="53" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0289">so we actually minimised the things we <pause dur="short"/> that were costing the most money which is <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> and you have the doors and things and everything out in the building putting such a way that you could let full time in some spaces and occasionally on others and others you would rent it out the entire spaces</u>
<u n="55" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0289">erm and you know that that audit was the first thing that</u>
<u n="57" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0289">checking that the space was really needed and wanted</u>
<u n="59" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="60" who="S0289">and that people who were needing and wanting it I remember I was talking about the fact that we would have to check that each one of those was viable <pause dur="short"/> and a lot of them we did I know</u>
<u n="61" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0289">I know <pause dur="short"/> when they came in you know erm the restaurant <pause dur="short"/> was viable</u>
<u n="63" who="S0282">it was</u>
<u n="64" who="S0289">erm and they had put together their plan properly and we could see it was but the cinema wasn't</u>
<u n="65" who="S0282">oh is that what happened? I never worked out what happened to the cinema</u>
<u n="66" who="S0289">what happened to the cinema was <pause dur="short"/> two <unclear>faults</unclear> one the cost of construction of the cinema is <pause dur="short"/> victoriously high because <pause dur="short"/> er erm <pause dur="short"/> the safety factors that you have to build in have never been updated from when the only cinema happened all over the country and they were working with <unclear/></u>
<u n="67" who="S0282">oh it's just very flammable</u>
<u n="68" who="S0289">and it was highly flammable so you had to all kind of protect that stuff when we could've spent our entire budget on turning that main room the conference room</u>
<u n="69" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah that actually <unclear/></u>
<u n="70" who="S0289">no it wouldn't we we</u>
<u n="71" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="72" who="S0289">couldn't have done it it would've cost too much</u>
<u n="73" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="74" who="S0289">to do it structurally</u>
<u n="75" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0289">and the insurance would've been <pause dur="short"/> er the <trunc>wor</trunc></u>
<u n="77" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0289" trans="overlap">as well and it was a silly thing to do you have to prove your case when you've got to <anon type="place"/> across the road the business case was just not there</u>
<u n="79" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="80" who="S0289">and it was when <pause dur="short"/> I don't know how you whether you I remember having a long conversation to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> about this cos I was being called <pause dur="short"/> racist because we weren't going to have the black cinema in <pause dur="short"/> because it wasn't viable <pause dur="short"/> and I said to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> am I being racist? <pause dur="short"/> and he said <pause dur="short"/> er no you're just looking at my business plan and saying it won't cut together and we never mentioned black in it and half of the others that are gonna come in loads of them are black and they presented</u>
<u n="81" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0289">a <unclear/> case so</u>
<u n="83" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0289">it's got nothing to do with anything</u>
<u n="85" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="86" who="S0289">but you will that is a card that people use if they want to make you flinch</u>
<u n="87" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0289">erm <pause dur="short"/> so that's like being manipulated by basically was like he's saying so that side we <pause dur="short"/> we had to check out each of our tenants could really pay</u>
<u n="89" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0289">erm <pause dur="short"/> I think there was another church write help them look at their plans cos they had something like an after school club coming into their church hall <pause dur="short"/> and erm their <pause dur="short"/> grant from their local authority <pause dur="short"/> to pay for the it was gonna be paid for by the local authority the letting was gonna be completely covered</u>
<u n="91" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="92" who="S0289">and so I said to the church hall committee <pause dur="short"/> whatever you do take the money in advance of their booking <pause dur="short"/> about three or four years later they came to me said we don't know what to do the arts school club owes us twenty-three thousand pounds</u>
<u n="93" who="S0282" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0289">because they keep saying they're gonna pay their rent but they never do so we leave them in cos we keep hoping we'll get it</u>
<u n="95" who="S0282">oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0289" trans="overlap">and of course it meant that they would never get it</u>
<u n="97" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0289">so no you can't go there erm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0282" trans="overlap">aha</u>
<u n="100" who="S0289">I don't of course they never did get it</u>
<u n="101" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0289">what happened was the after school club spent their grant on all kinds of maths stuff</u>
<u n="103" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0289">and not on paying the rent cos they're still in</u>
<u n="105" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> there the <trunc>wor</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc>there's the worse group as well which I can't <trunc>re</trunc> <unclear/> brave when you get so far stuck into something you can't pull out because <pause dur="short"/> erm you've already invested so much that</u>
<u n="106" who="S0289" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="107" who="S0282"><unclear/> actually cutting off and losing your investment</u>
<u n="108" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="109" who="S0282" trans="overlap">that's so prohibited</u>
<u n="110" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0282">that you just carry on and that's what we did with <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> cos that</u>
<u n="112" who="S0289" trans="overlap">completely</u>
<u n="113" who="S0282">you just get to the point where you think <pause dur="short"/> if you sell them out you'll never see that money again</u>
<u n="114" who="S0289">well one of the lessons if I was gonna look at it I wasn't involved in the board at that point but do you remember in the early days <pause dur="short"/> we had a set of <unclear/> point of about <pause dur="short"/> sixty percent let</u>
<u n="115" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0289" trans="overlap">fifty-three percent maybe</u>
<u n="117" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="118" who="S0289">if we were sixty-three percent let we would <pause dur="short"/> er cover all our costs</u>
<u n="119" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0289">we never wanted to be a hundred <trunc>perce</trunc> we never wanted it to we had to have it all let</u>
<u n="121" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0289">and then we said we would <trunc>ge</trunc> never allow a single tenant <pause dur="short"/> to have more than I think it was about sixty percent of the building</u>
<u n="123" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="124" who="S0289">if we'd have forty percent coming in from one tenant it would've made a lot of difference but <anon type="place"/> did get about ninety percent</u>
<u n="125" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0289">of the building</u>
<u n="127" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0289">and that that broke a rule we started with</u>
<u n="129" who="S0282">I know it's actually in it's actually not <unclear/></u>
<u n="130" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0282">so erm <trunc>a</trunc></u>
<u n="132" who="S0289" trans="overlap">and that I don't know where it came from but it was <trunc>a</trunc></u>
<u n="133" who="S0282" trans="overlap">and that was too many eggs in one basket</u>
<u n="134" who="S0289">it was <trunc>an</trunc> it was a piece of wisdom we had in the early days so we should've stuck to it</u>
<u n="135" who="S0282">and we lost it yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0282">and actually it was <pause dur="short"/> we had to close that space and nobody's coming forward <pause dur="short"/> and we had we were owed</u>
<u n="138" who="S0289">I wonder what happened</u>
<u n="139" who="S0282">oh hang on a second <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> got introduced by <anon type="place"/> didn't he? by the</u>
<u n="140" who="S0289">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0282">erm by the full proof base and then <pause dur="short"/> because we got ourselves into the same issue again</u>
<u n="142" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0282"><unclear/> er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="144" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0282">erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was standing there looking like <pause dur="short"/> an angel <pause dur="short"/> well who was going to rescue us and give us all this money? <pause dur="short"/> and was stepping there and then and start paying from tomorrow? <pause dur="short"/> and we thought do we do <unclear/> today or do we do <unclear/> tomorrow? and we thought let's do <unclear/> today cos you know <unclear/> tomorrow might not be tomorrow it might be next week next month next year <pause dur="short"/> erm and because we got ourselves into a mess again we just jumped up and</u>
<u n="146" who="S0289">so those were all that we had at the beginning</u>
<u n="147" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0289">if we'd stuck to them we could've made</u>
<u n="149" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0289">the years much more comfortable</u>
<u n="151" who="S0282">yeah <pause dur="short"/> because that was the point at which he started thinking <pause dur="short"/> that <pause dur="short"/> that he should be turning <unclear/> to do not vice versa</u>
<u n="152" who="S0289">and erm <trunc>i</trunc> the main thing was at a default by one tenant</u>
<u n="153" who="S0282">yes</u>
<u n="154" who="S0289">it <unclear/> the entire project</u>
<u n="155" who="S0282">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well he started</u>
<u n="156" who="S0289" trans="overlap">had he</u>
<u n="157" who="S0282">he started <unclear>talking</unclear> to us <pause dur="short"/> he wrote to me I I <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> I'm paying for all of this and therefore I should have the right to say <pause dur="short"/> how it goes at it <pause dur="short"/> that it's never been tangible</u>
<u n="158" who="S0289">I heard that before</u>
<u n="159" who="S0282">so erm <pause dur="short"/> the</u>
<u n="160" who="S0289" trans="overlap">we set we set some interesting principles there that we should've <unclear/> to</u>
<u n="161" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> and would you say that <pause dur="short"/> you have managed to persuade <pause dur="short"/> all the other organisations at <anon type="place"/> you've worked with to take that kind of approach <pause dur="short"/> and they have been reluctant?</u>
<u n="162" who="S0289" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="163" who="S0282">what happened that they wouldn't</u>
<u n="164" who="S0289" trans="overlap">I haven't managed to persuade them because <pause dur="short"/> they all get into that moment like the enthusiastic terms <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> he says I can do this and they tend to believe him</u>
<u n="165" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0289">they don't actually do <pause dur="short"/> the thorough <unclear/></u>
<u n="167" who="S0282">actually it was true that I <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="168" who="S0289" trans="overlap">no but</u>
<u n="169" who="S0282">like an old <unclear/> because <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> no no no too good to be true and it couldn't come off that's not right that's not true <pause dur="short"/> somebody's just turned up to him and said <pause dur="short"/> we're running an employment project erm it needs to start in April they'll be paid the whole <trunc>gr</trunc> the whole year in advance in November <pause dur="short"/> probably <unclear/> space <pause dur="short"/> so they could hold it for them till November till they get their money and I'm so I told him you know what? that's not true <pause dur="short"/> he said no no she said it to me I said no er you'll find I think that that's not true oh no no no she's no she's very convinced but <pause dur="short"/> I'm sorry but I'll go for what</u>
<u n="170" who="S0289" trans="overlap">it's the second statement of the year <pause dur="short"/> and the fact the best thing you can do is <unclear/> and they turn up with the money and they've got all the right references from their bank then we'll consider them</u>
<u n="171" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="172" who="S0289">but to start considering them</u>
<u n="173" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="174" who="S0289">goes by the board when you get a hundred pressure situations</u>
<u n="175" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0289">it's easy to panic and go with something the other thing I find the churches do is they've got a very enthusiastic <pause dur="short"/> champion <pause dur="short"/> of the project <pause dur="short"/> often the picker <pause dur="short"/> who <pause dur="short"/> has seen other things succeed</u>
<u n="177" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="178" who="S0289">and is sure he can do it as well</u>
<u n="179" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="180" who="S0289">I use he <pause dur="short"/> on purpose <pause dur="short"/> he can do it as well <pause dur="short"/> erm actually he has no training and no skills to do that kind of consideration that we were looking at</u>
<u n="181" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="182" who="S0289" trans="overlap">but he leads them <pause dur="short"/> into <pause dur="short"/> chaos</u>
<u n="183" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0289">or actually I know one moment he's done it too <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> adapted the whole church or project that by the time the church opens didn't exist but nor were there any replacements</u>
<u n="185" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="186" who="S0289">like we had a list of people that we <pause dur="short"/> bettered properly before we allowed a commitment <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> it was a special needs group that a large proportion of the space <pause dur="short"/> I would say about twenty percent of the building space was adapted for their special needs</u>
<u n="187" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0289">and by the time the building had been done <pause dur="short"/> they had gone to the wind <pause dur="short"/> and so they got a special needs work area</u>
<u n="189" who="S0282">I know about that</u>
<u n="190" who="S0289">erm that there was no tenant for because</u>
<u n="191" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="192" who="S0289">there's no one else that's kind</u>
<u n="193" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="194" who="S0289">it's a bit like at the <anon type="place"/> we nearly got we had someone trying to convince us to install <pause dur="short"/> child size toilets so they could run a nursery in the crypt</u>
<u n="195" who="S0282">oh no</u>
<u n="196" who="S0289" trans="overlap">do you remember?</u>
<u n="197" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0289">and we went into the business plan to <trunc>star</trunc> er actually they got them from somewhere they got some they wanted to have fitted when we fitted the place up <pause dur="short"/> and we actually did the standard procedure at that time come back to us with your business plan <pause dur="short"/> and show us how you're gonna pay us this money they disappeared</u>
<u n="199" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="200" who="S0289">so asking people to come with their business plan and their references from their bank <pause dur="short"/> a letter saying they have the</u>
<u n="201" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="202" who="S0289">was important</u>
<u n="203" who="S0282">I think what we've done this time as well <pause dur="short"/> was <pause dur="short"/> we looked at the status of their <unclear/> vacated and thought these are derelict and nobody's gonna want them <pause dur="short"/> but how on earth can we do the math? so we went in very defensively said oh <pause dur="short"/> did pretty crap but <pause dur="short"/> you know whatever and then we discovered that actually most businesses <pause dur="short"/> fully recognise when they come in for a property</u>
<u n="204" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="205" who="S0282">they will do it up they will design it for themselves but they're erm</u>
<u n="206" who="S0289" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="207" who="S0282"><unclear/></u>
<u n="208" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="209" who="S0282">so actually they they can come in you know some <unclear/> come in <pause dur="short"/> and it will look like the worst pile of <pause dur="short"/> of of</u>
<u n="210" who="S0289">of trash yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0282" trans="overlap">of trash you've ever seen in your whole life</u>
<u n="212" who="S0289" trans="overlap">but they never use that bar anyway</u>
<u n="213" who="S0282" trans="overlap">and then they would never yeah</u>
<u n="214" who="S0289" trans="overlap">never</u>
<u n="215" who="S0282">they gonna strip out <unclear/> the whole place out get <unclear/> to get it back to the <pause dur="short"/> to the <trunc>ba</trunc></u>
<u n="216" who="S0289" trans="overlap">but do you remember we we install the bar in the crypt? <pause dur="short"/> it cost us a thousand pounds a metre</u>
<u n="217" who="S0282">oh yes of course yes of course</u>
<u n="218" who="S0289">and as soon as we got tenants <pause dur="short"/> they took it out</u>
<u n="219" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="220" who="S0289">it then ended up in the other end of the crypt for a while and then it moved upstairs for a while and it was trash</u>
<u n="221" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="222" who="S0289">and it cost that much cos the walls didn't fit it</u>
<u n="223" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="224" who="S0289" trans="overlap">it had to go down the bar</u>
<u n="225" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="226" who="S0289">but there was no need for us to do that</u>
<u n="227" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="228" who="S0289">cos once we got the restaurant in they wanted to design their own kitchen and <unclear/></u>
<u n="229" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="230" who="S0289">and everything else</u>
<u n="231" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="232" who="S0289">erm so no fitting out is not what you need to do</u>
<u n="233" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="234" who="S0289">cos they'll put their own colour paint on the wall</u>
<u n="235" who="S0282">yeah and even the school <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> came in and <unclear/> came in with that kind of paint</u>
<u n="236" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="237" who="S0282">and painted this and once they painted it white it looked utterly different <pause dur="short"/> completely transformed</u>
<u n="238" who="S0289" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="239" who="S0282">that's all it all it needed was to remove the wall back <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> erm the the control room needed a bit more work because there was I mean half of the <unclear/> we really don't know given what we found in there afterwards but <vocal desc="laugh"/> all the <unclear/> electric etcetera they've been going on there</u>
<u n="240" who="S0289" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="241" who="S0282">but erm so that you know that had to be sort of seriously stripped out but erm stripping out is the least of it really</u>
<u n="242" who="S0289">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="243" who="S0282">and in erm <pause dur="short"/> this <pause dur="short"/> erm <trunc>th</trunc>they're not supposed that the lot in <unclear/> can can actually thought about how it's gonna be paid for day to day and who's gonna</u>
<u n="244" who="S0289" trans="overlap">and part of it</u>
<u n="245" who="S0282">carry on paying the rent</u>
<u n="246" who="S0289" trans="overlap">because she <trunc>s</trunc> knows <unclear/> of that is trying to produce bigger things <pause dur="short"/> but they're not based on <pause dur="short"/> I don't know where he's getting his projected costs from in terms of utilities</u>
<u n="247" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="248" who="S0289">and things like that</u>
<u n="249" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="250" who="S0289">or <pause dur="short"/> erm I think what he does is calculate the costs and then say I need this much income</u>
<u n="251" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="252" who="S0289">but that</u>
<u n="253" who="S0282" trans="overlap">he's very interested in our</u>
<u n="254" who="S0289" trans="overlap">he's</u>
<u n="255" who="S0282">figures</u>
<u n="256" who="S0289">good what he he understands and certainly</u>
<u n="257" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="258" who="S0289"><unclear/> know that</u>
<u n="259" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="260" who="S0289">so I do think that you look back and you realise from the beginning <pause dur="short"/> I did the model for it actually which is really funny cos I wasn't into figures that much I was doing my Masters in management at the time so I began to understand it a little bit <pause dur="short"/> erm the very first cash flow projections we produced first of all on an annual basis in our budget in our business plan <pause dur="short"/> but as soon as we got nearer to running we did it on a monthly basis</u>
<u n="261" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="262" who="S0289">and we could tell when the bigger bills were gonna come in in the whole lot</u>
<u n="263" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="264" who="S0289">so we always knew where we were <pause dur="short"/> the one thing that</u>
<u n="265" who="S0282" trans="overlap">we filled in our books on that basis to this day actually</u>
<u n="266" who="S0289">and it's it would</u>
<u n="267" who="S0282" trans="overlap">what your annual accounts look is er is one thing but if you've got three months in the middle you have no money and you have loads of creditors then you're gonna go down</u>
<u n="268" who="S0289">yeah you are you are <pause dur="short"/> and so I try I've told people that at endless training events</u>
<u n="269" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="270" who="S0289">some of them you will always find someone in the attending who's worked in business enough to know why you're saying it</u>
<u n="271" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="272" who="S0289">but a lot of people <trunc>n</trunc> don't have a clue why I've said it</u>
<u n="273" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="274" who="S0289">it's a a wing and a prayer for them <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="275" who="S0282">and to this day we don't have an overdraft</u>
<u n="276" who="S0289">right good you don't need one</u>
<u n="277" who="S0282">no I know but you know</u>
<u n="278" who="S0289">it's a pain if you have one cos then it starts yeah</u>
<u n="279" who="S0282">yeah well that's just er yeah that's because they er</u>
<u n="280" who="S0289" trans="overlap">erm <pause dur="short"/> so I think I think all of that was that cash flow projection I remember all the board meetings I was in where that was er that was what controlled everything we did</u>
<u n="281" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="282" who="S0289">and it should</u>
<u n="283" who="S0282">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it does now makes my <unclear/></u>
<u n="284" who="S0289" trans="overlap">the one thing I think we didn't do we probably never got in front enough <pause dur="short"/> but some places can <anon type="place"/> I did their business plan oh and they're <trunc>f</trunc> they were following it two years later and they were doing incredibly well</u>
<u n="285" who="S0282">that's good that is good</u>
<u n="286" who="S0289" trans="overlap">erm what you need is to put into the bank enough money to hold you over when there are voids</u>
<u n="287" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="288" who="S0289">because in a building that's <pause dur="short"/> total <pause dur="short"/> you I mean you heat the whole thing or none of it</u>
<u n="289" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="290" who="S0289">that's what I mean by it's er it's a single unit in one sense although it's broken up</u>
<u n="291" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="292" who="S0289">you're still gonna have to pay the heating bill whether the people are in or not</u>
<u n="293" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="294" who="S0289">er whether the big space is filled or not</u>
<u n="295" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="296" who="S0289">all the little people still need their heat</u>
<u n="297" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="298" who="S0289">so you still need to have money in the bank to cover the average length of the void</u>
<u n="299" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="300" who="S0289">which could be six months or something</u>
<u n="301" who="S0282" trans="overlap">oh it can easily be six months by the time you <unclear/></u>
<u n="302" who="S0289"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="303" who="S0282"><unclear>that's the finished messing about</unclear></u>
<u n="304" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="305" who="S0282">I mean and we erm we did the maths recently and worked out that <pause dur="short"/> if we weren't there and only the congregation were there <pause dur="short"/> it would still cost thirty-six thousand pounds a year to run the building</u>
<u n="306" who="S0289">mm <pause dur="short"/> just to keep it open?</u>
<u n="307" who="S0282">yeah and that's without anybody actually being in any other part of the building apart from the church space</u>
<u n="308" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="309" who="S0282">because you would still need to insure the whole thing</u>
<u n="310" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="311" who="S0282">and although erm <pause dur="short"/> our friend from <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> thinks that perhaps the insurance on a church as part of the building might be <pause dur="short"/> cheaper than the insurance on the rest of it so why can't they have a discount <pause dur="short"/> on their</u>
<u n="312" who="S0289">the fact is it's er</u>
<u n="313" who="S0282" trans="overlap">contribution towards the insurance? though it's not true actually the whole building you know the whole building is insured as a whole</u>
<u n="314" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="315" who="S0282">not er space by space by space likewise electricity bill likewise <pause dur="short"/> erm lightning rod maintenance <pause dur="short"/> gas certificate electric certificates water certificate blah blah blah blah</u>
<u n="316" who="S0289" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="317" who="S0282">then you add up <pause dur="short"/> a thousand here two thousand there</u>
<u n="318" who="S0289" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="319" who="S0282">five thousand here twenty thousand for insurance whatever</u>
<u n="320" who="S0289" trans="overlap">yeah oh absolutely</u>
<u n="321" who="S0282">get up to thirty-six without blinking</u>
<u n="322" who="S0289">completely</u>
<u n="323" who="S0282">and so when erm <pause dur="short"/> people like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> think do you know what? we'll take it back and we'll run it ourselves <pause dur="short"/> they don't reckon on the fact that to stand still they have to raise thirty-six thousand</u>
<u n="324" who="S0289">yeah</u>
<u n="325" who="S0282" trans="overlap">to stand still</u>
<u n="326" who="S0289">mm <pause dur="short"/> absolutely and I do think that was that in a sense summarises what we got right we did <pause dur="short"/> do all that work on running the building</u>
<u n="327" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="328" who="S0289">before we got into detail on designing the building</u>
<u n="329" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="330" who="S0289">we made it manageable first</u>
<u n="331" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="332" who="S0289">erm <pause dur="short"/> and tested out the management plan quite well which is managing and business plan <pause dur="short"/> in one <pause dur="short"/> before we then started saying okay how would we now adapt the building? cos we had to alter all kinds of</u>
<u n="333" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="334" who="S0289">stuff on the different levels how the <trunc>stairca</trunc> <unclear/> access it and the church space that they wanted to keep</u>
<u n="335" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="336" who="S0289">which was actually a foyer</u>
<u n="337" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="338" who="S0289">had to be cut off from the staircase</u>
<u n="339" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="340" who="S0289">otherwise they were simply a throughway</u>
<u n="341" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0289">but each space had to be individually <pause dur="short"/> manageable because we needed to make it viable financially we <trunc>nee</trunc> did need to do one-off lets of an evening or a weekend we needed to do <trunc>m</trunc> the majority of the building in permanent rent</u>
<u n="343" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0289">and so getting all that manageability right then we could say to the architect we need to redo the building to <trunc>s</trunc> to do this managing structure</u>
<u n="345" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="346" who="S0289">to make this work <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and he he did</u>
<u n="347" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="348" who="S0289">erm but that's the right way round</u>
<u n="349" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0289">and he and er the architect and the quantity surveyor gave us <pause dur="short"/> a sum of what they thought <pause dur="short"/> they could do that for all modestly that would make the building manageable</u>
<u n="351" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="352" who="S0289">and we didn't get any detailed design done until we got the work we got the money done</u>
<u n="353" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="354" who="S0289">so we figured well okay that's the minimum we will now go and look for where we could find that kind of money</u>
<u n="355" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="356" who="S0289">erm and there was potential for that</u>
<u n="357" who="S0282">and then <pause dur="short"/> but I guess how many what percentage of people would you say start with an architect?</u>
<u n="358" who="S0289">ninety-eight percent</u>
<u n="359" who="S0282"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="360" who="S0289">I haven't had any response</u>
<u n="361" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="362" who="S0289">from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> at <anon type="place"/> since I sent him an e-mail saying I was working on the HLF form <pause dur="short"/> by the way was the architect appointed by competitive tender? because the HLF would require that</u>
<u n="363" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="364" who="S0289">he's never answered because I think the way the diocese operates is <pause dur="short"/> an old boy type structure</u>
<u n="365" who="S0282">I wouldn't be surprised</u>
<u n="366" who="S0289">somebody in the diocese told him this would be a good architect this would be a good <trunc>pronage</trunc> project manager</u>
<u n="367" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="368" who="S0289">and he's never they've never looked at other people</u>
<u n="369" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="370" who="S0289">and I think that <pause dur="short"/> he's probably sitting there <unclear/> cos the kind of questions I've asked him <pause dur="short"/> are <pause dur="short"/> ones he's never <unclear/> clever guy</u>
<u n="371" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="372" who="S0289">who knows a huge amount about quite a lot</u>
<u n="373" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="374" who="S0289">but he's in his comfort zone actually even though he <trunc>de</trunc>determined the project will happen but er <pause dur="short"/> there's no one he's dealing with so <pause dur="short"/> he's given me no more contacts where's that where's that <unclear/> grant thing? <pause dur="short"/> he had to go to the local authority for <pause dur="short"/> community right to bill</u>
<u n="375" who="S0282">oh yes</u>
<u n="376" who="S0289">it became clear I filled in a form and sent it through to him that he needed to find out what the local authority was doing with the community right to bill cos they had to endorse</u>
<u n="377" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="378" who="S0289">his bid</u>
<u n="379" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="380" who="S0289">and he can't act as someone in the council and basically they said to him oh no no no for goodness sake don't get us involved in that it's a nightmare</u>
<u n="381" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="382" who="S0289">so he <unclear/> me that response but <pause dur="short"/> what's he doing with it?</u>
<u n="383" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="384" who="S0289" trans="overlap">that has to be taken up locally and the council does need to be involved with it</u>
<u n="385" who="S0282">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="386" who="S0289">but erm <pause dur="short"/> they're very much on the route of starting with the architect</u>
<u n="387" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="388" who="S0289">like a nice community centre here <pause dur="short"/> and I'm absolutely all</u>
<u n="389" who="S0282" trans="overlap">they've <trunc>do</trunc>done a fantastic drawing</u>
<u n="390" who="S0289">all</u>
<u n="391" who="S0282" trans="overlap"><unclear>useful</unclear> drawing</u>
<u n="392" who="S0289" trans="overlap">all round the houses they pay a huge amount of money to be architects over <pause dur="short"/> then he was like</u>
<u n="393" who="S0282" trans="overlap">but when</u>
<u n="394" who="S0289">you know he was like but we must be able to get money from the big lottery they do community fund raising I said yes they do</u>
<u n="395" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="396" who="S0289">but us <pause dur="short"/> they will only pay up to sixty percent <vocal desc="cough"/> of the due bill community hall next month the cost of the building is half a million</u>
<u n="397" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="398" who="S0289">so he said well we we could work within that and that could be part of our Sunday I said the big lottery doesn't work like that it has to be it</u>
<u n="399" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no yeah</u>
<u n="400" who="S0289" trans="overlap">it has to be the biggest funder so that they can control how you do it</u>
<u n="401" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="402" who="S0289">they they don't play ball with what you want they'll never be a part or minor funder <pause dur="short"/> and in any case if they are just about one of the biggest where are you gonna get the other <pause dur="short"/> two and a half millions from? <pause dur="short"/> in order to take up theirs <pause dur="short"/> so he said</u>
<u n="403" who="S0282">well that's another four four funders isn't it? er er</u>
<u n="404" who="S0289">yeah and they're there but then</u>
<u n="405" who="S0282" trans="overlap">how could they <trunc>ab</trunc> nah</u>
<u n="406" who="S0289">erm <pause dur="long"/> erm I have given him the right things which he should revisit their aim and that stuff but I think he's in that thing that you were talking about he gets so down so far down the path that he spends so much money on it</u>
<u n="407" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="408" who="S0289">that you can't back track and say let's start the design again</u>
<u n="409" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="410" who="S0289">he theoretically has said to me <pause dur="short"/> well if we can't raise the money <pause dur="short"/> why don't we look at the design and go for something more modest? we could go for a single storey for that <pause dur="short"/> and I'm fine I think he might be need to do that and if he doesn't hear back cos</u>
<u n="411" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="412" who="S0289" trans="overlap">he might not <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> I think the the business part I think it's <unclear/> has potential</u>
<u n="413" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="414" who="S0289">and one <unclear/> nearer and nearer <pause dur="short"/> but he won't do it without he won't get the gas works section done in six without <pause dur="short"/> the council feeling they're achieving it</u>
<u n="415" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="416" who="S0289">so it's it's it's working with the council <pause dur="short"/> working with business leaders so that they do a <trunc>l</trunc> it's exactly like <anon type="place"/> exactly</u>
<u n="417" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="419" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="420" who="S0289">erm <pause dur="short"/> but is that relationship which</u>
<u n="421" who="S0282" trans="overlap">but actually what's dangerous what's worrying about it is the building is so much smaller I doubt that you can have more than one thing happening in there at a time one or two things happening in there at at a time and that means that those things have got to</u>
<u n="422" who="S0289" trans="overlap">well that means essentially <unclear/> café</u>
<u n="423" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="424" who="S0289">on the plan <pause dur="short"/> but they don't know what kind of café</u>
<u n="425" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="426" who="S0289">erm <pause dur="short"/> like I said all it what would excel? <pause dur="short"/> er what kind of food is it like the restaurant or will you just be taking their <pause dur="short"/> customers from it?</u>
<u n="427" who="S0282">in which case immediate drop <unclear/> from your local business community?</u>

<u n="429" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="430" who="S0289" trans="overlap">no that's not where we were with the <anon type="place"/> we had tested all those things out and I think <pause dur="short"/> to go fundraising for them you actually have to ask <pause dur="short"/> for those things to be tested out</u>
<u n="431" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="432" who="S0289">and then the design will only valid in the context that but he's already started asking that <pause dur="short"/> architect to take the design forward <pause dur="short"/> to the next stage</u>
<u n="433" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="434" who="S0289">which is <pause dur="short"/> I'm thinking still that he should still be in the <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> let's think about whether this</u>
<u n="435" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="436" who="S0289">is the community audit which is entirely missing from there which is</u>

<u n="444" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="445" who="S0282">it could be peaceful and and you know on the day they're opening people will flock towards it and they'd take it to their hearts <pause dur="short"/> and immediately become utterly well used by everybody who'd be queuing up to <unclear/></u>
<u n="446" who="S0289" trans="overlap">just occasionally that happened</u>
<u n="447" who="S0282">yeah</u>

<u n="449" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="450" who="S0289">a lot of the projects they want in there <pause dur="short"/> are probably entirely the right ones</u>
<u n="451" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="452" who="S0289" trans="overlap">but they need to go and see the projects that's why I said to them well how are you gonna run these things how are we gonna know? we'll have organisation <unclear/> come in and pay for the space</u>
<u n="453" who="S0282">that's sensible</u>
<u n="454" who="S0289">well who are they?</u>
<u n="455" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="456" who="S0289">where's their letter saying they want this space</u>

<u n="482" who="S0289">they were allowed only because they had so many doors to be outside there wasn't really much internal space really three hundred <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> it's no good designing the space for those three hundred when actually most days they only had twenty-five</u>
<u n="483" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="484" who="S0289">you need to do space to be able to work mostly for twenty-five with</u>

<u n="486" who="S0289">the occasional squash</u>
<u n="487" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="488" who="S0289">so churches then say oh we have four hundred people sometimes <pause dur="short"/> well actually it's once a year</u>

<u n="493" who="S0282">oh right</u>
<u n="494" who="S0289">so all the army service is oriented so everyone turns up <pause dur="short"/> so you don't design anything to service four hundred people or</u>
<u n="495" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="496" who="S0289"><unclear/> when the four hundred people are there you design for what you normally have</u>
<u n="497" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="498" who="S0289">and you know the churches on that same basis would say to me we've got to have a kitchen we've got to be able to cook here</u>
<u n="499" who="S0282">oh</u>
<u n="500" who="S0289">and then it turns out when you er that eighty thousand pounds was supposed to have servery for about fifteen thousand</u>

<u n="508" who="S0289">well do you want to pay eighty-five thousand pounds for a kitchen that gets used once a year? or do you order fish and chips service?</u>
<u n="509" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="510" who="S0289">or do you do something well we don't like carrying food in well eighty-five thousand is a lot of money</u>

<u n="512" who="S0289">you could buy caterers a lot of times over</u>

<u n="519" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="520" who="S0289">to construct a servery but once they've got it <trunc>i</trunc>it's always enough</u>
<u n="521" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="522" who="S0289">erm there is one church I've been working with that erm <pause dur="short"/> had determined they had to have a kitchen <pause dur="short"/> because they want to have a project for the homeless</u>
<u n="523" who="S0282">yup</u>
<u n="524" who="S0289">er serving lunch every day</u>
<u n="525" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="526" who="S0289">every weekday</u>
<u n="527" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="528" who="S0289">er at you know community rate and so I know they <unclear/> pressed the numbers they have a legacy so they've got lots of money which is a dreadful shame <pause dur="short"/> and a couple of them were really really really pushing that they had to have a kitchen to do the cooking in so I said I it's not my decision whether you have a kitchen or not but it seemed to be an enormous amount of money to spend that you ought to justify to yourself</u>
<u n="529" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="530" who="S0289">oh but it's our mission <pause dur="short"/> so I said that's fine <pause dur="short"/> I think you need to do several things one of them is go to all the homeless projects in the town <pause dur="short"/> and check out with each of them if there is a <pause dur="short"/> gap between demand and</u>
<u n="531" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="532" who="S0289">supply</u>
<u n="533" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="534" who="S0289">in other words er do you really need another homeless project? I know you'd like it and you want to be doing something</u>
<u n="535" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="536" who="S0289">for people who are really poor but are there any really poor who are gonna turn up?</u>
<u n="537" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="538" who="S0289">are you going to install this kitchen and finally you get one or two people once a week? <pause dur="short"/> and they they wouldn't do it they wouldn't do it <pause dur="short"/> they did never did the homework erm two of the people on the group very much wanted to the vicar wouldn't back them even though he knew what'd been said was totally sensible cos his wife was one of the others who were we've got to have a mission to the homeless people</u>
<u n="539" who="S0282">ah</u>
<u n="540" who="S0289">and along with another person who I can't <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> a bit mad <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="541" who="S0282">you haven't said enough to me who know <trunc>w</trunc>who these people they could be anywhere in England</u>
<u n="542" who="S0289" trans="overlap">they could be anywhere in England that's</u>

<u n="544" who="S0289" trans="overlap">they could be out of England couldn't they? <pause dur="short"/> erm but anyway because they got their own money they went on and had a kitchen both</u>
<u n="545" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="546" who="S0289">being built at the moment <pause dur="short"/> and it was it's a bit of foolishness because they've only got about twenty-five or thirty people in the church <pause dur="short"/> they've got a number of pensioners who use are using it all voluntarily and it it just to keep the church going</u>
<u n="547" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="548" who="S0289">who are not interested in turning up to <trunc>ba</trunc> make lunches every day</u>
<u n="549" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="550" who="S0289">and they've not talked about how they're gonna get the money for the food and the ingredients and who's gonna be the manager and do the shopping and all that it's all pie in the sky</u>
<u n="551" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="552" who="S0289">and they expect <pause dur="short"/> eighty thousand more than they need to to</u>
<u n="553" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="554" who="S0289">have a servery</u>
<u n="555" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="556" who="S0289">so</u>
<u n="557" who="S0282" trans="overlap">and actually they're <unclear/></u>
<u n="558" who="S0289">well that's</u>
<u n="559" who="S0282" trans="overlap">because actually doing that with volunteers</u>
<u n="560" who="S0289">you can't do it</u>
<u n="561" who="S0282">you can't do it</u>
<u n="562" who="S0289">in charge of the safety of the volunteers you need an expert in</u>
<u n="563" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="564" who="S0289">controlling homeless people</u>
<u n="565" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="566" who="S0289">so again it's a kind of thing that <pause dur="short"/> where is your market?</u>
<u n="567" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="568" who="S0289">how are you gonna serve your market? how is it manageable?</u>
<u n="569" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="570" who="S0289">is it really there? and I don't think there was one for them I never saw</u>
<u n="571" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="572" who="S0289">a single <trunc>ho</trunc> single homeless person malingering around the church where I was going quite a lot of <unclear/> period of time</u>
<u n="573" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="574" who="S0289">well that was an issue <pause dur="short"/> I think you would've seen quite a lot</u>
<u n="575" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="576" who="S0289" trans="overlap">I'm sure if you are there all the time you see some</u>
<u n="577" who="S0282">but then you've got to be careful as well because I mean round you know It's <unclear/> around that building you know there was a guy lying <unclear/> on the grass in the church yard having had a whole thing full of <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> probably and was as they went up tenants and asked him if he was alright to see if he was dead or alive turned up he was alive but he claimed the case and stuff like that erm what and you get a lot of in the church yard but you've got you've also then you've got to have something you <unclear/> to say couldn't do <unclear/> there's no point in you opening the doors in your inner <unclear/> and letting six heroin addicts walk in and sit down I mean <pause dur="short"/> people <unclear/> complain to people you know there's been a chair of trustees plus the manager who couldn't tell because <pause dur="short"/> they had homeless people on their premises and they didn't stop them taking drugs</u>
<u n="578" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="579" who="S0282">and they weren't allowing them to take drugs and they weren't encouraging them to take drugs but they weren't actually <unclear/></u>
<u n="580" who="S0289" trans="overlap">they turned a blind eye</u>
<u n="581" who="S0282">them to take some drugs and they both went to jail and I say and people go ho ho ho <unclear/> exaggeration you think er no <trunc>e</trunc> you you know this is a <unclear/> every time er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> lets somebody in to use the toilet or to have a cup of tea they still <unclear/></u>
<u n="582" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="583" who="S0282">fortunately the <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> you know theft caused by someone being an idiot <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> so he actually got his money back <trunc>th</trunc>the <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> cos he sort of ran <unclear/> and left something in the toilet and didn't come back and check for a while erm you know and fortunately <unclear/> but other <unclear/> pocket</u>
<u n="584" who="S0289">yeah</u>
<u n="585" who="S0282">but you know but er you know <unclear/> they do let people in premises to get a cup of tea or whatever but you can't have somebody there you and you cannot leave a bunch of volunteers to supervise people who've got fundamental issues like heroin addiction and they're on the street</u>
<u n="586" who="S0289" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="587" who="S0282">or they're taking drugs out in the open and then falling coma <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> you know where they</u>

<u n="594" who="S0289">yeah it's it's all of that stuff that people need to understand</u>
<u n="595" who="S0282">and also how they're going to pay for example I mean this is a thing that what we have to we have to talk over and over again haven't we? <pause dur="short"/> you've got to have <unclear/> or you can you've got to have some clients or some tenants who've got the money to pay something because you can't accept er quid pro quo you can't accept everybody's paying <unclear/> even people that you suspected and thought to pay more <unclear/> and try and drive down to ludicrous levels</u>
<u n="596" who="S0289" trans="overlap">what do you think about <pause dur="short"/> a group that has twenty-five adults in it?</u>
<u n="597" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="598" who="S0289">those people are probably spending five pounds a day on alcohol and five pounds a day on cigarettes</u>
<u n="599" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="600" who="S0289">and let alone the drugs <pause dur="short"/> that are around various kinds <pause dur="short"/> so those people if they went to their pubs for their evening out would spend the minimum <pause dur="short"/> ten or fifteen pounds</u>
<u n="601" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="602" who="S0289">so when they come to do an activity in your building <pause dur="short"/> they can afford to spend ten or fifteen pounds on the activity</u>
<u n="603" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="604" who="S0289">per person</u>
<u n="605" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="606" who="S0289">and so multiple that by your twenty-five people <pause dur="short"/> and you've got quite a lot of money</u>
<u n="607" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="608" who="S0289">and they still have a mindset of you've got to do things really cheap or give them away if you're a church</u>
<u n="609" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="610" who="S0289">and that's not true</u>
<u n="611" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="612" who="S0289">you've got to be able to make the hard decisions</u>
<u n="613" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="614" who="S0289">erm <pause dur="short"/> some people some churches I work with will understand that</u>

<u n="616" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="617" who="S0282">and then I had this man who came and see me who who argued that I couldn't really be a charity because we were all all earning our own money <pause dur="short"/> and charities don't earn money which must mean that we're project we must be a private company we can't be a charity because we're earning our own money that's to say erm <pause dur="short"/> but then you've got to set a</u>

<u n="622" who="S0289">do you remember who was setting up the structure for <anon type="place"/>? <pause dur="short"/> I was absolutely determined I don't know how many of this is true I just think it's common sense I've been around the church but we <pause dur="short"/> we needed to have a group who were <pause dur="short"/> guiding <pause dur="short"/> officers <pause dur="short"/> body</u>
<u n="623" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="624" who="S0289">that would make the hard decisions like if someone's not paying the rent we throw them out</u>
<u n="625" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="626" who="S0289">because all of those people depend on coming to some kind <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> who can't bear to have a bad name in the community and so <pause dur="short"/> if you were really Christian you wouldn't let me off</u>
<u n="627" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="628" who="S0289">erm <pause dur="short"/> what's Christian about letting you off what you committed yourself to pay? if you were a Christian you'd pay what you agreed</u>
<u n="629" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="630" who="S0289">you'd keep to your contract</u>
<u n="631" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="632" who="S0289">if you didn't like the rent when you started why didn't you talk to us about it then?</u>
<u n="633" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="634" who="S0289">but we've made a commitment to switch the heating on because you'd said you'd pay your rent erm and you've used that heating <pause dur="short"/> erm so where's <trunc>th</trunc> where's a Christian issue from our point of view because we'll let you off?</u>
<u n="635" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="636" who="S0289">when you haven't kept your commitment you know all that stuff but you know that's why when we I said we must have a group running it structured so that they could make the hard decisions I said people with teeth</u>
<u n="637" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="638" who="S0289" trans="overlap">they're crocodiles</u>
<u n="639" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="640" who="S0289">people with teeth who could bite the bullet and say I'm sorry no</u>
<u n="641" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="642" who="S0289">and it didn't come back <trunc>th</trunc>the vicar was supposed to be the nice guy and tried to <pause dur="short"/> be both sides at the same time</u>
<u n="643" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="644" who="S0289">so you have to have a final decision made by someone who hasn't whose job wasn't about being <unclear>timely</unclear></u>
<u n="645" who="S0282">but that's really difficult I mean I still I get fed up of someone looking at me and thinking you know what you're a <unclear/></u>
<u n="646" who="S0289">mm</u>
<u n="647" who="S0282">and they're the ones who are on the board <pause dur="short"/> and you're actually thinking <unclear/> terribly where I <pause dur="short"/> by the fact that somebody's not paying us</u>
<u n="648" who="S0289">at least in the beginning <pause dur="short"/> at least it's <trunc>o</trunc> it's one of the difficulties is <pause dur="short"/> both members are <unclear/> to change over the years <pause dur="short"/> and their reasons for joining might be various</u>
<u n="649" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="650" who="S0289">but you need the right <pause dur="short"/> mix</u>
<u n="651" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="652" who="S0289">and at the beginning we certainly do get enough people but we <unclear/> to make sure they understood the business of what</u>
<u n="653" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="654" who="S0289">we're trying to do</u>
<u n="655" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="656" who="S0289">but if the business of what we're trying to do failed then the whole building failed and</u>
<u n="657" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="658" who="S0289">the church would be gone as well</u>
<u n="659" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="660" who="S0289">erm</u>
<u n="661" who="S0282">well actually what was quite interesting there was somebody as well <pause dur="short"/> it's we were trying to do various things and move on and do extra <unclear/> and <pause dur="short"/> erm the council for example wants to know about the board</u>
<u n="662" who="S0289">aha</u>
<u n="663" who="S0282">and wants to know how many of us are <anon type="place"/> residents and how many of us are from different ethnic groups and our ages and our gender and stuff like that <pause dur="short"/> erm they're and they are interested that <unclear/> should should <unclear>bid</unclear> a particular demographic <pause dur="short"/> profile or whatever especially living in <anon type="place"/> without reference to the fact that can we run <pause dur="short"/> can we run a business <pause dur="short"/> within us you know all we're saying is that we want to run an asset <pause dur="short"/> and they're not asking us about what our businesses groups are and who we've got on the board they're interested in how erm in how many people I've got or how many people I've got who are disabled or whatever and they've sort of been actually <pause dur="short"/> it is difficult cos we've never and <unclear/> to kind of quantify our social value I mean we've never had to do that before because <pause dur="short"/> we've never had a grant we've never gone down that route we've never been so useful so I mean <unclear/> to say well you know we've got to wash our face we've got to know this we've always got to earn more than we spend because otherwise the</u>

<u n="665" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="666" who="S0289">mm <pause dur="short"/> I do think that that er that er I've tried to stay out of that game on</u>
<u n="667" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="668" who="S0289">and I tried to teach churches for example again we were doing it when we set up <anon type="place"/> we would not have a board that was made up of representatives of the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> group</u>
<u n="669" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="670" who="S0289">because they've done that before and it failed because each of the <unclear/></u>
<u n="671" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="672" who="S0289">had the best in interest to not allowing</u>

<u n="677" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="678" who="S0289">you've got to have a board that does it on the basis of the umbrella</u>

<u n="686" who="S0289">erm <pause dur="short"/> in fact you could just play a funny game with numbers you only have <pause dur="short"/> two numbers <pause dur="short"/> at the collective <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="687" who="S0282">mm</u>

<u n="694" who="S0289">er which was fundamentally the structure we started with</u>
<u n="695" who="S0282">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said to me the other day <pause dur="short"/> he said to us oh <unclear/>?</u>

<u n="699" who="S0282">oh no you can just carry on and <unclear/> no oh <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> so it's obviously <vocal desc="laugh"/> there's obviously something behind the question</u>
<u n="700" who="S0289">well he he</u>
<u n="701" who="S0282" trans="overlap">but yeah</u>
<u n="702" who="S0289">structured the only one he knows is the broker church council structure</u>
<u n="703" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="704" who="S0289">which should be rubbish for running this kind of thing and</u>
<u n="705" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="706" who="S0289">I'm trying to explain that to people that if you stay in the <pause dur="short"/> under the PCC certain amount as a subcommittee of the PCC with its own terms of reference that allows you</u>
<u n="707" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="708" who="S0289">not to be re-elected every year that allows you to <unclear/> with skills <pause dur="short"/> and so on because it's the only way you could stay <unclear/> you cannot have new trustees once a year and expect</u>

<u n="710" who="S0289">to <trunc>conti</trunc>continue to make good decisions about</u>

<u n="712" who="S0289">that have to be based <pause dur="short"/> on being financially viable</u>
<u n="713" who="S0282">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's been quite difficult with some of those people <pause dur="short"/> the board anyway</u>
<u n="714" who="S0289">I know</u>
<u n="715" who="S0282" trans="overlap">get <unclear/> what do you think? and they said oh no <vocal desc="laugh"/> how could we come up with that solution? oh it's him oh him again <vocal desc="laugh"/> him again with his <unclear/> decision-making erm</u>
<u n="716" who="S0289">but it it was <pause dur="short"/> that was <trunc>e</trunc>exactly why we set up that complicated thing at the beginning that <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> meant that there were two shares in the company</u>
<u n="717" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="718" who="S0289"><unclear/> because we knew that the PCC <pause dur="short"/> was unreliable</u>
<u n="719" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="720" who="S0289">and in a sense we couldn't trust the dioceses <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> to not pull the programme down because they got fed up with the hassle</u>
<u n="721" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="722" who="S0289">cos it was hassle</u>
<u n="723" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="724" who="S0289"><anon type="place"/> was a major nightmare they would've loved to have been out of it but they did because it was <anon type="place"/> and the public image they would've got to have</u>
<u n="725" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="726" who="S0289">closed the major church in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="727" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="728" who="S0289">etcetera so if you gave each of them a share neither of them could <unclear/> the other they had to agree on the way forward and I thought that in the basis of our business planning <pause dur="short"/> and having a <pause dur="short"/> council of trustees who <pause dur="short"/> were making the hard decisions <pause dur="short"/> that the dioceses for the <unclear/> future would back it</u>
<u n="729" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="730" who="S0289" trans="overlap">cos at the moment the dioceses from that structured point of view is more reliable than the <pause dur="short"/> parish</u>
<u n="731" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="732" who="S0289">but there could come a point in the future when the diocese says we actually think we're gonna take this building over we've got the right to <unclear/> we're gonna turn it into the diocese's office</u>
<u n="733" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="734" who="S0289">and er that would be a good idea <pause dur="short"/> er the PCC could say no</u>
<u n="735" who="S0282">well I mean if <unclear/> that would be fine if they wanted to if they wanted to do that unless they you know <unclear/> preserve the building</u>
<u n="736" who="S0289">yeah for the people in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="737" who="S0282">yeah and</u>
<u n="738" who="S0289">actual interpretation and</u>
<u n="739" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="740" who="S0289" trans="overlap">they would be a good tenant but they can come from <anon type="place"/> in fact they would never do it because the staff wouldn't go to work in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="741" who="S0282">they might just change it <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> but and actually what is <pause dur="short"/> er what is extraordinary is that the two businesses are two keeping businesses now <pause dur="short"/> their client group <pause dur="short"/> are really posh white young people</u>
<u n="742" who="S0289" trans="overlap">oh really?</u>
<u n="743" who="S0282">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>rea</trunc> you know</u>
<u n="744" who="S0289"><anon type="place"/> <anon type="place"/> <unclear/> cos then had to do it for my when I did my Masters <pause dur="short"/> erm in turns of what makes this <pause dur="short"/> a a successful redevelopment</u>
<u n="745" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="746" who="S0289">you know on the regeneration bit how what kind are there places you can't be generated</u>
<u n="747" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="748" who="S0289">and that which ones are really susceptible to regeneration</u>
<u n="749" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="750" who="S0289">where <anon type="place"/> fitted the susceptible to regeneration because it had a mixture of <pause dur="short"/> social grouping social classes <unclear/></u>
<u n="751" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="752" who="S0289">success in the past</u>
<u n="753" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="754" who="S0289">but ones that don't work are the things like the <anon type="place"/> or <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="755" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="756" who="S0289" trans="overlap">where they'd never be <pause dur="short"/> a a viable community</u>
<u n="757" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="758" who="S0289">it's always been a <unclear/> and you replaced it with small housing that would become hatches for people that had no money to get outside them</u>
<u n="759" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="760" who="S0289" trans="overlap">and all that stuff if you're gonna have a mix <pause dur="short"/> a really mixed community of all kinds then erm</u>
<u n="761" who="S0282">and probably a mixed <unclear/> house in that case as well <trunc>th</trunc>they</u>
<u n="762" who="S0289" trans="overlap">yeah well and er er</u>
<u n="763" who="S0282" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="764" who="S0289" trans="overlap">but when they redeveloped <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> erm they actually put in a mixture of housing</u>
<u n="765" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="766" who="S0289">and only a proportion of it was welfare and a a a lot of <pause dur="short"/> stark homes to buy and plus some big big private <unclear/> so that they would always have a mix there in the future</u>
<u n="767" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="768" who="S0289">and it it it was a chance <trunc>the</trunc>they had a chance to get something started which could last erm it will take a long time to establish but it you know</u>
<u n="769" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="770" who="S0289">and <anon type="place"/>'s got it built into its fabric</u>

<u n="841" who="S0282"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="842" who="S0289">and it got to the interval <pause dur="short"/> and erm <pause dur="short"/> we went to the bar <pause dur="short"/> and got ourselves a drink <pause dur="short"/> we were the only ones in the bar <pause dur="short"/> and I said to the person I was with I really don't know if I can face going back in but <pause dur="short"/> I I feel bad for <unclear/> of any audience <pause dur="short"/> and the guy behind the bar says well if the <unclear/> last this long nobody else would</u>
<u n="843" who="S0282"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="844" who="S0289">and what it turned out was</u>
<u n="845" who="S0282">oh my word</u>
<u n="846" who="S0289" trans="overlap">it was one of those typical <anon type="place"/> type of thing cos I know <unclear/> <anon type="place"/> the girl in the play <pause dur="short"/> albina Alba or whatever her name was <pause dur="short"/> her father she convinced him to pay</u>
<u n="847" who="S0282">wow</u>

<u n="849" who="S0282">oh right</u>
<u n="850" who="S0289" trans="overlap">no <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="851" who="S0282">oh</u>
<u n="852" who="S0289" trans="overlap"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="853" who="S0282">oh</u>
<u n="854" who="S0289">in <anon type="place"/> cos <anon type="place"/> wasn't going quite so strongly then and erm <pause dur="short"/> had taken it on <pause dur="short"/> and it never worked</u>
<u n="855" who="S0282">no of course</u>
<u n="856" who="S0289" trans="overlap">cos</u>
<u n="857" who="S0282">actually that was probably the one who came to tried to take the space the other year</u>
<u n="858" who="S0289">probably was</u>
<u n="859" who="S0282">and who runs a small phone company or <trunc>s</trunc> <unclear/> company and <trunc>h</trunc>he was setting her up with her own acting school</u>
<u n="860" who="S0289">it could've been easy almost identical if it's not the space but how could a father do it twice I can't imagine</u>
<u n="861" who="S0282" trans="overlap">well he didn't in the end cos he wanted to rent he wanted the rent he wanted <unclear/> period which he wasn't given <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="862" who="S0289" trans="overlap">wow <pause dur="short"/> absolutely <trunc>ba</trunc></u>
<u n="863" who="S0282" trans="overlap">you know <trunc>i</trunc>it's a vanity project I mean you can pay for it and I don't know how many vanity projects might've spent <unclear/></u>
<u n="864" who="S0289" trans="overlap">well absolutely</u>
<u n="865" who="S0282">and then with the <unclear/> once it's all over it's a huge disaster after it months you just all walk out of the building and the</u>
<u n="866" who="S0289" trans="overlap">and having paid no money</u>
<u n="867" who="S0282">and having paid no money after eighteen your eighteen month experiment to our expense <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="868" who="S0289" trans="overlap">I did find that there were on one community premises the church was <pause dur="short"/> nearly manipulated into letting it happen <pause dur="short"/> the group wanted to move in <pause dur="short"/> and they were totally grant funded</u>
<u n="869" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="870" who="S0289">and they wanted erm a rent free period in return for having fitted the place out <pause dur="short"/> and I said to the <pause dur="short"/> church why would you let that happen? oh they're so nice</u>
<u n="871" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="872" who="S0289">blah blah blah</u>
<u n="873" who="S0282">and they set the place out</u>
<u n="874" who="S0289" trans="overlap">well absolutely and I said but it's not their money they haven't not a single penny of the organisation's money has been spent on anything like that that was entirely grant money it's entirely someone else's so it's not their money and they're now out of pocket <pause dur="short"/> it's entirely separate</u>
<u n="875" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="876" who="S0289">cos their granny or somebody did it do you see what I mean? <pause dur="short"/> so there's absolutely no justification for a rent free period</u>
<u n="877" who="S0282"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="878" who="S0289"><trunc>i</trunc><trunc>i</trunc>it's a silly sentimental</u>
<u n="879" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="880" who="S0289">er unthinking</u>

<u n="882" who="S0289">nonsense</u>
<u n="883" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="884" who="S0289">absolute nonsense</u>
<u n="885" who="S0282">but it's also been taken by people actually it's also believing</u>
<u n="886" who="S0289" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="887" who="S0282">whatever <unclear/> people want to give you when they turn up</u>
<u n="888" who="S0289">oh absolutely</u>
<u n="889" who="S0282">and taking absolutely a face value and</u>
<u n="890" who="S0289">yeah</u>
<u n="891" who="S0282">and thinking and actually it's taken me a long time to work out how people actually just lie to your face</u>
<u n="892" who="S0289">well <trunc>i</trunc> yeah they will lie to your face <pause dur="short"/> they will particularly tell you exactly what they think you need to hear in order to</u>
<u n="893" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="894" who="S0289">push the button</u>
<u n="895" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="896" who="S0289">and <trunc>th</trunc>that was erm <pause dur="short"/> a certain ethnic group <pause dur="short"/> were more liable to do that than others</u>
<u n="897" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="898" who="S0289" trans="overlap">when in the groups</u>
<u n="899" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="900" who="S0289">erm simply because that's the culture in their where they came from</u>
<u n="901" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="902" who="S0289">who er I've been mentioning their name</u>
<u n="903" who="S0282"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/> turn up <pause dur="short"/> we were very much enclosed to that kind of give a home to this <unclear/> club and then <trunc>i</trunc>it well it came off and then <pause dur="short"/> then <unclear/> afterwards</u>
<u n="904" who="S0289">yeah <pause dur="short"/> everyone</u>
<u n="905" who="S0282" trans="overlap">but that was asking you know it was like yeah you know all the actresses are really good I know you need to see this and this and</u>
<u n="906" who="S0289" trans="overlap">they promote people cos they can't do the job to <unclear/> department so you give people good references when you have <unclear/></u>
<u n="907" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="908" who="S0289">so that you can get rid of them</u>
<u n="909" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="910" who="S0289" trans="overlap">it happens in <pause dur="short"/> governments</u>
<u n="911" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="912" who="S0289">I mean in local governments and all that</u>
<u n="913" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="914" who="S0289">because it's very difficult to get rid of people on the grounds they're incompetent</u>
<u n="915" who="S0282">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> so what else would you say?</u>
<u n="916" who="S0289">okay so I think that's the first thing is to get your</u>
<u n="917" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="918" who="S0289">your sustainability plan right</u>
<u n="919" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="920" who="S0289">your management your business planning your financial strategy and then all the things like</u>
<u n="921" who="S0282" trans="overlap">just to <unclear/></u>
<u n="922" who="S0289">your letting rent and everything have to work to that</u>
<u n="923" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="924" who="S0289">erm and then you have to test out your potential users</u>
<u n="925" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="926" who="S0289" trans="overlap">if you're going to have anyone there all the time</u>
<u n="927" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="928" who="S0289">if it just regular lettings then you never let anyone come in until they've paid their fee</u>
<u n="929" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="930" who="S0289" trans="overlap">or you take a big enough deposit from them that they only get back if they've got all of that stuff you safeguard yourself when you do it</u>
<u n="931" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="932" who="S0289">I think the second step is <pause dur="short"/> I was just about to tell you because we were having this conversation about formulating what I thought by writing a comment at the Church Times</u>
<u n="933" who="S0282">aha</u>
<u n="934" who="S0289">saying there the second thing I think you do is to <pause dur="short"/> mosey around research all the potential <trunc>s</trunc>sources of the kind of capital funding that you need in order to make this happen</u>
<u n="935" who="S0282" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="936" who="S0289">including your own resources</u>
<u n="937" who="S0282">aha</u>
<u n="938" who="S0289">so I think once you determine what is actually needed and</u>
<u n="939" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="940" who="S0289">how much of it and how you could do it in a way that is sustainable</u>
<u n="941" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="942" who="S0289">so that's your market research really</u>
<u n="943" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="944" who="S0289">or local audit in the charity <unclear>sect</unclear> but it is market research</u>
<u n="945" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="946" who="S0289">your second step is to find out where you are going to what is a realistic amount of capital</u>
<u n="947" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="948" who="S0289">that you could raise to <pause dur="short"/> adapt your building</u>
<u n="949" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="950" who="S0289">to change</u>
<u n="951" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="952" who="S0289">and that means reading thoroughly through the lottery sources</u>
<u n="953" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="954" who="S0289" trans="overlap">again it is something that the <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> people do need to do so that they understand why I'm saying that it's unrealistic</u>
<u n="955" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="956" who="S0289">er <pause dur="short"/> I like them so much this this circle and I love I love being there but <pause dur="short"/> I needed to be there more often</u>
<u n="957" who="S0282">well yeah</u>
<u n="958" who="S0289">but then</u>
