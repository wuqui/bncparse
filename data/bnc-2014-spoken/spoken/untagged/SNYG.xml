<u n="172" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0008">yeah</u>

<u n="175" who="S0008" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> well my mother worked out hers through her mother <pause dur="short"/> no it wasn't it was through her her father</u>
<u n="176" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="177" who="S0008">and erm she worked it out you know right back to I think it's something like sixteen eighty ain't it? when the parish records first began</u>
<u n="178" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="179" who="S0008">and you know to get back past that it's quite difficult unless you are related to some</u>
<u n="180" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0008"><trunc>ar</trunc> <vocal desc="cough"/> aristocracy you can</u>
<u n="182" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah lords or ladies or whatever</u>
<u n="183" who="S0008">who who erm kept records and</u>
<u n="184" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="185" who="S0008">of course when they sold land or passed land down</u>
<u n="186" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="187" who="S0008">you could go down through the wills</u>
<u n="188" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="189" who="S0008">you know cos er they all had to have wills and these little documents</u>
<u n="190" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="191" who="S0012"><unclear/></u>
<u n="192" who="S0008">so you can go back past this sort of this cut of point of <trunc>whatev</trunc> whenever it is</u>
<u n="193" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="194" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="195" who="S0008">but it's much more difficult</u>
<u n="196" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="197" who="S0008">and like when you consider most people don't come from the aristocracy anyway</u>
<u n="198" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="199" who="S0008">well so they're saying most people are related to everyone else anyway aren't they?</u>
<u n="200" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="201" who="S0008">cos they reckon if you go back far enough you're related to everybody</u>
<u n="202" who="S0012">well there's supposed to have only been two families in this in this whole world and</u>
<u n="203" who="S0008">mm well that's you know one theory but that's been changed recently</u>
<u n="204" who="S0012">that's been changed has it?</u>
<u n="205" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="206" who="S0012">oh well they decided it was two families</u>
<u n="207" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="208" who="S0012">one from Africa and one from Europe</u>
<u n="209" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="210" who="S0012">and that was it <pause dur="short"/> but it does make you wonder</u>
<u n="211" who="S0008">mm <pause dur="short"/> well you know it could be right I mean like if you think about a tribe as a family</u>
<u n="212" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="213" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="214" who="S0008">but they're finding out more and more about <unclear/></u>
<u n="215" who="S0013">mm yeah</u>
<u n="216" who="S0012" trans="overlap">but there can't have been two <pause dur="short"/> I mean otherwise you wouldn't get</u>
<u n="217" who="S0013">be more than that</u>
<u n="218" who="S0012">the diversity of looks would you? I mean your Chinese and and er Japanese</u>
<u n="219" who="S0008" trans="overlap">yeah well the Chinese the latest theory is is that the you know they all reckon that there was a migration out of Africa <pause dur="short"/> dunno how long ago <pause dur="short"/> how many thousands of years ago <pause dur="short"/> tens of thousands <pause dur="short"/> they always reckoned there was one which sort of came up through the Middle East <pause dur="short"/> branched off there then went up through Europe and then came er into Europe</u>
<u n="220" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="221" who="S0008">but already in Europe was Neanderthal</u>
<u n="222" who="S0012">yeah</u>

<u n="224" who="S0012">yeah that's right yeah</u>
<u n="225" who="S0008"><vocal desc="cough"/> and also they found out they'd there was not only Neanderthal people there was this other type of people as well in Asia well no in in <pause dur="short"/> well I suppose it is Asia</u>
<u n="226" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="227" who="S0008">but sort of North Asia</u>
<u n="228" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="229" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="230" who="S0008">that sort of area and they were the Denisovans</u>

<u n="232" who="S0008">right? who were?</u>
<u n="233" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="234" who="S0008">this other sorta offshoot of Neanderthal Denisovans <pause dur="short"/> and then you got modern man sorta came up and slowly these other two branches sorta died out <pause dur="short"/> but on the other hand they reckon there was a lot of interbreeding going on between em anyway</u>
<u n="235" who="S0012">there must've been mustn't there?</u>
<u n="236" who="S0008">cos they were very sorta similar types</u>

<u n="238" who="S0008">they were a very sorta similar type of</u>
<u n="239" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="240" who="S0008">people but but now they're saying that something like half a million years before that there was this other branch of people came out of Africa which is also modern man which then went up round the coast of Asia India China through the the straits you know all the</u>
<u n="241" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="242" who="S0008">all the islands <pause dur="short"/> and that branch then got intermingled with the modern people and they're sort of like still there you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="243" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="244" who="S0008">it's you know I mean</u>
<u n="245" who="S0012">well they said that the <trunc>Inui</trunc></u>
<u n="246" who="S0008">when they talk about people coming out of Africa they aren't talking about like one bloke?</u>

<u n="248" who="S0008">with his wife you know what I mean?</u>

<u n="255" who="S0008">time span of hundreds if not thousands of years</u>
<u n="256" who="S0012">cos they've thought the Inuits</u>

<u n="259" who="S0013"><unclear>where did we come from</unclear>? <pause dur="long"/> mm</u>
<u n="260" who="S0008">I don't know but they reckon that it's like the North American and South American Indians they don't know er how they got there now</u>
<u n="261" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="262" who="S0008">you know they sort of always assumed they came in at you know a certain period in time and sort of started <trunc>coloni</trunc></u>

<u n="267" who="S0013">mm</u>

<u n="270" who="S0008">and they said oh well perhaps they weren't the first perhaps there was these other ones</u>
<u n="271" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="272" who="S0008">cos they reckon</u>
<u n="273" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="274" who="S0012">yeah cos there's cos erm <pause dur="short"/> people up in northern er like Greenland and places like that are Chinese-like</u>
<u n="275" who="S0008">mm <pause dur="short"/> well I think the the the the sort of basic physical characteristics are only a very very minor</u>

<u n="278" who="S0013">mm</u>

<u n="283" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="284" who="S0008">the facial characteristics and like like you can't really</u>

<u n="286" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="287" who="S0008">you can't really sort of go by that I mean to a certain extent you can because they've probably got genes that don't happen somewhere else you know but</u>
<u n="288" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="289" who="S0008">you never know you see er you could get just like one gene suddenly alters</u>
<u n="290" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="291" who="S0008">right? and that gene is sort of carried on and you know through thousands of years it just takes over er you know if there's a particularly strong gene</u>
<u n="292" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="293" who="S0008">cos that's what they reckon don't they? they reckon some genes are stronger than others and er</u>
<u n="294" who="S0012">they do and I remember when we were at school we were doing we were doing er that type of thing and this teacher <pause dur="short"/> I can't think of his name I usually know all the names this teacher said we are gradually growing another finger</u>

<u n="302" who="S0008">mm</u>

<u n="311" who="S0012">that'd get in the way wouldn't it?</u>

<u n="335" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="336" who="S0008">like you know you get this sort of tree where these sort of divergent species come off and like right at the top</u>
<u n="337" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="338" who="S0008">there's sort of man went one way and apes went the other way</u>
<u n="339" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="340" who="S0008">so they didn't sorta like apes and then man came from the apes</u>

<u n="352" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="353" who="S0008">cos there was this really famous erm <trunc>archaeolog</trunc></u>

<u n="355" who="S0008">no that's alright you have it <unclear/></u>
<u n="356" who="S0012">good</u>
<u n="357" who="S0008">there was this really famous archaeologist right?</u>
<u n="358" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="359" who="S0008">I think his name was Skinner <pause dur="short"/> and er he's about my age <pause dur="short"/> but when he left school <pause dur="long"/> he or when he left university he had this theory about it's you know before the times of DNA or anything like that nobody anything about that <pause dur="short"/> he had this theory about <pause dur="short"/> now what the hell was it? it was all to do with skulls and sorta like of early man Neanderthal stuff like that and he went round every museum and scientific or er place in in erm <pause dur="short"/> well which was around which had</u>
<u n="360" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="361" who="S0008">early skulls <pause dur="short"/> you know I mean</u>
<u n="362" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="363" who="S0008">we're talking about skulls from</u>
<u n="364" who="S0012">donkey's years ago yeah</u>
<u n="365" who="S0008" trans="overlap">you know <trunc>s</trunc>sixty odd thousand</u>
<u n="366" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="367" who="S0008">or more years ago <pause dur="short"/> and er even even in Eastern Europe and Russia this was you know when the Iron Curtain was still up</u>
<u n="368" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="369" who="S0008">and he became this massive in later life a massive expert on you know human history</u>
<u n="370" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="371" who="S0008">you know ancient human history and how</u>
<u n="372" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="373" who="S0008">cos he'd he'd worked on these skulls and he'd he had these new theories where he could date them and relate them and stuff like this from you know the different aspects of them</u>
<u n="374" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="375" who="S0008">like the teeth and the and er cheekbones and god knows what you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="376" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="377" who="S0008">and and he'd sorta spend all his life you know you know dedicated to this branch and you know he was wildly acclaimed because</u>
<u n="378" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="379" who="S0008">he sorted it you know he sort of more or less solved loads of sorta theories or he didn't solve em but he gave a basis for other people to judge against and stuff like that</u>
<u n="380" who="S0012" trans="overlap">mm proved them yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="381" who="S0008">and then about I suppose ten year ago when they brought in DNA testing</u>
<u n="382" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="383" who="S0008">and stuff like that <pause dur="short"/> you know it just sorta wiped all his work out</u>
<u n="384" who="S0012">yeah it would do erm well yeah</u>
<u n="385" who="S0008">cos you know you can do <pause dur="short"/> everything that he'd spent all his life studying and relating just do drew one tooth and you know er er half an hour later you get the DNA</u>
<u n="386" who="S0012"><unclear/> yeah that's right yeah</u>
<u n="387" who="S0008">testing and not only DNA but they can</u>
<u n="388" who="S0012">oh</u>
<u n="389" who="S0008">like teeth are the most indestructible thing apparently</u>
<u n="390" who="S0012" trans="overlap">they are aren't they? yeah</u>
<u n="391" who="S0008">and er you can grind them up and do isotope analysis on em</u>
<u n="392" who="S0012">oh can you? oh right</u>
<u n="393" who="S0008">and tell where the people were born where you know where they lived</u>
<u n="394" who="S0012">all <trunc>co</trunc>cos of what they were eating and stuff like that yeah</u>
<u n="395" who="S0008" trans="overlap">and <pause dur="short"/> that's right yeah <pause dur="short"/> because you absorb these minute</u>

<u n="413" who="S0012">yes I suppose</u>

<u n="427" who="S0012">it would be</u>
<u n="428" who="S0008">well anyway yeah they're sort of now the problem is is er well the thing they're trying to work out is what they're doing you know why they were there you know?</u>
<u n="429" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="430" who="S0008">cos they don't know whether they were sacrifices or</u>
