<u n="89" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0241">so that's the description of what's on</u>
<u n="91" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0241">just so we know</u>
<u n="93" who="S0240" trans="overlap">is that what you sent us earlier on today?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah I can't <trunc>rem</trunc></u>
<u n="95" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0240" trans="overlap">er might have done</u>
<u n="97" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="98" who="S0240">I think so yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0241">erm so we know what the timings are <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> the <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> from <anon type="place"/> contacted me the other day and said so far there've been no bookings onto it but</u>
<u n="100" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="101" who="S0241">but she had only just put it on and erm and so could I let other people know about it so I contacted businesses and employer engagement here and everybody for them to promote it but then I emailed them back actually and said do you do you know have you any <trunc>re</trunc> idea why people might not have enrolled on it yet</u>
<u n="102" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="103" who="S0241">because erm it you asked us for it so I thought you you must have thought there was a demand</u>
<u n="104" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0241">erm but she hasn't got back to me about that but I just the main reason I wanted to say that to her was actually was because what I don't want them to do is they've paid us some money to prepare this and do the things that we've done and what I don't want them to do is start saying well as if this doesn't run that actually we'll get you to prepare something else because they've had our money now because</u>
<u n="107" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0241" trans="overlap">we've prepared it and they can use it another time</u>
<u n="109" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="112" who="S0241">and now I've already emailed them and said we you know we've <trunc>pre</trunc> this is the money that you've paid for us so far it has now been used up</u>
<u n="113" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="115" who="S0241">so erm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0238">well we've all put some time into it</u>
<u n="117" who="S0241">yeah so if it doesn't run I think it will I think I think we'll get some people in</u>
<u n="118" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0241">but erm I mean if it doesn't run then we could offer to run it again in the future some time but erm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0238">do they have a minimum number of people on?</u>
<u n="121" who="S0241">I don't think so because I mean when I went to the China one there were there was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> from <anon type="place"/> another person from <anon type="place"/> somebody else that kind of knew them from <vocal desc="laugh"/> and so there weren't actually that many at I think there were only about three or four actually businesses</u>
<u n="122" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="123" who="S0241" trans="overlap">as far as I could tell and that they were there making the numbers up I think</u>
<u n="124" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and that was with the China and me you know</u>
<u n="126" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="127" who="S0241">and do I count? so that sounded like</u>
<u n="128" who="S0238" trans="overlap">see the one that I went to there were at least twenty people there I would say</u>
<u n="129" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0238">so that's a quite quite a different thing</u>
<u n="131" who="S0241" trans="overlap">the Mexico one I went to had been a roomful</u>
<u n="132" who="S0240">I mean it's the time of year for people booking they people are just back from holiday since the bank holiday and all the rest</u>
<u n="133" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I would think that there'll be</u>
<u n="134" who="S0240" trans="overlap">they they they</u>
<u n="135" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that people won't start booking until next week</u>
<u n="136" who="S0240" trans="overlap">probably haven't got round to it yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0241">mm I said that to her as well I said people have been away and they won't have realised yet so right so then so we've got the structure there and so I suppose what we could do today is just go through the structure of what</u>
<u n="140" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0241">you know where just go through it as as if we were doing the day and see what's what the er so this is the first thing is <pause dur="long"/> the effective email communications obviously is this one so yeah it looks much I think it's we're just about there I did write some a few notes in but it was mostly just suggestion things <trunc>li</trunc> just little things so obviously the title's changed now</u>
<u n="142" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="143" who="S0241">but we I think we should keep speaking the same language on it even though it's not on the official title and then push successful what is the title that we call it now?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0238">success of international business through</u>
<u n="145" who="S0240" trans="overlap">that's more a subtitle isn't it that one?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0241" trans="overlap">oh yes so success in international business</u>
<u n="147" who="S0238" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="148" who="S0241">yeah so effective communication</u>
<u n="149" who="S0240">could that not go into the or is it too late to have that speaking the same language?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0241">they won't put it onto the website they said that the</u>
<u n="151" who="S0240" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="152" who="S0241">they said it's too long I sent them those I sent them two or three options that we're looking</u>
<u n="153" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well that's okay there that'll look works it fulfils</u>

<u n="315" who="S0240">mm oh yes that's better</u>

<u n="317" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="318" who="S0241">erm because</u>
<u n="319" who="S0240">we've gone purple</u>
<u n="320" who="S0241" trans="overlap">erm because I'm very corporate but part</u>
<u n="321" who="S0240" trans="overlap">that's much nicer</u>
<u n="322" who="S0241">and partly because</u>
<u n="323" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="324" who="S0241" trans="overlap">it does a bit of light blue so all of these bits</u>
<u n="325" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/> really?</u>
<u n="326" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0238">I much prefer purple</u>
<u n="328" who="S0241">so I made it purple and actually it is a nicer colour than the</u>
<u n="329" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="330" who="S0241">the blue is the standard one that comes up when you open a Word</u>
<u n="331" who="S0238">mm yeah</u>
<u n="332" who="S0241">and it makes you look lazy if you use that</u>
<u n="333" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="334" who="S0241">so actually it is better and so it's just that one page now</u>
<u n="335" who="S0240">why does why does that line go there and not over there? any particular reason?</u>
<u n="336" who="S0241">over where?</u>
<u n="337" who="S0240">well that blue extend to there but that blue didn't extend</u>
<u n="338" who="S0241" trans="overlap">oh good point yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/> so it just catches my eye <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="340" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah I didn't <trunc>not</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="341" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="342" who="S0241">good point we'll get rid of that yeah</u>
<u n="343" who="S0240" trans="overlap">but it looks lovely</u>
<u n="344" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="345" who="S0240">yeah much better</u>
<u n="346" who="S0241">so that's that and then well they'll just go through it and I'll let them fill it in and then</u>
<u n="347" who="S0238">right</u>
<u n="348" who="S0241">and then we can go through it and that's half an hour</u>
<u n="349" who="S0240">half an hour yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0241">so that is that right erm while we've got slide three up <pause dur="long"/> and then you do from slide four erm</u>
<u n="351" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and that's supposed to be <pause dur="long"/> is the are you saying the the agree disagree is thirty mins so that's forty minutes with the introduction?</u>
<u n="352" who="S0241" trans="overlap">mm yes</u>
<u n="353" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="354" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="355" who="S0238">right</u>
<u n="356" who="S0241">yeah and then we'd said originally in one of the previous meetings the PowerPoint is then forty minutes</u>
<u n="357" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="358" who="S0241">and the email exercise is ten minutes that was the idea</u>
<u n="359" who="S0238">okay</u>
<u n="360" who="S0241">to get to the break erm so what have I just written here? so you've got these notes haven't you you've said all that already it might be worth in in when you're seeing it all this what you're saying here we're gonna look at the culture and how it affects communication and voting on email and all the stuff that you'd written in your notes to say and you know there are some handouts as we go along and handouts at the end or something like that</u>
<u n="361" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="362" who="S0241">but it's very clear so I thought <pause dur="long"/> so I think that's fine the picture I think that's great cos you'd written you've written here about the image and everything</u>
<u n="363" who="S0238">yes yes</u>
<u n="364" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I think that's fine</u>
<u n="365" who="S0238">well er you I mean I got feedback on that mm and I think that's easy enough to read now and everything</u>
<u n="366" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="367" who="S0238">and it's about the right erm</u>
<u n="368" who="S0241">so then we get to this one about Edward T Hall</u>

<u n="374" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="375" who="S0240">mm yeah</u>
<u n="376" who="S0238">I mean what the the thing that I saw that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> did she was going something like a very wise professor called so and so and that sort of thing</u>
<u n="377" who="S0241"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="378" who="S0240">bit patronising</u>
<u n="379" who="S0238">which well it was a bit not so much patronising as cute</u>
<u n="380" who="S0241"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="381" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you know sort of</u>
<u n="382" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="383" who="S0238" trans="overlap">it would be sort of</u>

<u n="390" who="S0241">mm yeah</u>
<u n="391" who="S0238">you know and I actually though oh I wouldn't have said it like that at all so yes erm and I need to think so I need to think what to say</u>

<u n="399" who="S0240" trans="overlap">cultural anthropologist</u>
<u n="400" who="S0241">you don't need to write all that actually cos all I need to do actually is just why don't I just shove this through the printer? then any any handwritten stuff I've got in here you'll just get as well won't you?</u>
<u n="401" who="S0238">well it's alright I'll I can <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>

<u n="455" who="S0241">cos you'd said er high context might feel that the lower context would <unclear/> we would all feel pressurised to give answers and this kind of thing which is alright but there's also the high high context ones have an emphasis on not losing face <pause dur="short"/> so so if you ask <trunc>someb</trunc> so as an example if you ask if somebody mails you and asks you for information that you've already sent it to not say as I mentioned in my last email</u>
<u n="456" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="457" who="S0241">this is like this</u>
<u n="458" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="459" who="S0241">but to act</u>
<u n="460" who="S0240">mm</u>

<u n="462" who="S0238">mm</u>

<u n="464" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="465" who="S0241">so something like that</u>
<u n="466" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="467" who="S0240">yeah it's difficult</u>
<u n="468" who="S0238">yes yes I mean it's a good idea to have</u>
<u n="469" who="S0241">an example</u>
<u n="470" who="S0238">er various examples in the notes</u>
<u n="471" who="S0241">mm</u>

<u n="473" who="S0241">mm</u>

<u n="479" who="S0240">yeah</u>

<u n="482" who="S0238" trans="overlap">then you know but yes</u>
<u n="483" who="S0241">yeah so let me just write here <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="484" who="S0240">I mean in a way the examples are the most interesting part</u>
<u n="485" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes</u>

<u n="500" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="506" who="S0240" trans="overlap">the content of the rest of the email</u>
<u n="507" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="508" who="S0241">but actually what this is saying which was what <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> said from <anon type="place"/> is even though you're fully aware of that</u>
<u n="509" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="510" who="S0240">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="511" who="S0241">in business that it's no</u>
<u n="512" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="513" who="S0241">that it makes them lose face so it isn't worth</u>
<u n="514" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="515" who="S0241">saying that but just</u>
<u n="516" who="S0240" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="517" who="S0241">even though you're fully aware</u>
<u n="518" who="S0238" trans="overlap">so I think you very often when you do that you have got that sort of</u>
<u n="519" who="S0240" trans="overlap">I suppose so</u>
<u n="520" who="S0238">self-justification kind of motive</u>

<u n="522" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="523" who="S0238">and and what you're saying is don't just think about yourself but because</u>
<u n="524" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="525" who="S0238" trans="overlap">when it's in a business</u>
<u n="526" who="S0240">but that's a really good interesting example</u>
<u n="527" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="528" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah and that</u>
<u n="529" who="S0240" trans="overlap">and ask them how they would respond to that in an email</u>
<u n="530" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="531" who="S0240">get a you know</u>
<u n="532" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="533" who="S0240">a bit of a bit of to and fro on that and well</u>
<u n="534" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and then they might say it doesn't matter I just think oh yeah fine but but it a Japanese person for <trunc>exam</trunc> a high context person might</u>
<u n="535" who="S0240" trans="overlap">would take umbrage <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="536" who="S0241">take more might take it more <trunc>per</trunc> and you think well you know</u>
<u n="537" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="538" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="539" who="S0241">because they're losing face it's a bigger thing for them</u>
<u n="540" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="541" who="S0241">so I don't really wanna give that example of something like that anyway</u>
<u n="542" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="543" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="544" who="S0241">er and that was everything about that and it's time then isn't it next?</u>
<u n="545" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="546" who="S0241">and monochronic time and polychronic time erm <pause dur="long"/> oh yeah you'd written in your notes polychronic emphasise the process of transactions and involvement of people over the schedule <pause dur="short"/> and I thought you needed and example there</u>
<u n="547" who="S0238">mm okay</u>
<u n="548" who="S0241" trans="overlap">cos that's very hard to take up what that means</u>
<u n="549" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="550" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes yes okay fine</u>
<u n="551" who="S0241">er so what an example that I was reading about the other day was erm but it might be on the next slide actually that you say this but that a Brazilian for example if he knows he's got a meeting he might sort of and he's talking to somebody he might just meet he might carry on his conversation first and then arrive a bit late to the meeting <pause dur="short"/> cos he's chatting to the person that he's talking to</u>
<u n="552" who="S0240">and it would be rude to cut them off</u>
<u n="553" who="S0241" trans="overlap">it's more important than getting to the yeah</u>
<u n="554" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="555" who="S0241" trans="overlap">wouldn't wanna cut them off get to the meeting slightly late cos flexibility of meetings don't start on time anyway in our culture</u>
<u n="556" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I don't think that that's an example of</u>
<u n="557" who="S0241">involvement of people over scheduling</u>
<u n="558" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that's involvement of people yes okay yes</u>
<u n="559" who="S0241">I don't know about the <trunc>emphasi</trunc> process of transactions</u>
<u n="560" who="S0238">no</u>
<u n="561" who="S0241">cos I don't really know what it means</u>
<u n="562" who="S0240">mm no I don't know what I means either <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="563" who="S0241">so I don't <trunc>kn</trunc> I don't I've written I don't know what it means</u>
<u n="564" who="S0238" trans="overlap">er I think that that well my understanding was that they're looking at <pause dur="long"/> do your your example is of something else that is interfering with the transaction if you see what I <trunc>mea</trunc> a a <trunc>diff</trunc> you know your conversation isn't anything to do with the meeting I presume you mean</u>
<u n="565" who="S0241">no</u>
<u n="566" who="S0238">but I think this process of transactions is that that rather than worrying about we've got to get it all done by Tuesday it's we need to do it successfully and so that Johnny's involved and Sarah has her say and so and so gets a chance to show what they can do so it's more about</u>
<u n="567" who="S0241" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="568" who="S0238">how the whole thing works and whether it works successfully and</u>
<u n="569" who="S0241" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="570" who="S0238">rather than whether you know I mean quite often if you're meeting a deadline</u>
<u n="571" who="S0240" trans="overlap">rather than a result mm</u>
<u n="572" who="S0238">you can end up <pause dur="short"/> cutting somebody out of a loop</u>
<u n="573" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="574" who="S0238">because you just need to get something done by a certain time</u>
<u n="575" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah so it's about getting good centres then</u>
<u n="576" who="S0238">yes so</u>
<u n="577" who="S0240" trans="overlap">people are in agreement</u>
<u n="578" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that's that wasn't that was my understanding of</u>
<u n="579" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but it's not necessarily about successfully then is that it it's about because it can still be successful even if you miss some people out it just the end product might be successful</u>
<u n="580" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="581" who="S0241">it's just the that the people</u>
<u n="582" who="S0238" trans="overlap">but it's that</u>
<u n="583" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="584" who="S0238" trans="overlap">the process needs to be successful</u>
<u n="585" who="S0240" trans="overlap">the process</u>
<u n="586" who="S0238" trans="overlap">as well as the end product</u>
<u n="587" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="588" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I suppose is what I'm thinking yes</u>
<u n="589" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="590" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="591" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah cos the people</u>
<u n="592" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="593" who="S0241">can get upset about it so it's trying to involve all the people yeah</u>
<u n="594" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="595" who="S0241">erm</u>
<u n="596" who="S0240" trans="overlap">well that was on that erm questionnaire you sent us</u>
<u n="597" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="598" who="S0240">I did try that one about you know whether you thought it was better to get things done or</u>
<u n="599" who="S0241">oh yeah</u>
<u n="600" who="S0240">ensure that everybody</u>
<u n="601" who="S0241">everybody's involved</u>
<u n="602" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="603" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="604" who="S0240" trans="overlap">I didn't really have time to read all the results but <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="605" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="606" who="S0240">I will do I've printed them out</u>
<u n="607" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="608" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="609" who="S0238">so I other words you've put that question mark there so that needs a little bit more explanation</u>
<u n="610" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="611" who="S0238">which I think is fair enough yeah</u>
<u n="612" who="S0241">mm yeah yeah okay</u>
<u n="613" who="S0238" trans="overlap">it's very abstract that</u>
<u n="614" who="S0241">but I mean the thing about finishing the conversation before you know that you might get to the meeting a bit late</u>
<u n="615" who="S0238" trans="overlap">oh I'm not saying that that that's</u>
<u n="616" who="S0241" trans="overlap">that could come next anyway</u>
<u n="617" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="618" who="S0241">cos we've got the example</u>
<u n="619" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="620" who="S0241">er so that's fine and then the implications for business about time and it well you'll ask them what you know what they think</u>
<u n="621" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="622" who="S0241">but I added extra things</u>
<u n="623" who="S0238">good right</u>
<u n="624" who="S0241">I put value <trunc>spontan</trunc> I'll pin I'll copy this pitch but you might not be able to read it</u>
<u n="625" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes I think that's probably the best thing to do I haven't got the space</u>
<u n="626" who="S0241" trans="overlap">value spontaneity and improvisation</u>
<u n="627" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="628" who="S0241">so whereas we in polychronic cultures they've like Spain</u>
<u n="629" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="630" who="S0241">oh you now everything goes wrong when I go to Spain to give a talk but but it doesn't really matter cos that's fine it's all part of what happens and things so it doesn't matter that the the room is locked that we've gone to and then it all gets delayed and starts late and that</u>
<u n="631" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="632" who="S0241">and that the students are in a different place that it all ends up fine in the end and in fact that's the good thing about us that we can manage to</u>
<u n="633" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="634" who="S0241">improvise</u>
<u n="635" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="636" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="637" who="S0241">and and so <pause dur="short"/> erm so valuing spontaneity and improvisation viewing time in flexible</u>
<u n="638" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="639" who="S0241">so life isn't and you've said be flexible as the start and end time of meetings but I think it's because they view life as flexible view time as flexible so life isn't predictable so why bring why being why be so precise about schedules?</u>
<u n="640" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="641" who="S0240">and it's extremely annoying</u>
<u n="642" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="643" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="644" who="S0241">but only if you're not from a polychronic culture</u>
<u n="645" who="S0240" trans="overlap">but it but it</u>
<u n="646" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="647" who="S0240">well yeah but</u>
<u n="648" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I don't find it annoying</u>
<u n="649" who="S0240">but it's I've been</u>
<u n="650" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I do</u>
<u n="651" who="S0240" trans="overlap">for then ten years but <trunc>th</trunc> I had a <trunc>l</trunc>lot of Spanish guests visit me in <anon type="place"/> over the summer and we were arranged to meet they didn't they weren't there then we got a message saying they were coming they were only five minutes away in Morrisons' car park apparently it was a whole hour before they actually got you know</u>
<u n="652" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="653" who="S0240">and then it was like everything was thrown out and you know</u>
<u n="654" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm and I don't think that's</u>
<u n="655" who="S0240" trans="overlap">and then I thought and then when they arrived they arrived like a whirlwind you know and and that it didn't matter at all like you say</u>
<u n="656" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="657" who="S0240">they sort of managed to make it</u>
<u n="658" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I don't think that's just Spain though I think that's people who text</u>
<u n="659" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="660" who="S0238">because I have the same problem with English people that I know <pause dur="short"/> who are incapable of sticking to a timetable because they're so used to the fact that if they're running late they can just text someone and say it</u>
<u n="661" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="662" who="S0238">and they don't seem to realise that that is actually throwing me out</u>
<u n="663" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="664" who="S0238">because I've organised my life around the time they said they were going to come</u>
<u n="665" who="S0241">that's cos you're monochronic you see</u>
<u n="666" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes I'm very monochronic <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="667" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="668" who="S0241">and time don't time is something that is gets wasted or lost or</u>
<u n="669" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="670" who="S0238">well it's such that I from a practical point of view if you're cooking a meal from for somebody it's gonna be dried up in the oven if they arrive three hours later than they said they would <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="671" who="S0240">well in</u>
<u n="672" who="S0241">mm yeah the way we do it yeah</u>
<u n="673" who="S0238" trans="overlap">but you know</u>
<u n="674" who="S0241">the way that we do</u>
<u n="675" who="S0240" trans="overlap">the way the Spanish do it they wouldn't would it cos</u>
<u n="676" who="S0241" trans="overlap">they would they run it that way cooking them</u>
<u n="677" who="S0240" trans="overlap">they don't even they didn't I've been on Spain where they've invited me for a dinner and they haven't even started the shopping when I've arrived</u>
<u n="678" who="S0241">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="679" who="S0240">they all set off to the supermarket to buy the stuff for a barbeque</u>
<u n="680" who="S0238"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="681" who="S0240">and they I mean er one one place we went we were by the seaside and we just well all we wanted to do was eat and go to the beach and it went on and on and on and on and on and on and eventually we got to the beach about seven o'clock when they thought it was perfect time cos it was cool</u>
<u n="682" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="683" who="S0240">you know and there was the people had left the beach and</u>
<u n="684" who="S0238" trans="overlap">right yes</u>
<u n="685" who="S0240">oh <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="686" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah so it is just a different</u>
<u n="687" who="S0240">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="688" who="S0241">so it's so like as life isn't predictable why be so precise about schedules? schedules aren't important they value relationships with the people which we mentioned before</u>
<u n="689" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="690" who="S0241">so making schedules erm a <trunc>m</trunc> they value the relationships with the people more than they should getting the schedule right</u>
<u n="691" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="692" who="S0241">so they'll all meet each other in Morrisons' car park and make sure that they've all got there</u>
<u n="693" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="694" who="S0241">and if one person's really late</u>
<u n="695" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="696" who="S0241">they'll still wait for them rather than getting with the schedule whereas</u>
<u n="697" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="698" who="S0241">we would be saying oh we'll go along you come along later</u>
<u n="699" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="700" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but they'll not let that one person come along later though</u>
<u n="701" who="S0238">mm yes</u>
<u n="702" who="S0241">erm so they emphasise the being rather than doing he said make sure everyone who should be involve is involved which we mentioned just before hierarchies and stuff a Brazilian might be offended by the UK's insistence on punctuality or getting straight down to business <pause dur="short"/> er but the UK person might be offended by the Brazilian arriving late</u>
<u n="703" who="S0238">mm not so much offended as irritating I think</u>
<u n="704" who="S0241" trans="overlap">irritated yeah</u>
<u n="705" who="S0238">but I mean that can then mean that they show that irritation</u>
<u n="706" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="707" who="S0238">and that can that could escalate</u>
<u n="708" who="S0240">don't you think it's interesting how the British sort of you know we don't get down to business immediately we always have like a minute don't you find at every meeting</u>
<u n="709" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="710" who="S0240">there's always a minute or two however formal the meeting of friendly chit-chat and then immediately it's down to business</u>

<u n="712" who="S0240">it's like you have that bit don't you?</u>
<u n="713" who="S0238" trans="overlap">where you switch</u>
<u n="714" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="715" who="S0240">and you get really annoyed well if it goes on and on and on</u>
<u n="716" who="S0241" trans="overlap">too long</u>
<u n="717" who="S0240">yeah too long that bit cos you wanna get down to business but it seems like too abrupt to suddenly do it</u>
<u n="718" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="719" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="720" who="S0240">but other cultures don't do that</u>
<u n="721" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="722" who="S0240">they they don't know what's going on when we have our little chit-chat they think it's a social thing but it's not it's part of the</u>
<u n="723" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="724" who="S0240">part of the official part of the meeting in a way isn't it?</u>
<u n="725" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="726" who="S0240">it's become so</u>
<u n="727" who="S0241">it's yeah</u>
<u n="728" who="S0240">I think that's really interesting</u>
<u n="729" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="730" who="S0241">but you can't have it on too long like you say</u>
<u n="731" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="732" who="S0241" trans="overlap">cos otherwise it becomes</u>
<u n="733" who="S0240">yeah eats into your your time yeah</u>
<u n="734" who="S0241">and some and yeah and eating you know the fact that something eats into your time I don't think Spanish people more Spanish that I know would even think about thinks eating into their time</u>
<u n="735" who="S0240" trans="overlap">they don't no they don't <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="736" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="737" who="S0241">you know our concept that it can be wasted or used in that way er</u>
<u n="738" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="739" who="S0241">and some traditional time management programmes and books for businesses here don't necessarily work well in <trunc>pol</trunc>polychronic cultures</u>
<u n="740" who="S0238">no no</u>
<u n="741" who="S0241">cos it's all about doing urgent and to important and to do lists and things like that</u>
<u n="742" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="743" who="S0241">which just don't work in</u>
<u n="744" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="745" who="S0241">you know erm and then monochronic on the monochronic slide you'd put emphasise schedules punctuality preciseness and to do lists I wrote</u>
<u n="746" who="S0238">yes yes</u>
<u n="747" who="S0241" trans="overlap">erm emphasise doing things valuing productivity getting things done on time <trunc>peo</trunc> the in monochronic cultures we see things as <trunc>s</trunc> time as something that can be lost or wasted</u>
<u n="748" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="749" who="S0241">so it should be managed planned and used efficiently <pause dur="short"/> yet we spend our all our time feeling really rushed</u>
<u n="750" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="751" who="S0241" trans="overlap">don't we?</u>
<u n="752" who="S0240">yes</u>
<u n="753" who="S0241" trans="overlap">when we're doing that whereas in Spain</u>
<u n="754" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="755" who="S0241">they don't think about time in quite the same way and they're not trying to manage it</u>
<u n="756" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="757" who="S0241">and plan it all the time and so they're actually we what we would call not as productive cos somehow they're not do you know they've got meetings that <trunc>star</trunc> and have a start date which <trunc>th</trunc> starts late and then they haven't even got a finish date <trunc>someti</trunc> time sometimes</u>
<u n="758" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="759" who="S0241">so you don't even know when it's gonna finish so you can't put another meeting afterwards yet they somehow seem less rushed</u>
<u n="760" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="761" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="762" who="S0241">so</u>
<u n="763" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="764" who="S0241">so <trunc>e</trunc>even for all our focus on productivity and getting things done we still feel rushed</u>
<u n="765" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="766" who="S0241">and feel more rushed than them</u>
<u n="767" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="768" who="S0241">so erm so what issues would you predict? erm and you elicitate with everybody yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm I only wrote are the other things that monochronic people might feel frustration anger and impatience whereas the polychronics would feel offended or irritated</u>
<u n="769" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm yeah yeah</u>
<u n="770" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="771" who="S0241">I also here don't you mean P time there? the P time people are pressurised by constant reminders?</u>
<u n="772" who="S0238">no I meant <pause dur="long"/> no yes I do sorry yes</u>
<u n="773" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="774" who="S0238">which is why you were quite right when you said that rather than having this P time and end time you <trunc>n</trunc></u>
<u n="775" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="776" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="777" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you need and I but I I haven't done it in the notes</u>
<u n="778" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="779" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="780" who="S0238" trans="overlap">so yes you're right</u>
<u n="781" who="S0241">so yeah so that's well</u>
<u n="782" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="783" who="S0241">it's just some thinking to think about later</u>
<u n="784" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="785" who="S0241" trans="overlap">that on that slide it's P time er and then it's space <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="786" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="787" who="S0241">erm mm <pause dur="short"/> you haven't put countries for the space but it doesn't really matter you put countries for the time and the <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="788" who="S0238" trans="overlap">no I just kind of <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="789" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but I don't think it matters <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="790" who="S0238" trans="overlap">because a lot of them are the <trunc>sa</trunc></u>
<u n="791" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="792" who="S0238">I mean not always like Japan as you say is high context but</u>
<u n="793" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="794" who="S0238">I taught this summer I taught Spanish people in July and Japanese in August</u>
<u n="795" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/> really <trunc>interest</trunc></u>
<u n="796" who="S0238">and it was <pause dur="short"/> nine thirty start <vocal desc="laugh"/> walk I walked in at the first day at at nine twenty-three or something like that in order to <trunc>g</trunc> set the computer up and they're all sitting there waiting for it</u>
<u n="797" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="798" who="S0238">amazing <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="799" who="S0240">and what about the Spanish they drift in and</u>
<u n="800" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well they were actually they weren't bad because they were teachers</u>
<u n="801" who="S0240" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="802" who="S0238" trans="overlap">rather than students but they certainly weren't all there at nine-thirty no <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm so</u>
<u n="803" who="S0240" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> that's a good example as well you know</u>
<u n="804" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="805" who="S0240">the <trunc>co</trunc> the direct contrast like that</u>
<u n="806" who="S0238">yes but I didn't think that I <trunc>deliberate</trunc> I thought it's a bit too repetitive if we do the countries with all three concepts</u>
<u n="807" who="S0241">yeah I think you're right</u>
<u n="808" who="S0238" trans="overlap">particularly since it's a lot of the same</u>
<u n="809" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yes I agree I agree</u>
<u n="810" who="S0238" trans="overlap">countries</u>
<u n="811" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="812" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that's why I didn't bother</u>
<u n="813" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="814" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="815" who="S0241">no I think you're right I think you're right about that erm then you say personal spaces are figurative rather than a literal sense</u>
<u n="816" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="817" who="S0241">and I think <pause dur="short"/> I think if you say that in a in a in the meeting people won't</u>
<u n="818" who="S0240">they won't</u>
<u n="819" who="S0238">no well I mean</u>
<u n="820" who="S0241" trans="overlap">get</u>
<u n="821" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I would explain what that meant</u>
<u n="822" who="S0241">right okay</u>
<u n="823" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="824" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah erm how would you <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="825" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that isn't a script</u>
<u n="826" who="S0241">oh right that's just you explaining it</u>
<u n="827" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that is notes</u>
<u n="828" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="829" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="830" who="S0241">yeah yeah so you'd just say it</u>
<u n="831" who="S0238">er</u>
<u n="832" who="S0241">so that is that I don't think there's anything else to add there</u>
<u n="833" who="S0240">it is partly physical though isn't it this didn't that you stand there <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="834" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that's that's yes but that's a different that <trunc>b</trunc> but I er I don't know to what extent those things correlate</u>
<u n="835" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="836" who="S0238">I mean maybe they do</u>
<u n="837" who="S0240">mm it's quite relevant to meetings and things isn't it yeah</u>
<u n="838" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that is also relevant yes</u>
<u n="839" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="840" who="S0241">yeah the highest space ones maintain social distance and and the low space ones will allow to be closer but whether you actually are physically</u>
<u n="841" who="S0238">that's what I that's what she's talking about <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="842" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="843" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I think you are</u>
<u n="844" who="S0238">I would think that there probably is quite a strong correlation there</u>
<u n="845" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="846" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="847" who="S0238" trans="overlap">but I don't actually know so</u>
<u n="848" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="849" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="850" who="S0241">but I would imagine so</u>
<u n="851" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="852" who="S0241">er and so let's so you explain them and then what the implications are there for business the importance of interpersonal exchange interesting in long term relationships over short term gain so my example was it's not just about the making the sale now but</u>
<u n="853" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="854" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="855" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but building up that relationship</u>
<u n="856" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="857" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="858" who="S0241">erm and you had that example about when you were invited out for dinner with some students and erm actually with a student do you remember? you were invited out for dinner with a student and you weren't sure what it was why the student had invited you out</u>
<u n="859" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="860" who="S0241">you were a bit worried that cos it was a <trunc>m</trunc> boy or it was a man or something that you thought it might be a date or that he might be thinking of it as a date but actually he was just wanting English classes for his niece or something</u>
<u n="861" who="S0238" trans="overlap">it was a senior executive at <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="862" who="S0241">oh right</u>
<u n="863" who="S0238">not a boy <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="864" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="865" who="S0238">erm and and when I got there I immediately knew it wasn't a date because he introduced me to his mistress</u>
<u n="866" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="867" who="S0238">and since I knew someone who taught his small children and therefore knew his wife I was really quite and quite offended by the whole thing but I couldn't say anything</u>
<u n="868" who="S0241">and how did you know it was his mistress then cos you knew his wife?</u>
<u n="869" who="S0238">cos he introduced me er this is my girlfriend</u>
<u n="870" who="S0240">oh <trunc>g</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="871" who="S0238">and she's twenty-three</u>
<u n="872" who="S0241">see there's an example for you</u>
<u n="873" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="874" who="S0241">about</u>
<u n="875" who="S0238">and it was and the most important thing about her was the fact that she was twenty-three she was quite ugly</u>
<u n="876" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="877" who="S0238">in my opinion but she was twenty-three and he was in his forties and you know</u>
<u n="878" who="S0241"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="879" who="S0240">well there you go</u>
<u n="880" who="S0238">er and then he took me to this host took us we went to eat and then we went to this hostess bar which okay was because <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't his niece it was the niece of the <foreign lang="jpn">mamasan</foreign> of the hostess bar</u>
<u n="881" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="882" who="S0238">where he went so he was there with his girlfriend and <trunc>sev</trunc> for about three other hostesses and the <foreign lang="jpn">mamasan</foreign> all fawning round him</u>
<u n="883" who="S0240"><trunc>go</trunc></u>
<u n="884" who="S0238">one of the erm girls was from Taiwan so she and I had a little conversation in Chinese about the whole thing</u>
<u n="885" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="886" who="S0238">it was quite interesting nobody else could understand <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="887" who="S0241">I mean it's a good example not necessarily in so much detail</u>
<u n="888" who="S0238">no <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="889" who="S0241">but it's a good example of how you just you know you don't quite know what but actually his whole thing was erm that he was <trunc>tryi</trunc> thinking about the space and that he was just trying to create this relationship so that he could get something out of it</u>
<u n="890" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm whereas anybody else would from another culture would just ask straight out wouldn't they?</u>
<u n="891" who="S0241" trans="overlap">would just ask</u>
<u n="892" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="893" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah that's it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="894" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="895" who="S0241"><event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="896" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes if that had been in Germany</u>
<u n="897" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="898" who="S0238">they'd just have said</u>
<u n="899" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="900" who="S0238">you know so and so wants an English lesson</u>
<u n="901" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="904" who="S0238">erm</u>
<u n="905" who="S0241">erm so yeah what are the implications for business? high space cultures tend to focus on task and maintaining social distance as you say distinguish more between work life and private life erm and you've left the space bubble the bubble empty cos it's more about what you're not talking about it's that</u>
<u n="906" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="907" who="S0241" trans="overlap">you're not talking so much about private life and things like that</u>
<u n="908" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="909" who="S0241">erm and I don't know when we were I've written here actually standing <trunc>cl</trunc> I did assume it was connected standing close to each other</u>

<u n="911" who="S0241">the UK the British person keeps moving backwards on the pavement</u>

<u n="914" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="915" who="S0241">I for me to have written that I have read that somewhere</u>
<u n="916" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="917" who="S0238">oh I mean that's definitely true but what I was reading was they did actually say you know we're talking for about figurative space rather than</u>
<u n="918" who="S0240">literal</u>
<u n="919" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="920" who="S0238" trans="overlap">literally the literal space</u>
<u n="921" who="S0240">well you could bring it up</u>
<u n="922" who="S0238" trans="overlap">but I would I</u>

<u n="929" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="930" who="S0238">erm</u>
<u n="931" who="S0241"><unclear/> and and <trunc>th</trunc> you know things that you don't ask about so we don't ask about salary or age or things like that whereas I was wanting a in <trunc>th</trunc> in the tube in Madrid we met this girl that was selling flowers Chinese girl and she asked me my salary and she'd only been like speaking to me two minutes</u>
<u n="932" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="933" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and that's <event desc="unintelligible"/> China</u>

<u n="935" who="S0241" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="936" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="937" who="S0238">it was quite a common question</u>
<u n="938" who="S0241">mm so things like that and then what issues might arise in email communication between them and you've got examples there <pause dur="short"/> erm yeah that was that and then what about you I would just put that in one colour</u>
<u n="939" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="940" who="S0241">rather than three different colours cos it looks a bit</u>
<u n="941" who="S0238">well it was supposed to be varying from red to green which is what we've been looking at but I've</u>
<u n="942" who="S0241">ah I see I didn't get that but</u>
<u n="943" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="944" who="S0241">I like the idea</u>
<u n="945" who="S0238">okay well if you the</u>
<u n="946" who="S0241">I just wondered why is it in three different colours</u>
<u n="947" who="S0240" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="948" who="S0241">so but you if you clarify that it would be fine what are you are you red? and</u>
<u n="949" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="950" who="S0241" trans="overlap">cos people might not have necessarily noticed</u>
<u n="951" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="952" who="S0241">so are <trunc>h</trunc>high space so red is high space low space high context and polychronic</u>
<u n="953" who="S0238">yes yeah</u>
<u n="954" who="S0241">yeah and this is monochronic</u>
<u n="955" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="956" who="S0241">and low space <pause dur="short"/> so I mean for people to remember that it's quite difficult anyway I think</u>
<u n="957" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I think so I think the terminology can be a bit yeah</u>
<u n="958" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I can't remember it now</u>
<u n="959" who="S0240">I don't think you need to remind them of the you know</u>

<u n="988" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="989" who="S0240">it depends how much they join in as it's going through I mean it would nice if they do</u>
<u n="990" who="S0241" trans="overlap">they might <trunc>no</trunc></u>
<u n="991" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah and sort of chip in with examples from their own international experiences</u>
<u n="992" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="993" who="S0238">well I mean also</u>
<u n="994" who="S0240" trans="overlap">they might or might not have that</u>
<u n="995" who="S0238">if if we have had a bit at the beginning of which cultures they've had experience of and so on</u>
<u n="996" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="997" who="S0238">and I can remember who's <trunc>d</trunc> who's said what when I might be able to</u>
<u n="998" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="999" who="S0238">look at specific people and say when</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0238">you know when you were in Turkey what did you you know that sort of thing as well as</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0238">erm what do you think</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0241" trans="overlap">well you see if we have a flip chart</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0238">we might be able to get one of us might be able to write down somebody's name and the countries or something like that</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0241" trans="overlap">or just a few points as we go</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0238">I mean obviously</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0241" trans="overlap">so we've got it as a reference</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0238" trans="overlap">it would be good if we'd got some people with different</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0238">first languages</u>
<u n="1015" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1016" who="S0238" trans="overlap">or different cultures but <trunc>e</trunc>even if they haven't if they've been in other places then we could ask</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="1020" who="S0241">er and then we've got the final quotes here</u>
<u n="1021" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0241">er and then I've just put erm with the final quotes and so erm <pause dur="short"/> that actually but it's always worth remembering that it's more about cos we will remind them it's not stereotyping</u>
<u n="1023" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0241" trans="overlap">they're all individuals</u>
<u n="1025" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1026" who="S0241">but it is much more about everybody is of course an individual in every <trunc>cul</trunc> in these cultures</u>
<u n="1027" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="1028" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1029" who="S0241">and that it is more about being sensitive to others and adjusting it to other</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0241">other people's norms especially if you're selling to them <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> than than  having hard and fast rules with these</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0240" trans="overlap">and also don't you think you know it's likely that as as business becomes more internationalised that <trunc>peo</trunc> you know all these differences will become lesser <pause dur="short"/> become diminished because of you know I mean in the same way that language has become reduced to a simplified version of language I think it's likely that a lot of the differences will be smoothed out over time and probably that process is starting to happen at the moment</u>
<u n="1033" who="S0238">maybe</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0240" trans="overlap">I think that's quite an interesting question of whether they</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0241" trans="overlap">maybe</u>
<u n="1036" who="S0240"><trunc>wheth</trunc>whether they think that</u>
<u n="1037" who="S0238">but</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0238">but I think <pause dur="short"/> I think we've a lot way to go before that happens</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1041" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1042" who="S0238">and I think there's a danger if you're speaking the same if you're all speaking English of making the assumption that</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah well yeah</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0238">that you're singing from the same hymn sheet</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0238">you know</u>
<u n="1048" who="S0240">that's quite a <trunc>g</trunc> that's a nice point to finish on as well yeah</u>
<u n="1049" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I mean I've had that experience with <trunc>w</trunc>with Germans who will often speak really good English</u>
<u n="1050" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="1051" who="S0238">but being quite abrupt the way they would be in German</u>
<u n="1052" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1053" who="S0238">and they come across as rude</u>
<u n="1054" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0238">and and that's why Germans have this reputation for being rude not because they are</u>
<u n="1056" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1057" who="S0238">cos what they're saying wouldn't be rude in their own language</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0238">but in English it is erm and I think <trunc>bec</trunc> again because they speak English it it's both sides are making assumptions because their English is so good</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0240">yes yeah</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0238">that that they've got the culture right as well</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0240">that's an interesting point isn't it I think that's yeah</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0240">worth mentioning</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0241">and then I think the only thing I've written at the end oh I you I just I'd I don't think you need to put that cos it's just a lot of words to read why don't you say how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language? do we need that first line even though it is his quote but does it matter?</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0240" trans="overlap">let's see</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0241">after all when you come right down to it how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language?</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0240">you don't think that we need that quote at all no?</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I don't think we need that first line</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0240">no</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0241">I think we just say how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language? and then you make that point that you've just made</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0240">yeah mm</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0238">erm well I wasn't necessarily going to read those out I was gonna leave them on the thing</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0240">yeah you could just leave them</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0238">if you change that you can't make that into a capital H that's the actual quotation you'd have to have a dot dot dot and a small H wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0241"><trunc>y</trunc> er</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0238">it's not the beginning</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0241" trans="overlap">if you were academic yeah if you're in a business meeting no it just looks odd</u>
<u n="1080" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1081" who="S0241">you know what's it matter how exact your quotation you know he did say this it's just not the start of the sentence but it actually doesn't matter does it in a you know in in the rest of the world it doesn't actually matter</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0240">no <vocal desc="laugh"/> it doesn't</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0241" trans="overlap">in real life whether they do or not</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I don't my</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0240" trans="overlap">they might expect speakers from a university in case they've been through the process</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0238">yeah</u>

<u n="1088" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I doubt well they're not even gonna know nobody's gonna go actually I I know that quote</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1090" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and it's not the start of the sentence</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1092" who="S0238">no as I say I I was just gonna put the the slide up and talk rather than read I don't really believe in read reading things off slides</u>
<u n="1093" who="S0241" trans="overlap">no I don't think you need to no I'm not suggesting you read it out but</u>
<u n="1094" who="S0240">just something to leave you with</u>
<u n="1095" who="S0241">to leave them with</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0241">yeah erm <pause dur="short"/> but I just don't think you need as many words</u>
<event desc="unintelligible"/>
<u n="1098" who="S0240" trans="overlap">in a way I mean in a way one would be better than two as a final thing to leave them with because</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I put that other thing in because I liked both of those</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0240" trans="overlap">cos once they sit in silence to <trunc>re</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0238" trans="overlap">but yes you're right</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0240">it always goes back to the audience you're trying to reach and the way they think about their problems I think that one</u>
<u n="1104" who="S0238">you think yeah</u>
<u n="1105" who="S0240">just leave that</u>
<u n="1106" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah I think that first one yeah</u>
<u n="1107" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah yeah cos it's and then in fact if you were gonna have just that one you might as well have the whole one cos it's not too much</u>
<u n="1108" who="S0238">I</u>
<u n="1109" who="S0241" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0240" trans="overlap">too many words</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0238">I think it's more</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0241" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0240">but that one's got it's nice</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0238" trans="overlap">but it is more rounded with that bit with that</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0241" trans="overlap">mm it is more rounded I was just thinking cos it's a lot of words</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0238" trans="overlap">it might be yeah</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but but yeah just put one actually because we're calling it speaking the language that's good isn't it</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah it goes back to the beginning</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0238">yes right</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0241"><vocal desc="sigh"/> we nailed it</u>

<u n="1126" who="S0238">jolly good</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0241">so that's a big one and then so you do that get to the end of that and then say so you know so we've looked at how this these different aspects of culture relate to erm the business environment so we're just gonna look now at a few emails and how to see this in practice with some emails and then we've got the handout with the emails and everything which is this one here so we'll have done that one</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0240">what time would it be here then? we've done ten minutes on the introductions half an hour on the</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0241">agree disagree</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0240">on the agree disagree</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0241" trans="overlap">well for the whole</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0240">and then</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0238">so</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0240">that's forty</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0241">and then</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0240" trans="overlap">and so how long for the slides to plan?</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and then forty minutes on the slides</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0240">forty minutes okay</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0241">and then ten minutes on this final</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0241">or thirty-five forty minutes on the slides and then this final thing here which is this what</u>
<u n="1142" who="S0240" trans="overlap">ten minutes</u>
<u n="1143" who="S0241">erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean I've printed up all three pages out for us but actually you'd only give them the first one</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0240">I was wondering if there's any way I tried to do it but didn't have time to do it properly was is to get erm you know an email looking format pro forma or whatever you call it to put them in cos it would just look it would look much nicer</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0241">oh</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0240">on the page</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0240">I don't know if you know how to do that</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0238">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1150" who="S0240" trans="overlap">I tried for a bit but I thought I was going to be late for the meeting if I carried on doing it with my I'm sure you can</u>
<u n="1151" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1152" who="S0240">but it just it would just look</u>
<u n="1153" who="S0241" trans="overlap">mm it would be yeah you're right</u>
<u n="1154" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0241">it would look better</u>
<u n="1156" who="S0238">I'll play about with that</u>
<u n="1157" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1158" who="S0238">and see if I can work out what to do</u>
<u n="1159" who="S0240">what would you call it? pro forma or</u>
<u n="1160" who="S0238" trans="overlap">have you got the er</u>
<u n="1161" who="S0241">shall I send it I'll send it to you</u>
<u n="1162" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah the yeah</u>
<u n="1163" who="S0241" trans="overlap">to play with yeah</u>
<u n="1164" who="S0240">I mean it might just be a question of somehow dragging a copy pasting deleting and then inputting I don't know but</u>
<u n="1165" who="S0238">well I'll try I'll try doing that yeah</u>
<u n="1166" who="S0240" trans="overlap">in the short time I tried it I couldn't do that but</u>
<u n="1167" who="S0241">you could somehow you know you could do print screen can't you so if you had it</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0240">oh a screenshot yeah</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="1170" who="S0241">you could do a screenshot so you could like create an email that says this somehow and then print screen and you'd get it but I don't know how it would work see how it goes but then so you would then need on this but I would think won't we just all as anybody else could chip in any time</u>
<u n="1171" who="S0238" trans="overlap">at this point we'll all chip in</u>
<u n="1172" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="1173" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes I think so</u>
<u n="1174" who="S0241">but it er what about during the PowerPoint itself?</u>
<u n="1175" who="S0238"><vocal desc="sigh"/> I don't know what do you think?</u>
<u n="1176" who="S0241">you've always you've gotta be aware of the timing</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0241">but it might help to move it along at times and things like that</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0240" trans="overlap">what to chip in with stories?</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0241" trans="overlap">if like we chip in at the same time</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0240">well I think so cos it varies it as well</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0240">but only if well <trunc>y</trunc>you could you know you could indicate when you wanted a a <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> story or mm you know</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0241">you won't know when I've got one though</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0238" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0240">well if you do because you've</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but I think if we just</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0240">well you've been saying</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah but she wouldn't know you wouldn't at that moment you won't necessarily think oh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s got a story about that or yeah and</u>
<u n="1190" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0241">but I think it I would imagine we just play it by ear on the day and we're conscious about time as well so you're not</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0241">chip in too many of of erm if we see the time's going and then we've got ten minutes to do this one</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0238">I certainly think with any kind of thing when we're eliciting things from them or</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0241">try and let them talk</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that that yes but</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1199" who="S0238">but it's fine for any to to</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0238">to chip in at that point</u>
<u n="1202" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah as long as they get a chance to speak as well</u>
<u n="1203" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you know so <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="1204" who="S0241">so yeah and so yeah so then you'll introduce this exercise</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0241" trans="overlap">wouldn't you about erm the scenario and erm and why did they think and then I've put on the next page which we wouldn't give to them</u>
<u n="1207" who="S0238">no right</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but the next page is kind of the answers that you might want to point out to them on the next two and that I think that's the original one so the next page tells you the answers is it that way so</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0241" trans="overlap">so if you have a go at that and send it back to us then we <trunc>c</trunc> can get it changed</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0240">do you really think we can do this in ten minutes? cos even just for them to read them it's gonna</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0241">actually it's not</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0240" trans="overlap">you know</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0241" trans="overlap">it's gonna take more than ten minutes isn't it</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0240" trans="overlap">it's gonna take more than ten minutes definitely</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0240">for them to read them give their ideas and then decide</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0241">we need to shorten the agree and disagree a bit</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0240">I would say so actually</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0241" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0240">anyway because</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0241" trans="overlap">it's a bit long anyway</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0240">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0241">or was it that was something I was gonna bring up earlier actually so let's say</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0240">or or ask them to look at the first <trunc>t</trunc> oh er you know to start with and then have three as a <trunc>ne</trunc> well they're quite nice all sort of all them aren't they</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0241" trans="overlap">well they need all three cos it's</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah they do no yeah they do need all three</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0241">so if we said that the agree and disagree was twenty minutes instead of thirty</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0241">and then you've got twenty minutes for the emails haven't you? you've got twenty minutes to do that so that would be better let's do it that way <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="1231" who="S0240">mm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="1232" who="S0241">right</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0240">twenty <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="1234" who="S0241">okay so then so then you do that bit and then I have created this well you created it this handout here about and this is the purple that I'm gonna use</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh yeah right</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0241">erm</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0240">oh that's good yeah</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0241">this erm this handout for them and on the back I've put some quotes <pause dur="long"/> so there's the quote I mean</u>
<u n="1239" who="S0238">mm yes</u>
<u n="1240" who="S0241">bits of the first one and the most important thing is probably you know is</u>
<u n="1241" who="S0240" trans="overlap">I like that that's good</u>
<u n="1242" who="S0241" trans="overlap">you know what it is what it is he said</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0238">you could of course have made the outlines of those purple as well</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0241">I just wanted to vary it I did it on both</u>
<u n="1245" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1246" who="S0241">I just think it's sort of a bit boring if it's just all purple</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0241">but do you think it should be purple?</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0238">I don't think it really matters <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1250" who="S0240">I think I would centralise those it would look better</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0238">okay</u>
<u n="1252" who="S0241">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1253" who="S0240" trans="overlap">it's just</u>
<u n="1254" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1255" who="S0240">you know it's just</u>
<u n="1256" who="S0238">well you've got the less</u>
<u n="1257" who="S0240" trans="overlap">the way it sits</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0238">you've got your version with with those on</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I'll do it</u>
<u n="1260" who="S0238">so you do it</u>
<u n="1261" who="S0241">yeah <pause dur="long"/> okay yeah I can do that</u>
<u n="1262" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and <trunc>poss</trunc> oh yeah erm</u>
<u n="1263" who="S0241">and?</u>
<u n="1264" who="S0238">no I was just gonna say they're actually in they look fairly small print don't they but</u>
<u n="1265" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1266" who="S0238">if you made it any bigger it would be a longer box</u>
<u n="1267" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I'll look at that</u>
<u n="1268" who="S0238">so that's probably not such a good idea</u>
<u n="1269" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah I see how it works</u>
<u n="1270" who="S0240" trans="overlap">or could it be two columns there and one in the middle there I don't know cos they do look a little bit small compared to the other one</u>
<u n="1271" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1272" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1273" who="S0238">anyway</u>
<u n="1274" who="S0240" trans="overlap">or <trunc>may</trunc> could they be randomised you know dotted around?</u>
<u n="1275" who="S0241">then it's hard to read isn't it</u>
<u n="1276" who="S0238" trans="overlap">that is</u>
<u n="1277" who="S0240">oh</u>
<u n="1278" who="S0238">yeah that's</u>
<u n="1279" who="S0241">I don't think it <trunc>mat</trunc> I think it's big enough to read</u>
<u n="1280" who="S0240" trans="overlap">no it's just it's</u>
<u n="1281" who="S0241">so</u>
<u n="1282" who="S0240">okay</u>
<u n="1283" who="S0241">er and then I have this other handout for some point or other erm which is the</u>
<u n="1284" who="S0240">oh the one you sent yeah</u>
<u n="1285" who="S0241" trans="overlap">which we were <trunc>gon</trunc> maybe do at the end</u>
<u n="1286" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1287" who="S0241">a handout at the end to them erm</u>
<u n="1288" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1289" who="S0241">cos I don't know how we're gonna hand all these handouts out some of them we need to give them at the time cos they're doing it like the agree and disagree</u>
<u n="1290" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1291" who="S0241">they're yours but others</u>
<u n="1292" who="S0238">I think that's probably at the end of the session</u>
<u n="1293" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0241">and the end of the session</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0241">but what do we give them to them in?</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0240">we need a little pack yeah which one erm</u>
<u n="1298" who="S0241">we're not gonna give them it I don't know what pack we give them though because we haven't actually got unless and <anon type="place"/> have like a little folder we can put them in</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well is this another is this another question to ask her?</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0238">because ideally I would say that they should be given a <pause dur="long"/> I mean either you give them a folder at the end with various things that we're only handing out at the end in and they can put everything that we've worked on that they've had during the sessions</u>
<u n="1302" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1303" who="S0238">into it as well</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0238">or you give them the folder at the beginning with the first handout and say you'll be getting other things that you can put in there</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1308" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1309" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I mean either way would work wouldn't it but</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah that would be good</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0238">but if we're supposed to be providing a folder then we need to know</u>
<u n="1313" who="S0241">so we'll ask cos we can't provide one cos you're not going to have one with <anon type="place"/> on necessarily</u>
<u n="1314" who="S0238" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1315" who="S0241">so I'll ask her if she's got a folder and if not we just hand these out at the end</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0241">erm so <trunc>y</trunc> so that would be in purple and so if you look through these at some point when we get points and see if there's anything that you want me to change and there's your chance <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="1319" who="S0240">can we give some examples? when we <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="1320" who="S0238" trans="overlap">we've done that already haven't we?</u>
<u n="1321" who="S0240" trans="overlap">we've done it</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0240">oh okay for maintaining good relationships <unclear/></u>
<u n="1323" who="S0241">well but that's the whole thing by the time they get to this</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I think this</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0241">they'll have had loads of examples from you won't they?</u>

<u n="1329" who="S0240">yeah so first naming conventions the use of first names or honorific titles <pause dur="long"/> do you think that's a bit <pause dur="short"/> use of <pause dur="short"/> you know could be phrased in more <trunc>s</trunc> in simpler international English type language?</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0238">well this this is</u>

<u n="1375" who="S0240">meetings and emails and I'm gonna start start off by talking about yeah</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and this is where you start off and we say well first of all we're gonna look at using <trunc>internat</trunc> so the theme is <trunc>inter</trunc> is language isn't it it's trying to point out and it's language and we use erm so how we use language when writing emails first of all erm whereas the <trunc>e</trunc> this one before is about culture isn't it</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0241">more than the language</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0241">so actually we've gotta make sure we remember that that when we're doing this one it's not about looking at specific</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0241">well language items as that it's about looking at</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="1386" who="S0240" trans="overlap">culture</u>
<u n="1387" who="S0241">the culture so the first half is all about culture and you can say what it's about at the beginning of the day the first half of the day is about culture</u>

<u n="1757" who="S0240">erm I I've I am concerned that we may need more you know something like that please can we discuss isn't it</u>
<u n="1758" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="1759" who="S0240">you need a call for action</u>
<u n="1760" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="1761" who="S0240">we discuss I mean I actually wrote an email very similar to this my niece sent me erm she's supposed to be creating a a book for my <trunc>ni</trunc></u>
<u n="1762" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1763" who="S0240">my father's ninetieth birthday and she's collecting all his writings that he's done all through his life together</u>

<u n="1769" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="1770" who="S0240">it's like I think that's <vocal desc="laugh"/> slightly on the optimistic side there may be some you know holdups and delays that we have to</u>
<u n="1771" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="1772" who="S0240">allow for please ensure that you know that it does it doesn't <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="1773" who="S0241" trans="overlap">see maybe in this one you don't actually need to write it in a better like the first one you might say think about a better way to put it</u>
<u n="1774" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1775" who="S0241">what did they intend to say? think about a better way the second I know you're asking the question in the instructions but in this second one you maybe you don't need to actually have a <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="1776" who="S0240" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="1777" who="S0241">you maybe just need to get the get across the point that actually they mean this is a problem</u>
<u n="1778" who="S0240">yeah it's</u>
<u n="1779" who="S0241">and it's not rather on the optimistic side it's totally unrealistic</u>
<u n="1780" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="1781" who="S0240" trans="overlap">okay so it's not how could she have written it more clearly so what do you think the writer intended to say? I could get rid of that second instruction couldn't she couldn't I?</u>
<u n="1782" who="S0241">well I think you leave it but you don't necessarily need to do it every</u>
<u n="1783" who="S0240" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="1784" who="S0241">every question necessarily</u>
<u n="1785" who="S0238">yeah well see whether they come with something</u>

<u n="1787" who="S0238">I mean it is a tricky one</u>
<u n="1788" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1789" who="S0238" trans="overlap">in that you <trunc>don</trunc> you've got this issue of face and if you say I'm sorry I think that your solution is really your solution and your costings are really unrealistic</u>
<u n="1790" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="1791" who="S0238">you're being quite rude and and putting them down</u>

<u n="1796" who="S0238">erm</u>
<u n="1797" who="S0241">but you could say I think I think probably your answer is something to do with can we discuss the</u>
<u n="1798" who="S0238">yes so maybe a solution is</u>
<u n="1799" who="S0241" trans="overlap">the quotes so can we discuss this problem and the budget in a bit more detail?</u>
<u n="1800" who="S0240">yeah</u>

<u n="1802" who="S0241">erm</u>
<u n="1803" who="S0238">so maybe so you can</u>
<u n="1804" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but look at different ways to solve it or something</u>
<u n="1805" who="S0240">or yeah how to finish it</u>
<u n="1806" who="S0241" trans="overlap">or something like that</u>
<u n="1807" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="1808" who="S0241">rather than saying this isn't working say can we</u>

<u n="2454" who="S0241" trans="overlap">because</u>
<u n="2455" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="2456" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and and so</u>
<u n="2457" who="S0240">so not clear what the real not clear what the message is really is it?</u>
<u n="2458" who="S0241">well I think it is clear that the message is the message is the project's not viable</u>
<u n="2459" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="2460" who="S0241" trans="overlap">it's just that people often will</u>
<u n="2461" who="S0240" trans="overlap">to a native speaker it is</u>
<u n="2462" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2463" who="S0240">but erm to a non-native</u>
<u n="2464" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I think it's just a long-winded way to saying it</u>
<u n="2465" who="S0240">yeah a long long-winded</u>
<u n="2466" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and we're looking at language aren't we?</u>
<u n="2467" who="S0240">okay too long-winded</u>
<u n="2468" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="2469" who="S0240">and their their job is to simply that's</u>
<u n="2470" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="2471" who="S0238">yeah I mean those those first two sentences</u>
<u n="2472" who="S0240" trans="overlap">do you think it's a bit similar to doing this though?</u>
<u n="2473" who="S0238" trans="overlap">should be run together shouldn't they as I'm sorry but</u>
<u n="2474" who="S0241">but here they don't have to simplify it you're asking them to identify problems not simplify it</u>
<u n="2475" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm yes</u>
<u n="2476" who="S0240" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="2477" who="S0238">actually that is true</u>
<u n="2478" who="S0240" trans="overlap">and <event desc="unintelligible"/> possible problems</u>
<u n="2479" who="S0238" trans="overlap">they're not rewriting are they?</u>
<u n="2480" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yes okay and that would be good</u>
<u n="2481" who="S0241" trans="overlap">otherwise they're doing the same as the last exercise</u>

<u n="2483" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="2484" who="S0240" trans="overlap">so that would be good for timing as well</u>
<u n="2485" who="S0241" trans="overlap">so what's the problem with it?</u>
<u n="2486" who="S0240" trans="overlap">the problem is just</u>
<u n="2487" who="S0241" trans="overlap">the problem the first sentence</u>
<u n="2488" who="S0240" trans="overlap">it's just far too wordy</u>

<u n="2578" who="S0240">this one erm <pause dur="short"/> clarity of questions yes I I hopefully we <trunc>w</trunc> particularly get onto that but the</u>

<u n="2586" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="2587" who="S0241">yeah erm right very good</u>
<u n="2588" who="S0240">and then I'm gonna hand over to my colleague are we having a break or?</u>

<u n="2604" who="S0241">oh <pause dur="long"/> so anyway erm <pause dur="long"/> oh no so I need really I should just put you're using <trunc>internat</trunc> cos you've already done email communication I should really put <trunc>inter</trunc> <trunc>t</trunc> using international English for effective <trunc>meet</trunc> communication in meetings</u>
<u n="2605" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="2606" who="S0241" trans="overlap">shouldn't I and not really mention emails here</u>
<u n="2607" who="S0240">no because I didn't mention <unclear>InterTalk</unclear> cos I don't want to have to explain it</u>
<u n="2608" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2609" who="S0240" trans="overlap">or so cos they'll say what the hell is that?</u>
<u n="2610" who="S0241">erm so this is a summary of it all this second slide er the tips for effective communication so I was just gonna er when I've done this before I'd just leave that there say this is the summary think about and as you're going through just remember this picture and I'll come back to it at the end and it's just er getting them thinking about it as they go through and then we look at the different variety what different varieties of English are there?</u>
<u n="2611" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2612" who="S0241">and so obviously there's all these different ones on the left and then within Britain there's all these different ones and others so the question is whose English should we be using when doing business internationally? and then people have all different views on that should you use oh <trunc>sh</trunc> you know if you phone should I use a north east local accent <trunc>sh</trunc> and I always say it's it's fine to use different accents I would go you know be careful about using dialects and things but if you're speaking clearly and you're aware of your accent and you know cos you know for example I'm from the north east I don't say blood and trouble when I'm talking to people internationally <pause dur="short"/> but I you know tone it down and be aware of it but not</u>
<u n="2613" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2614" who="S0241">not get rid of <trunc>n</trunc>not everybody speaks Queen's English</u>
<u n="2615" who="S0238">no</u>
<u n="2616" who="S0241">and so what's your view on that? but not dialects so I wouldn't say I'm going down the <unclear/> to by myself a paper</u>
<u n="2617" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2618" who="S0240"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2619" who="S0241">in erm Geordie or something</u>
<u n="2620" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="2621" who="S0241">but that people will speak with accents and</u>
<u n="2622" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah it's part of the</u>
<u n="2623" who="S0241">mm mm yeah</u>
<u n="2624" who="S0240" trans="overlap">skill of being an international communicator</u>
<u n="2625" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I mean apart from everything else</u>
<u n="2626" who="S0240" trans="overlap">so you've got to be tolerant of different <trunc>acc</trunc></u>
<u n="2627" who="S0238" trans="overlap">if you try not to you end up producing very weird results</u>
<u n="2628" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="2629" who="S0238">you know like you've ever heard anybody from Yorkshire trying to speak RP</u>
<u n="2630" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="2631" who="S0238">you'd be very often coming a the the hyper-correcting and saying <unclear>cushon</unclear> and things like that it's you know which</u>
<u n="2632" who="S0241" trans="overlap">which just sounds really odd</u>
<u n="2633" who="S0238">yes which just sounds ridiculous</u>
<u n="2634" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="2635" who="S0241">so we ask them what they think about that and then apart from the accent what other difficulties might colleagues have internationally with understanding native speakers when they speak English?</u>
<u n="2636" who="S0240" trans="overlap">what does that say on here?</u>
<u n="2637" who="S0241">that says one minute cos that's er</u>
<u n="2638" who="S0240" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="2639" who="S0241">it's an egg timer</u>
<u n="2640" who="S0240">oh</u>
<u n="2641" who="S0241" trans="overlap">so actually when you've got it on the screen it goes when I click it goes down so they've got a minute to think about that</u>
<u n="2642" who="S0240" trans="overlap">oh I see</u>
<u n="2643" who="S0241">so just have a think about it</u>
<u n="2644" who="S0238" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="2645" who="S0240" trans="overlap">that's clever</u>
<u n="2646" who="S0241">er and then these are some of them so individual sounds the way that sounds get put together in the <trunc>sen</trunc> so individual sounds within a word words themselves and then when the words get put together in a sentence and then culturally specific things which you'd already touched upon</u>
<u n="2647" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2648" who="S0241">and then I just go through them all a little bit so these are the individual sounds and don't worry I'm not gonna go through all of these different sounds here in this picture er and I look at long and short sounds a little bit like shot and short or chip and cheap and how people can't always get that and then er and consonant clusters like comfortable and then individual words and up comes the word look and I say you know what difficulty might people have with a word that's a simple as look? and then people will say oh well it's the same word the pronunciation of it <pause dur="short"/> or they might say it's because it might be look but you've always got the word food so why don't you say look?</u>
<u n="2649" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="2650" who="S0241">some people that would make a problem</u>
<u n="2651" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well you do if you're from Lancashire <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2652" who="S0241">in some places or they might say <trunc>lo</trunc> most of the time what they say is luck as in good luck it's the same pronunciation as</u>
<u n="2653" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="2654" who="S0238" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="2655" who="S0241">so they'll think about that er and then I say yeah what about the word that comes after luck? and how look at look after look for it's a totally different word in most other languages look at is a totally different idea to look for so they've got to listen carefully to what comes after</u>
<u n="2656" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2657" who="S0241">so even a simple word can seem difficult</u>
<u n="2658" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="2659" who="S0241">but then when you started putting it when you start putting speech <trunc>togeth</trunc> words together then it can be really difficult to get so the first one this want to wish you sweet is I'll say well we I was in a meeting once where somebody said a sentence and one of the people heard this and they couldn't understand what was said what do you think was actually said? and then people try to work it out <pause dur="short"/> and then the <trunc>sec</trunc> I bring the second one up that starts <unclear>this one</unclear> and say another person with the same sentence heard this and they try to guess what was actually said and then actually what was said was the last one</u>
<u n="2660" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2661" who="S0241">so it's just knowing you know you might the last one the words are not difficult but sometimes when you're listening to a foreign language</u>
<u n="2662" who="S0240" trans="overlap">it's not just it's</u>
<u n="2663" who="S0241" trans="overlap">it's hard to know where one word ends and the next word begins</u>
<u n="2664" who="S0240">so what's the advice or does that come <trunc>late</trunc> oh yeah tips I mean</u>
<u n="2665" who="S0241" trans="overlap">the advice comes later</u>
<u n="2666" who="S0240" trans="overlap">I mean would you not give them like how can you avoid you know creating that problem for people?</u>
<u n="2667" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I don't think I think if I start giving them tips and going back and forwards</u>
<u n="2668" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2669" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2670" who="S0241" trans="overlap">it just becomes</u>
<u n="2671" who="S0240">okay</u>
<u n="2672" who="S0241">very</u>
<u n="2673" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="2674" who="S0241">bitty</u>
<u n="2675" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="2676" who="S0241">I think it's <trunc>ra</trunc> I'd rather first of all</u>
<u n="2677" who="S0240" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="2678" who="S0241">say what the issue make them aware of the issues and then look at things</u>

<u n="2681" who="S0241">and then and look at sometimes I don't do this one but which one do you actually hear?</u>

<u n="2683" who="S0240">right</u>
<u n="2684" who="S0241" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and and and things and it's just an awareness really a bit of fun but a bit of awareness that it is quite difficult to know where one word ends and one where one word begins things that seem very simple er can be quite difficult and actually <trunc>y</trunc> you could pronounce all of those A and B both the same</u>
<u n="2685" who="S0240">yeah</u>

<u n="2687" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="2688" who="S0241">er and so then to practice that a bit more about when <trunc>w</trunc> is the next one so we've written it <trunc>li</trunc> the first one is where d'you live?</u>
<u n="2689" who="S0240">where d'you live</u>
<u n="2690" who="S0241">and the third one's very difficult of course and then ain't it hot isn't it hot and people like say ain't it hot in 'ere or isn't it hot</u>
<u n="2691" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah mm</u>
<u n="2692" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and and to think you know people we all say this kind of thing well you know not necessarily all of these but people say this kind of thing all the time</u>
<u n="2693" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2694" who="S0241">and it's really difficult for people to pick up on it sometimes er and then culturally specific or specialist vocabularies so abbreviations and I don't need to say a lot about this cos this has already been touched upon elsewhere</u>
<u n="2695" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2696" who="S0241">but the specialist vocabulary people might know about but and then there's four examples here how might you say them and just like to jot down the number I give them a ring or shall I run through that again</u>
<u n="2697" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2698" who="S0241" trans="overlap">so a phrasal verb is not that I use that word or using abbreviations like CEO or let's get down to the nitty-gritty which we it came up before</u>
<u n="2699" who="S0240" trans="overlap">I put that on cos you gave it to me</u>
<u n="2700" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2701" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2702" who="S0241" trans="overlap">that's good</u>
<u n="2703" who="S0240" trans="overlap">but if you want I can change it</u>
<u n="2704" who="S0238">no no that's fine</u>
<event desc="unintelligible"/>
<u n="2705" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="2706" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="2707" who="S0241">and people speak either with a very monotone fast or too <trunc>fa</trunc> and then bearing in mind with cultural specific things that there's a <trunc>diff</trunc> apart from the different business culture which you've mentioned there's also the fact that we talk a lot in in everyday speech and in work about business celebrities</u>
<u n="2708" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="2709" who="S0241">or famous people and people that are well known in one culture are not necessarily well known in another one</u>
<u n="2710" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2711" who="S0241">and people that you just assume everybody knows are not always known so David Beckham might be quite well known in Japan</u>
<u n="2712" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2713" who="S0241">but other people that we know really well like off the Friends television programme or from the X Factor or that some of these famous people singers people don't know sometimes it's based on some culturally specific things they're just <trunc>s</trunc> simply from before</u>
<u n="2714" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2715" who="S0241">the student that the person's time that you're talking to</u>
<u n="2716" who="S0238">yes <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2717" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="2718" who="S0238">you need to know how old people are</u>
<u n="2719" who="S0241">yeah and so erm or it's based got sometimes you can you end up talking about things which are very based on life here and it's not erm people just don't get it cos it's</u>
<u n="2720" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I have a problem with when I'm watching comedy shows on <trunc>tele</trunc> I mean comedy chat shows now</u>
<u n="2721" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="2722" who="S0238">because <pause dur="short"/> quite often there'll be jokes that refer to <trunc>peo</trunc>people from popular culture and I've no idea who they are because I don't watch enough television</u>
<u n="2723" who="S0241">mm yeah no I have that problem</u>
<u n="2724" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and I actually gradually deduced who some of these people are from the jokes that are made about them but I don't actually know</u>
<u n="2725" who="S0241">yeah and so it's you know there's <trunc>peo</trunc> you can't assume that things that everybody just knows</u>
<u n="2726" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2727" who="S0241">and aren't known in other cultures so what vocabulary do you have and a match I was gonna a bit of that but there might not be time and then the tips for effective communication are here in a list and I <pause dur="short"/> I go through them one by one</u>
<u n="2728" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2729" who="S0241">but er and we just talk about them all</u>
<u n="2730" who="S0240">yeah it's good</u>
<u n="2731" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2732" who="S0241" trans="overlap">it's what I've done in the past and <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="2733" who="S0240" trans="overlap">what's that that one sorry what was the suggestion?</u>
<u n="2734" who="S0241" trans="overlap">oh that's just here are some suggestions</u>

<u n="2736" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and then just go onto it</u>
<u n="2737" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2738" who="S0241" trans="overlap">so it's quick and then I bring up those original pictures again with the blanks here and really what I'm doing is I'm testing them on what I just said on the slide before which is a bit vocabulary it's word dense</u>
<u n="2739" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="2740" who="S0241" trans="overlap">so really I'm just testing them on the same things again</u>
<u n="2741" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="2742" who="S0241">so I say what do you think then this picture? and they don't have to get the right answer it doesn't matter it just makes them think <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2743" who="S0238">yeah</u>
<u n="2744" who="S0241" trans="overlap">it makes them activates gonna ask you about what we've just said doesn't it?</u>

<u n="2753" who="S0241">doesn't really matter what the <trunc>pic</trunc> in a way it's kind of just met them thinking get about it again so vocalise so don't don't be <trunc>monoto</trunc> don't speak with a really <trunc>mono</trunc> if you if you have a tendency to mumble don't mumble and erm to be or not to be <trunc>kee</trunc>keep sentences short and precise which you've said things about this don't make things over-complex avoid negative questions and double negatives we can talk about as well</u>
<u n="2754" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="2755" who="S0241">er use frequently used vocabulary like chair instead of you know and so call the spade a spade in effect er have regular breaks in meetings because and a cup of tea or coffee have breaks cos it's very difficult to work in a foreign language all the time</u>

<u n="2763" who="S0240">mm</u>

<u n="2765" who="S0240">mm</u>

<u n="2930" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I think we will just use double sided won't we?</u>
<u n="2931" who="S0240">oh think so</u>
<u n="2932" who="S0241">yeah erm</u>
<u n="2933" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I mean that one is only single sided</u>
<u n="2934" who="S0241">yeah</u>
<u n="2935" who="S0238">and I think that's fair enough</u>
<u n="2936" who="S0241">that would be <trunc>sing</trunc> that would be single then</u>
<u n="2937" who="S0240" trans="overlap">why couldn't that go on the back of that one? there was</u>
<u n="2938" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well no cos I think that looks a bit cheap</u>
<u n="2939" who="S0241">cos cos it looks cheap if you</u>
<u n="2940" who="S0240" trans="overlap">does it?</u>
<u n="2941" who="S0241">cos it's not the same exercise at all</u>

<u n="2952" who="S0238" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="2953" who="S0241" trans="overlap">this is where it's probably why I was asking it really cos <pause dur="short"/> I don't think we should have it for the sake you know for the sake of</u>

<u n="2955" who="S0241" trans="overlap">a few pieces of paper</u>

<u n="3016" who="S0240">but at least they can refer to it you know</u>

<u n="3023" who="S0240" trans="overlap">I do I do</u>
<u n="3024" who="S0241">it costs them a fortune to print it</u>

<u n="3040" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="3041" who="S0238">but I do think a business environment is a bit different <pause dur="short"/> and it is partly about presentation</u>

<u n="3047" who="S0241">no but I do think that this one</u>

<u n="3049" who="S0241">should be</u>

<u n="3055" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3056" who="S0241">cos it's one handout</u>
<u n="3057" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="3058" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3059" who="S0238">yes if it's <trunc>hand</trunc></u>
<u n="3060" who="S0241">yeah</u>

<u n="3064" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3065" who="S0238">rather than a</u>
<u n="3066" who="S0240" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="3067" who="S0238" trans="overlap">an odd number</u>
<u n="3068" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3069" who="S0238" trans="overlap">because it it works out quite <unclear/></u>
<u n="3070" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and actually on this one I did kind of put something on the back cos I thought well if I'm gonna handout one side I might as well put something</u>

<u n="3072" who="S0241" trans="overlap">on the back of it that that you're not <trunc>nee</trunc></u>

<u n="3075" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="3076" who="S0241">but I will add this this</u>

<u n="3088" who="S0241">erm we need to think about in what we're gonna do if we'll keep working on our bits and then maybe</u>
<u n="3089" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="3090" who="S0241" trans="overlap">have one more meeting but and about payment for you</u>

<u n="3092" who="S0241">so are you adding up some <trunc>ti</trunc></u>
<u n="3093" who="S0240">well</u>
<u n="3094" who="S0241" trans="overlap">you know you need to think about time and how much</u>

<u n="3100" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3101" who="S0241">cos we can't do that because we don't get paid extra for it anyway</u>
<u n="3102" who="S0240" trans="overlap">you don't get paid extra anyway well I don't know you must have had an idea of from whatever you get I I can try and add it up like</u>
<u n="3103" who="S0241" trans="overlap">I have no concept</u>
<u n="3104" who="S0240">I mean but the thing is it's not a sudden all in one block like today for example I went into work at whatever time ten or something</u>
<u n="3105" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="3106" who="S0240">and then I did a lot of other stuff and then I started properly about twelve</u>
<u n="3107" who="S0241">yeah well you need to think about</u>
<u n="3108" who="S0240" trans="overlap">twelve one two three</u>
<u n="3109" who="S0241" trans="overlap">how much money you want paying for it</u>
<u n="3110" who="S0240">you know</u>
<u n="3111" who="S0241">how many hours</u>
<u n="3112" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I mean the each of the meetings that we've <trunc>ha</trunc></u>
<u n="3113" who="S0240" trans="overlap">and some of the other ones I've spent longer on yeah</u>
<u n="3114" who="S0238" trans="overlap">have been about two hours I mean</u>
<u n="3115" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah they have yeah</u>
<u n="3116" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you see you know erm</u>
<u n="3117" who="S0240">so how many meetings have we had? three?</u>
<u n="3118" who="S0241">three?</u>
<u n="3119" who="S0240">three</u>
<u n="3120" who="S0241">so that's six hours</u>
<u n="3121" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3122" who="S0238" trans="overlap">but then obviously the time that you've spent on your own</u>
<u n="3123" who="S0240">yes</u>
<u n="3124" who="S0241">you have to work out for yourself</u>
<u n="3125" who="S0240">okay</u>
<u n="3126" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah so have a think about it</u>
<u n="3127" who="S0240">I will yeah</u>
<u n="3128" who="S0241">but you know it might be <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> and then to claim it</u>
<u n="3129" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3130" who="S0241">we need to check with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> again but she did tell me something about this she says she said you either claim like say it's taken you fourteen hours or something</u>
<u n="3131" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3132" who="S0241">right? well then you either claim it as at the meeting rate</u>
<u n="3133" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="3134" who="S0241">fourteen hours at the meeting rate cos the meeting rate is a sixty minute hour isn't it?</u>
<u n="3135" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="3136" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3137" who="S0241">so er fourteen hours at the meeting rate or you claim it at you claim something like seven hours at the teaching rate</u>
<u n="3138" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3139" who="S0241">something cos you claim half as many cos it's for every hour that for teaching you're getting paid for preparing and marking as well</u>
<u n="3140" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3141" who="S0241">so you're kind of getting another hour on top of it</u>
<u n="3142" who="S0238">right yeah yeah</u>
<u n="3143" who="S0241">so so it's something like you either claim fourteen hours at the meeting rate or half as many hours I think it is</u>
<u n="3144" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3145" who="S0241">at the teaching rate and one of those works out slightly better for you</u>
<u n="3146" who="S0240">okay</u>
<u n="3147" who="S0238">so do the maths and <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3148" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="3149" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3150" who="S0241"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> knows this cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s done it before with people</u>
<u n="3151" who="S0240">yeah</u>
<u n="3152" who="S0241">so she like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s done things for</u>
<u n="3153" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3154" who="S0241" trans="overlap">lots of project stuff so she'll know</u>
<u n="3155" who="S0240" trans="overlap">I'll ask <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I'll ask <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> yeah</u>
<u n="3156" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but what you'll need to know before you ask <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is how many hours you've spent on it</u>
<u n="3157" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yeah okay</u>
<u n="3158" who="S0241" trans="overlap">and it would be useful if you told us that cos then if she said to me or <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> how long has it taken <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> then we can all sing from the same hymn sheet</u>
<u n="3159" who="S0240">ah</u>
<u n="3160" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="3161" who="S0240">okay</u>
<u n="3162" who="S0241">cos if she says to us make us guess</u>
<u n="3163" who="S0240">but I haven't been writing it down because</u>
<u n="3164" who="S0241">mm</u>
<u n="3165" who="S0240">you get involved in it don't you and you start reading up on stuff</u>
<u n="3166" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well I mean our answer to that is we know how long we've spent in meetings but we don't know how long she's taken on on working the</u>
<u n="3167" who="S0241" trans="overlap">yeah on the rest of it</u>
<u n="3168" who="S0240">no</u>
<u n="3169" who="S0238">the work why should we?</u>
<u n="3170" who="S0241" trans="overlap">but she she might ask us what do we think is reasonable and it would be handy for us to know</u>
<u n="3171" who="S0240">mm</u>
<u n="3172" who="S0241" trans="overlap">what you've thought about before</u>
<u n="3173" who="S0240" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="3174" who="S0241">before we get</u>
