<u n="91" who="S0511">on your watch</u>
<u n="92" who="S0512" trans="overlap">because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was too busy reflecting to count the time</u>

<u n="94" who="S0512"><unclear/></u>
<u n="95" who="S0511">what did you think about?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0513">I thought it was bloody stupid</u>

<u n="98" who="S0513">happened ages ago <unclear/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0511">happened ages ago what? so therefore it's no longer relevant?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0512"><unclear/></u>
<u n="101" who="S0513">essentially and it gets me really annoyed because people say oh we've if we hadn't won the war then we wouldn't be here today</u>
<u n="102" who="S0511">yeah which is annoying</u>
<u n="103" who="S0512" trans="overlap">that is very irritating</u>
<u n="104" who="S0511">and I also find the language used I was just looking at the BBC news headlines <unclear>the other day it was talking of</unclear> people remembering the fallen like all this ridiculous language the fallen you know and why don't you what are you talking about? people who died in the war yeah I find that <unclear>irritating</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> but you know actually I did I do er at the weekend in my <unclear/> French weekend this weekend there was a woman there who has done lots of conflict resolution peace building stuff in war-torn areas of the world</u>
<u n="105" who="S0512">mm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0511">and she wants to set up a <unclear>social venture now</unclear> to try and scale some of the stuff and I was talking to her about how can it be that human beings we're quite clever at stuff and we do know things about how to tell <trunc>peop</trunc> resolve conflict or resolve dispute and yet we're so busy building fucking phones that we're not doing this stuff and it's just absurd that we're not more further advanced</u>
<u n="107" who="S0512"><unclear>mm</unclear></u>
<u n="108" who="S0511">but she told me an interesting thing which I've never thought about that erm <pause dur="short"/> in many many many conflicts in the world you cannot bring the two sides together and that's true you know in <unclear>arguments in life</unclear> as well</u>
<u n="109" who="S0513" trans="overlap"><unclear/> religion's fault</u>
<u n="110" who="S0511">sorry darling?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0513">that's religion's fault</u>
<u n="112" who="S0511">that's religion's fault <unclear>rather</unclear> well yeah for whatever reason erm but you see the principles of most conflict resolutions and the first thing you do is get both sides in the room so if you can't do that then you're kind of buggered before you start she explained and so therefore you have to have ways where you can solve a conflict by only working with one side and that's a lot of the work that she's done in various <unclear>different regions</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> which is when I used to say to you we you can't argue if you stop arguing back then the other one can't argue it's <unclear/> <unclear>argue</unclear> <unclear/> it's the same</u>
<u n="113" who="S0513">we had a fun last lesson today because we watched football on the field</u>
