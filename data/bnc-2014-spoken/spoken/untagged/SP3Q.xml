<u n="72" who="S0530">despite it you've felt like this for a long time doesn't mean you're <pause dur="short"/> like <pause dur="short"/> a lost cause it doesn't mean that <trunc>y</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> you know you can be experiencing something for a long time and feeling a certain way but it doesn't mean you should <pause dur="short"/> well you feel more inclined to give up but</u>
<u n="73" who="S0529" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="74" who="S0530">you know?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0530">cos I guess I guess it is easier if say like <pause dur="short"/> it's been like a sudden slide <pause dur="short"/> but with you it hasn't really has it? like you've felt like this for a while</u>
<u n="77" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="78" who="S0530">and you've had a lot of time <trunc>f</trunc> like to yourself which is gonna make it kind of more difficult <pause dur="short"/> to get back <trunc>int</trunc> like <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> like for you now like <pause dur="short"/> the abnormal is normal</u>
<u n="79" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0530">so like not doing is the norm <pause dur="short"/> which isn't your fault at all</u>
<u n="81" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><unclear>I know what you mean</unclear></u>
<u n="82" who="S0530">because <pause dur="short"/> literally like <pause dur="short"/> I've been there and it's</u>
<u n="83" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0530">horrible because you can't do anything <pause dur="short"/> like even if you try</u>
<u n="85" who="S0529" trans="overlap">I know I I'm really wanted to like <pause dur="short"/> kill myself earlier <pause dur="short"/> like honestly <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0530">oh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="87" who="S0529">but it just <pause dur="short"/> it's just so stupid as well like there's just no reason to think like that</u>
<u n="88" who="S0530" trans="overlap">it's not stupid</u>
<u n="89" who="S0529">cos I mean I do think like that and it's fine cos I don't</u>
<u n="90" who="S0530" trans="overlap">cos it affects it it all affects your brain yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0529" whoConfidence="low">I know</u>
<u n="92" who="S0529">it really does it must do because it's just like <trunc>n</trunc> there's no logical reason for you to be thinking like that otherwise <pause dur="short"/> you know? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="93" who="S0530">cos if you think about it like <pause dur="short"/> you know? <pause dur="short"/> it's <pause dur="short"/> it's an impairment</u>
<u n="94" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0530">it's a disability like <pause dur="short"/> it's <pause dur="short"/> stops you from functioning normally and <pause dur="short"/> not normally but you know what I mean it it stops you from functioning as you would be if you were healthy</u>
<u n="96" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0530">you know? <pause dur="short"/> and that's hard <pause dur="short"/> it's not to say that you can't be healthy again but like <pause dur="short"/> this isn't how it's gonna be <pause dur="short"/> for ever and ever <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> to actually get rid of it <pause dur="short"/> well not get rid of it but to be able to control it and get into like a stage where you can cope with it <pause dur="short"/> or even see it as maybe less <pause dur="short"/> powerful than it is <pause dur="short"/> you know? <pause dur="short"/> like I know it's quite like typical to say oh yeah you just have to beat it I'm not that kind of person that's like <pause dur="short"/> you have to push past this</u>
<u n="98" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0530">and you have to keep trying <pause dur="short"/> but <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>then</unclear> like <pause dur="short"/> the more you let it kind of <pause dur="short"/> the thing is like <pause dur="short"/> it it makes you think that it's you that doesn't wanna do anything</u>
<u n="100" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0530">which is really horrible isn't it because like?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0529">I feel like it's my fault and I don't know whether that is true or not</u>
<u n="103" who="S0530" trans="overlap">it's not your fault</u>
<u n="104" who="S0529">like I really don't any more <pause dur="short"/> like the way my family were like like talking to me it sounded <pause dur="short"/> as though it was my fault <pause dur="short"/> and then I felt really awful about it and that's when I was like</u>
<u n="105" who="S0530">I mean from the outside <pause dur="short"/> people do think <pause dur="short"/> well people can think it's your fault because <pause dur="short"/> the symptoms of it are just like <pause dur="short"/> you don't want to do things</u>
<u n="106" who="S0529" trans="overlap">I think it is</u>
<u n="107" who="S0530">but it's how is it your how is your fault that you feel like this?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0529">I don't know because this is just how I am like I've just this is just my personality now it's not even <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't even feel like it's <pause dur="short"/> you know there's something wrong with my brain it's just the way I am</u>
<u n="109" who="S0530">I think you can be a cynical person</u>
<u n="110" who="S0529"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="111" who="S0530">and be able to get out of bed and be able to feel able to do things I don't think <pause dur="short"/> there's correlation that much correlation there I think <pause dur="short"/> you can be somebody that <pause dur="short"/> like it's not I don't <trunc>i</trunc> I don't think it's just because you might have a negative view of things</u>
<u n="112" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="113" who="S0530">like it might help <trunc>sometime</trunc> like it might've contributed to it but I'm I'm certain that <pause dur="short"/> just because like you're maybe not as like <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> you've got such <pause dur="short"/> like a spiritual outlook of the world some people have <pause dur="short"/> you know? <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't it doesn't mean that like <pause dur="short"/> you know? <pause dur="short"/> cos it's not it's not part of your personality to be <pause dur="short"/> like <pause dur="short"/> constantly like upset and constantly worried <pause dur="short"/> like <pause dur="short"/> outside factors contribute to that <pause dur="short"/> it's not just like oh I'm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> so I'm like this <pause dur="short"/> it's not <pause dur="short"/> and I know <trunc>h</trunc>how it just it just feels permanent and it sucks but it's not <pause dur="short"/> I mean <trunc>u</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> like you've said that over summer you didn't feel very good <pause dur="short"/> like when you were at home <pause dur="short"/> like did <trunc>y</trunc> did it feel <pause dur="short"/> it <trunc>di</trunc> obviously didn't feel very good but did it feel like less stressful than this because you didn't actually have responsibility then or <pause dur="short"/> were your family onto you so it was pretty hard?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0529">I mean it was stressful in a different way like it was</u>
<u n="115" who="S0530">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0529">erm the stakes are a lot higher <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0530">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0529">you know if I get <pause dur="short"/> if if things fall apart here then like that's just really bad because</u>
<u n="119" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0529">you know there's a lot of money involved here and there are a lot of serious</u>
<u n="121" who="S0530" trans="overlap">oh god <pause dur="short"/> there's definitely a lot of money</u>
<u n="122" who="S0529" trans="overlap">important things involved here <pause dur="short"/> like that would be affected if I decided to fuck things up which I have done <pause dur="short"/> but whereas at home it was like if I <pause dur="short"/> if I like acted out or something the only thing that would <pause dur="short"/> affect would be like my family</u>
<u n="123" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0529">and that did upset me but it didn't <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>w</trunc> no it did stress me out but like like <trunc>who</trunc> like in a different way like <pause dur="short"/> yeah I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I just feel like I'm gonna feel like this wherever I go <vocal desc="laugh"/> really <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and I'm always gonna have the same pressure from my family</u>
<u n="125" who="S0530">do they want you to do really well or do they just want you to do stuff all the time?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0529"><vocal desc="sigh"/> I don't I don't even know any more</u>
<u n="127" who="S0530" trans="overlap">is that what?</u>
<u n="128" who="S0529">they want me to do well up here cos they think I can</u>
<u n="129" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0529">they think I have it in me and I really don't <pause dur="short"/> it's not <unclear>there</unclear></u>
<u n="131" who="S0530">it isn't <unclear>fair</unclear></u>
<u n="132" who="S0529">it <pause dur="short"/> cos</u>
<u n="133" who="S0530" trans="overlap">cos it's not that you're not capable of getting <pause dur="short"/> good grades that you're not smart it's because right now you're not in the right position to be able to apply yourself</u>
<u n="134" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0530">that isn't <pause dur="short"/> it's not fair and it's not that is not your fault</u>
<u n="136" who="S0529"><vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="137" who="S0530">and maybe when you actually start getting like proper regular help <pause dur="short"/> and let it kick in a bit</u>
<u n="138" who="S0529">no but that's just not happening here it's just not happening it's like I</u>
<u n="139" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="140" who="S0529"><vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> if I made another appointment it would take a week at least</u>
<u n="141" who="S0530">to actually? <pause dur="short"/> are they not like <unclear>putting</unclear> regular slots in or anything like that?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0529" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="143" who="S0530">why?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0529">well cos <trunc>o</trunc>on on Friday I went to like the acute <pause dur="short"/> kind of thing because <pause dur="short"/> that's the only way you can get a faster appointment at the doctor's <pause dur="short"/> so I did that and I went to see a nurse <pause dur="short"/> and then she <pause dur="short"/> made me <trunc>appoi</trunc> an appointment for yesterday which I obviously missed</u>
<u n="145" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="146" who="S0529">and that's the problem like <pause dur="short"/> and I haven't called them back because I don't have any signal and I haven't been outside but if I were to call them back they would tell me like this is when the next appointment's available <pause dur="short"/> or you'd have to go through the <pause dur="short"/> acute team again</u>
<u n="147" who="S0530">oh my god</u>
<u n="148" who="S0529" trans="overlap">and <pause dur="short"/> back to where you came from and it's just</u>
<u n="149" who="S0530">that's crazy</u>
<u n="150" who="S0529" trans="overlap">it's just straight back to square one and it's really frustrating <pause dur="short"/> and they don't give you like <pause dur="short"/> repeat appointments like all the time <pause dur="short"/> and the counselling appointment's like once every Friday</u>
<u n="151" who="S0530" trans="overlap">oh god</u>
<u n="152" who="S0529">and it's like why would you put it at the end of the week you know? it's just fucking stupid <pause dur="short"/> I get one appointment every week <pause dur="short"/> and it's on Friday <pause dur="short"/> and it's with a woman who wants me to</u>
<u n="153" who="S0530">leave?</u>
<u n="154" who="S0529">to leave</u>
<u n="155" who="S0530">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0529">and also like <pause dur="short"/> do CBT like try things during the week that I just can't cope with most of the time because I'm too worried about everything else and it's just not helpful</u>
<u n="157" who="S0530" trans="overlap">what's the sort of thing she asks you to do?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0529"><vocal desc="sigh"/> I don't know so even like difficult stuff it's just basic things like getting out of bed and <pause dur="short"/> eating properly and going for walks <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> and it's just not helpful at the minute</u>
<u n="159" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="160" who="S0529">it's not what I want</u>
<u n="161" who="S0530">I think <pause dur="short"/> a bad of it <pause dur="short"/> well the part of that's probably <pause dur="short"/> really hard is that like it feels <pause dur="short"/> like there's too much now to actually control</u>

<u n="367" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="368" who="S0530">they <trunc>al</trunc> they always are but I think that it's because <pause dur="short"/> I literally have said to myself <pause dur="short"/> I think my moment was when I was just not being able to do my work and I was just like <pause dur="short"/> nothing can be worse by just <pause dur="short"/> than like the way I am now like</u>
<u n="369" who="S0529">yeah</u>

<u n="374" who="S0530">and feel even more of a failure because I'll never know what I actually would've got in the <pause dur="short"/> assignment <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I just hope that regularly <pause dur="short"/> doing work will exercise my brain and</u>

<u n="378" who="S0530">like see it as <pause dur="short"/> kind of growth rather than like <pause dur="short"/> something that'll burn me out <pause dur="short"/> and not pushing myself too hard as well because <pause dur="short"/> you know you've gotta be gentle <pause dur="short"/> like you've gotta be firm but you've gotta be gentle</u>

<u n="381" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="382" who="S0530">but also too little as well like you can <trunc>alway</trunc> you can never really tell what <pause dur="short"/> cos you've gotta get a balance in on it and I think that is hard especially at uni because <pause dur="short"/> there is no well except me <pause dur="short"/> and people in the flat there is nobody telling you <pause dur="short"/> what to do here</u>
<u n="383" who="S0529">yeah</u>
<u n="384" who="S0530">which and I think independence when you're depressed can be the most damaging thing you know? <pause dur="short"/> like obviously there are people like emailing you and shit but it's not direct nobody's coming and hammering on your door and saying <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> get out of bed you know? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="464" who="S0530">okay</u>

<u n="485" who="S0530" trans="overlap">might be able to do it <unclear>through there</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> cos it's one thousand two hundred and <pause dur="short"/> thirty or something yeah</u>
<u n="486" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah to like use it for your <pause dur="short"/> accommodation as well</u>
<u n="487" who="S0530">mm</u>
