<u n="76" who="S0655">yeah that's quite difficult</u>
<u n="77" who="S0653">no you just you just erm you just get used to used to doing them but it's it has been useful to be able to read music than learning the drums</u>
<u n="78" who="S0655">uhu <pause dur="short"/> I'm starting to learn</u>
<u n="79" who="S0653">mm <pause dur="short"/> well it helps but it's not essential the way <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s teaching us luckily</u>
<u n="80" who="S0655">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0653">yeah and then we'll do the circus on Monday I think because it's supposed to be horrible weather again</u>

<u n="91" who="S0653">I know hopefully there will be people on the trapeze and the high wire and maybe there will be a hoop</u>
<u n="92" who="S0654">people riding people riding horses</u>
<u n="93" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0655">that's animal cruelty</u>
<u n="95" who="S0653">mm there is a website so I will go and have a look</u>
<u n="96" who="S0655">I'd like it as a surprise mum</u>
<u n="97" who="S0653">I would like it to be a surprise <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I think we'll enjoy it</u>
<u n="98" who="S0654">mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0655">well</u>
<u n="100" who="S0653">now there's erm</u>
<u n="101" who="S0655">they do treat animals very meanly in the circus</u>
<u n="102" who="S0653">not any more no they can't they are not allowed to</u>
<u n="103" who="S0655">they still use the whips</u>
<u n="104" who="S0653">no they don't how do you know?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0655">because I read it in a book</u>
<u n="106" who="S0653">which book?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0655">Bart Simpson Big Shot</u>
<u n="108" who="S0653">they are not allowed to do that sort of thing they are very very strict rules about animals these days I mean I would prefer to go to a circus that doesn't have animals in it and there might not be one might not be any</u>
<u n="109" who="S0654" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> there was one</u>
<u n="110" who="S0653">what</u>
<u n="111" who="S0654">when a long time ago when we were at the <anon type="place"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="112" who="S0653">you went to one okay</u>
<u n="113" who="S0654">there was a circus with no animals at all no lion taming no riding horses just</u>
<u n="114" who="S0653" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> sorry</u>
<u n="115" who="S0654">no lion taming no horses just er just there wasn't just all</u>
<u n="116" who="S0653">just what?</u>
<u n="117" who="S0654">just people</u>
<u n="118" who="S0653">just people</u>
<u n="119" who="S0654">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0653">can you remember what they were doing?</u>
<u n="121" who="S0654">well one person was climbing up a rope and attaching themself to it and it was like with a key or something and he actually untied himself with no hands</u>
<u n="122" who="S0653" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> very impressive</u>
<u n="123" who="S0655">is lion taming cruelty? when they go <vocal desc="misc"/> <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="124" who="S0653">yeah I think it is I mean if if they're well treated I don't think they do that now</u>
<u n="125" who="S0655">because anyway you could die doing lion taming</u>
<u n="126" who="S0653">yeah you can do if the animals turn and get nasty</u>
<u n="127" who="S0655">you can die doing quite a lot of things in the circus</u>
<u n="128" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0654">like fire breathing</u>
<u n="130" who="S0653">well you take special precautions for that kind of thing</u>
<u n="131" who="S0655">being a tightrope and trapeze you can easily die</u>
<u n="132" who="S0653">there's always a safety net underneath</u>
<u n="133" who="S0654">can we see the bears?</u>
<u n="134" who="S0653">can you see the bears? can you start talking with your mouth</u>
<u n="135" who="S0654" trans="overlap">can you please move the bear so I can see it?</u>
<u n="136" who="S0653">yeah in a moment I'm eating at the moment what I was going to say was in the summer there is this juggling it's not just juggling but a a kind of a weekend in the <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> where you can camp and go and do some juggling and I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will be doing the trapeze and there is a game of erm a tent of games of board games croquet and I thought that would be quite a fun thing to do that weekend what do you guys think? <pause dur="long"/> yes no? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="137" who="S0655">well did you say that's a week or a weekend?</u>
<u n="138" who="S0653">just a weekend</u>
<u n="139" who="S0655">mm well</u>
<u n="140" who="S0653">you get to watch a lot of people do juggling as well</u>
<u n="141" who="S0655">I did enjoy it our last holiday weekend we had</u>
<u n="142" who="S0653">what was that one?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0655">the one where we went to the <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="144" who="S0653">where?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0655">the <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="146" who="S0653">oh when we went erm in <anon type="place"/> what was it called? <anon type="place"/> that that lovely house?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0655">yeah you also like the smashing ice I feel that somebody should have hidden the key in there</u>
<u n="148" who="S0653" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> what for the next people to come?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0655">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0653">that would have been mean</u>
<u n="151" who="S0655">the key is in the freezing cold water</u>
<u n="152" who="S0653">now erm we are not so far away from this juggling thing so we could probably just go for one day <pause dur="short"/> or stay somewhere else or go camping what do you fancy?</u>
<u n="153" who="S0654">stay for one day</u>
<u n="154" who="S0655">or maybe two if we decide that we like it a lot</u>
<u n="155" who="S0653">mm mm that's a good way of thinking what do you think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0654">pardon?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0653">have you not been listening?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0654">no</u>
<u n="159" who="S0653">we are talking about the juggling weekend in the <trunc>s</trunc> in the summer it's in around half-term in May and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was saying that we could although we can camp there maybe we will plan on going for one day and then if we like it then we can go back the next day</u>
<u n="160" who="S0654">okay</u>
<u n="161" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0655">and if we can't juggle that well</u>
<u n="163" who="S0653">well I can't juggle at all</u>
<u n="164" who="S0655">I want to repeatedly learn how to I want to learn how to repeatedly juggle three balls</u>
<u n="165" who="S0654">I can do this with <unclear/> mum</u>
<u n="166" who="S0653">don't talk over <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="167" who="S0654">I can catch one ball I can do two <unclear/> and then can I have three</u>
<u n="168" who="S0655">can I have a slice of tiger bread?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0653" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> no you can't have three slices of tiger bread</u>
<u n="170" who="S0654">can I have two</u>
<u n="171" who="S0653">that's a giant slice anyway isn't it</u>
<u n="172" who="S0654">mm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0655">it's one <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0654"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0653">mm I think they do lots of classes but they it's erm we would be just be going for one weekend but the the actual thing lasts for eleven days and then at the second weekend they do they put on a performance but you will be with dad that weekend and in fact I'm not around</u>
<u n="176" who="S0655" trans="overlap">eleven days? <pause dur="short"/> oh and that's three days less than in than in two entire weeks</u>
<u n="177" who="S0653">what do you mean? mm that's a very odd way of thinking about it but yes</u>
<u n="178" who="S0655"><unclear/> in less than two weeks</u>
<u n="179" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="180" who="S0655">it's more than a week though</u>
<u n="181" who="S0653">it's nearly it's nearly two weeks isn't it?</u>
<u n="182" who="S0655">yeah so you don't have three <trunc>da</trunc> if we went there for the whole time you'd only have three days left of the the holidays</u>
<u n="183" who="S0654">mm mm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0653">oh are you enjoying your tiger bread?</u>
<u n="185" who="S0654"><vocal desc="misc"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> look how thick this slice is that is three no maybe four slices thick</u>
<u n="186" who="S0655">probably two</u>
<u n="187" who="S0654">no</u>
<u n="188" who="S0653">I think the thing about jugglers <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is that they get obsessed about it so they want that that would be probably their holiday</u>
<u n="189" who="S0655">I guess so</u>
<u n="190" who="S0653">which is understandable</u>
<u n="191" who="S0655">no erm because sometimes juggling can actually come in handy if you want because if there's something where you need to carry three balls across a big bridge but you're only able to hold hold one er two at a time and people would steal the <trunc>sil</trunc> the balls if you come back for one juggling is the only way to complete it</u>
<u n="192" who="S0653" trans="overlap">uhu <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> do you think this is something that would crop up in life?</u>
