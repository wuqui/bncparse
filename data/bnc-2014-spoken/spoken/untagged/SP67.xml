<u n="128" who="S0037">I hope not</u>
<u n="129" who="S0115">uh yeah <anon type="place"/>'s a good place although I feel like it's quite far for a lot of people to travel</u>
<u n="130" who="S0037">I think it's just because</u>
<u n="131" who="S0115">I don't know how many people <trunc>u</trunc> of us are actually there</u>
<u n="132" who="S0037">I dunno <pause dur="short"/> chris was like who we gonna invite? and I was like urr and he was like well we sort of kinda have to invite everyone if it's like the ten year anniversary</u>
<u n="133" who="S0115" trans="overlap">anyway <pause dur="short"/> but I but like almost everybody's far away from there though aren't they?</u>
<u n="134" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I know</u>
<u n="135" who="S0115">so it's it has a sort of logistical problem uh I think</u>
<u n="136" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah but it's just the sort of fun of going somewhere I think that's part of the thing <pause dur="short"/> cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was like oh we'll all go from London together and party train and</u>
<u n="137" who="S0115">I suppose so</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="138" who="S0037">so</u>
<u n="139" who="S0115">um</u>
<u n="140" who="S0037">anyway</u>
<u n="141" who="S0115">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'll uh <pause dur="short"/> get some more in a minute</u>
<u n="142" who="S0037">hmm?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0115">I'll have some more in a minute um</u>
<u n="144" who="S0037">it was really nice</u>
<u n="145" who="S0115">so I took so it was like uh made by partly by accident cos I made the sort of</u>
<u n="146" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0115">like the main  the main  meat and potato bit and mixed them together and realized it was only half full</u>
<u n="148" who="S0037">fish and potato did you not mean?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0115">meat and uh and fish and potato uh</u>
<u n="150" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0115">mixed them together and realized it only half filled the amount that I wanted</u>
<u n="152" who="S0037">aw</u>
<u n="153" who="S0115">I realized I'd you know not put enough potatoes or whatever</u>
<u n="154" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0115">uh I'd also forgotten the peas <pause dur="short"/> and I'd also forgotten to put the broccoli in but then I thought that'd go separate</u>
<u n="156" who="S0037">on the side yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0115">Cos that's what we normally do for shepherd's pie then <pause dur="short"/> so I then had to do another batch of potatoes and then had to the same again with them and then had to put a load of frozen peas in them and then stick it on and then uh put some cheese on top and then put it in the oven and then</u>
<u n="158" who="S0037" trans="overlap">that's alright</u>
<u n="159" who="S0115">so it had uh has a pea layer and like a meat layer</u>
<u n="160" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no it was nice <pause dur="short"/> I like a pea</u>
<u n="161" who="S0115" trans="overlap">pea um leading to the cheesy peas experience at the top</u>
<u n="162" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I'm hoping <pause dur="short"/> squeezy cheesy peas <pause dur="short"/> I'm hoping that me um me peas germinate like I look at them every morning before I go work like ahh aww like</u>
<u n="163" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah cos I should get some of those mung beans uh <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>u</trunc> we've got <trunc>u</trunc> any old pretty much any bean can uh sprout I think as long as  as long as  they're intact</u>
<u n="164" who="S0037">well <pause dur="short"/> you'd be surprised</u>
<u n="165" who="S0115">well I I think it's the temperature partly yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0037">I know I wonder if I should bring them in</u>
<u n="167" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um and what I would maybe experiment with is just to get a little uh one of our little bowls and then you know a bit of water</u>
<u n="168" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and see if they <trunc>br</trunc> sprout?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0115" trans="overlap">you soak  you soak  them for a while then you empty and leave just a bit of water then you put the cling film on the top and you leave them there in in the warm and</u>
<u n="170" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="171" who="S0115">and once you've sprouted them I guess you're okay to</u>
<u n="172" who="S0037">plunk them in?</u>
<u n="173" who="S0115">you've got the roots and the <trunc>f</trunc> and the leaves coming out so you shouldn't</u>
<u n="174" who="S0037">they were really hardy last year they the peas they were just like I couldn't like they were grew so much</u>
<u n="175" who="S0115">yeah if you gimme gimme a few samples of I might be able to try</u>
<u n="176" who="S0037" trans="overlap">so <pause dur="short"/> there's loads <pause dur="short"/> they're in that box</u>
<u n="177" who="S0115">or I could just do <pause dur="short"/> so you can <trunc>s</trunc> maybe stick them in all together and <pause dur="short"/> stick all the seeds in together in a pile <pause dur="short"/> hope they sprout</u>
<u n="178" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no but then I'll not know what they are</u>
<u n="179" who="S0115">well I'll hopefully remember from the <trunc>s</trunc> the colour from the colour of the seed</u>
<u n="180" who="S0037" trans="overlap">some of them are tiny though</u>
<u n="181" who="S0115">alright yeah yeah well we'll we'll do them in do them separately then yeah get lots of like egg cups and like</u>

<u n="189" who="S0115">well yeah probably <pause dur="short"/> but there was a little bit of hotness going on</u>
<u n="190" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it was typical though isn't it? Like in the winter everyone's hoping it's gonna snow  hoping it's gonna snow  Then it snows everyone's whinging hoping it's gonna get warmer</u>
<u n="191" who="S0115" trans="overlap">oh right I don't I didn't want it to snow like uh <pause dur="short"/> not this time</u>

<u n="195" who="S0115">uh what I said before um I wasn't that not that pleased with that amount but uh <pause dur="short"/> it's it it was a bit it was for like a <trunc>th</trunc> the whole virtually the whole winter that we were here <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="196" who="S0037" trans="overlap">and we did have it cranked up like <pause dur="short"/> it's been really cold</u>
<u n="197" who="S0115">yeah I dunno what the <pause dur="short"/> I think we yeah I think we made some mistakes there with um</u>
<u n="198" who="S0037">but it's still not that bad compared to some people's</u>
<u n="199" who="S0115" trans="overlap">using um where we should've perhaps used the oven instead or if we used uh use it in in different methods</u>
<u n="200" who="S0037" trans="overlap">what how long was that for? I haven't heard this song for ages</u>
<u n="201" who="S0115">we should've perhaps come up with alternative methods to <pause dur="short"/> rather than relying on it cos like just it just was going and it wasn't really doing anything</u>
<u n="202" who="S0037">no <pause dur="short"/> so how long was it for?</u>
<u n="203" who="S0115">three months and a few days so it's <trunc>th</trunc> it's thirty-five pounds a month</u>
<u n="204" who="S0037">that's not too bad though</u>
<u n="205" who="S0115" trans="overlap">but that <pause dur="short"/> we <pause dur="short"/> ideally you'd want a bill for twenty pounds a week but you get uh</u>
<u n="206" who="S0037">yeah but <pause dur="short"/> excuse me</u>
<u n="207" who="S0115" trans="overlap">you get it gets balanced by the fact that the summer months are much less than twenty pounds they should hopefully be ten pounds a month so</u>
<u n="208" who="S0037">it was like <pause dur="short"/> it was last summer like <pause dur="short"/> well I mean even so far we only have it on for hot water now like we don't have any  don't have any</u>
<u n="209" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah I mean I deliberately like sort of <pause dur="short"/> I could see it was quite low you know it was eighteen there nineteen there and nineteen here <pause dur="short"/> but I never put it on high and I don't  I don't  intend to either I think I'll I'lll always use alternative means</u>
<u n="210" who="S0037">once you  once you  make the meal</u>
<u n="211" who="S0115" trans="overlap">unless it's ridiculous I'd I'd use alternative means basically</u>

<u n="222" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="223" who="S0115">um so I yeah I'll just use that rather than <pause dur="short"/> but it was just  it was just  going and going and really wasn't doing anything it was quite annoying</u>
<u n="224" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I know</u>
<u n="225" who="S0115">um and if we'd have cranked it up then it would've cost even more so</u>
