<u n="20" who="S0335">and <unclear>therefore we're</unclear> not going all the way <pause dur="short"/> cos I had all this all this erm <pause dur="short"/> all these shenanigans with the logistics of <pause dur="short"/> erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> didn't know if he could finish work early</u>

<u n="26" who="S0335">and erm <pause dur="short"/> we wondered if we could get an early train or not so I was on the train saving us a seat cos it was a commuter train to London and everything</u>
<u n="27" who="S0262">oh wow</u>
<u n="28" who="S0335" trans="overlap">I didn't know if they could make it and in the end about two minutes</u>

<u n="37" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="39" who="S0262">and then you got this thing when you got down there it's like oh</u>

<u n="41" who="S0262">no god no</u>
<u n="42" who="S0335" trans="overlap">I mean just just the logistics involved</u>
<u n="43" who="S0262">it's the effort yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0335">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and and the time <trunc>trav</trunc> time travel</u>
<u n="45" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="46" who="S0335">time travelling you know?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0335">mm yeah it was bit of an investment so</u>
<u n="49" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0335">so I'm glad that we did that cos that meant</u>
<u n="51" who="S0262" trans="overlap">so was the other guy good?</u>
<u n="52" who="S0335">he was alright I was saying to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> though earlier that erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> a a <pause dur="short"/> very good guitarist and</u>
<u n="53" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="54" who="S0335">actually his bass guitarist used to be in erm Suede apparently</u>
<u n="55" who="S0262">wow</u>
<u n="56" who="S0335">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and he <trunc>w</trunc> he was really really good musically</u>
<u n="57" who="S0262" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="58" who="S0335">erm <pause dur="short"/> the lyrics were a bit simplistic on on at least some of the songs he was sort of story telling</u>
<u n="59" who="S0262" trans="overlap"><unclear>okay</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="60" who="S0335">which is fine</u>
<u n="61" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0335">but it was very literal</u>
<u n="63" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="64" who="S0335">and to give you an example of that so one of them was erm <pause dur="short"/> a song where he'd gone back to his parents' home <pause dur="short"/> erm I think it was in <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> and it had obviously erm fallen into disrepair <pause dur="short"/> and made him think about you know memories and stuff like that whatever <pause dur="short"/> and erm but some of the lyrics were things like <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> there were no windows on any floor <pause dur="short"/> then there was another line <pause dur="short"/> and then it was <unclear>you know</unclear> <vocal desc="laugh"/> because you don't live there any <pause dur="short"/> more</u>
<u n="65" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="66" who="S0335"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and you just think <vocal desc="laugh"/> really</u>
<u n="67" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0335">isn't that a little bit teenage</u>
<u n="69" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="70" who="S0335">a little under developed? cos he <unclear>you know he's</unclear> mid thirties</u>
<u n="71" who="S0262" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="72" who="S0335">and it it it we were we were <trunc>we</trunc>went outside for a cigarette you know we were giggling about that one</u>
<u n="73" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0335">I mean am I being a bitch?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="76" who="S0335">you know if I'm if I'm being that critical <pause dur="short"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said no</u>
<u n="77" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="78" who="S0335">I'm the same <trunc>c</trunc> little bit <pause dur="short"/> cos he had said as part of spiel this guy he said this one hasn't made it onto the <pause dur="short"/> erm album <unclear>it's the</unclear></u>
<u n="79" who="S0262" trans="overlap">cos it's shit <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="80" who="S0335"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it stays in in the set you know</u>
<u n="81" who="S0262" trans="overlap">but it's part of my repertoire <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="82" who="S0335">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0262">it's the one of the ones I like to sing live <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0335">and and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said you know yeah exactly</u>
<u n="85" who="S0262">cos I don't have to try too hard to remember the lyrics <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0335">it's it's just there <pause dur="short"/> it's like yeah it's just there because it's really really <unclear/></u>
<u n="87" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="88" who="S0335">and not not all of them were that bad don't get me wrong</u>
<u n="89" who="S0262">no</u>
<u n="90" who="S0335" trans="overlap">like erm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0262">so it was hit and miss in terms of the tracks though?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0335">little bit and also I <pause dur="short"/> I don't know I think <trunc>s</trunc> you can sometimes get a bit spoilt if you <trunc>loo</trunc> if you're used to and you appreciate the complexities of</u>
<u n="93" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0335">someone like <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> for example</u>
<u n="95" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0335">and and er that sort of thing</u>
<u n="97" who="S0262">oh gosh yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0335" trans="overlap">and you've got <pause dur="short"/> suggestions in lyrics</u>
<u n="99" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0335">and <pause dur="short"/> absolutely heart wrenching vocals</u>
<u n="101" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0335">erm because just the power behind them as as as well as his voice being <pause dur="short"/> suitable for it <pause dur="short"/> then when someone else who's trying to sort of sing their heart out it it mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0335">it's like</u>
<u n="105" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0335">it's like I said to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I erm <pause dur="short"/> I said it this is it's a weird comparison to make but it but it popped into my head <pause dur="short"/> but erm you know there was some poetry that I wrote that I was going to read out at grandma's funeral</u>
<u n="107" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0335">and I actually realised that it wasn't appropriate for public consumption</u>
<u n="109" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0335" trans="overlap">it was <pause dur="short"/> it was part of my processing</u>
<u n="111" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0335">and that was it and that's where it stayed</u>
<u n="113" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0335">not in a sort of British oh I'm I'm shy to express it</u>
<u n="115" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0335">but actually because it was just <pause dur="short"/> more simplistic <pause dur="short"/> er childish in its</u>
<u n="117" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0335"><trunc>s</trunc>style and everything when you read it back when you weren't in the moment</u>
<u n="119" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0335">you know and it it just reminded me of that <unclear>I just think yeah</unclear></u>

<u n="518" who="S0335">tell the authorities they're not gonna do anything</u>
<u n="519" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="520" who="S0335">partly cos they're under resourced and partly cos they don't do</u>

<u n="532" who="S0335">that sort of stuff you know</u>
<u n="533" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="534" who="S0335">so <pause dur="short"/> it was frustrating so in the end <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/>  you know traffic and the way that they sort of produce reports and try and lobby governments and <pause dur="short"/> stuff like that <pause dur="short"/> seems a sensible solution and they they do have quite a lot of <pause dur="short"/> oomph I guess you'd say there's <trunc>t</trunc> some weight behind them <pause dur="short"/> so if there's er CITES meetings and things like that</u>
<u n="535" who="S0262">CITES?</u>
<u n="536" who="S0335" trans="overlap">CITES sorry so CITES erm is an acronym and it's C I T E S <pause dur="short"/> for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</u>

<u n="550" who="S0335">erm</u>
<u n="551" who="S0262">so who set that up CITES then? when did that get set up?</u>

<u n="553" who="S0262">oh</u>
<u n="554" who="S0335">I remember that cos it's the year I was born</u>

<u n="559" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="560" who="S0335">and and became one of these things where <pause dur="short"/> er governments had an option to sign up to it <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and it is all about agreeing <pause dur="short"/> the levels at which different species can be traded so that those trade levels are sustainable</u>
<u n="561" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="562" who="S0335">erm it's not about <pause dur="short"/> mm hardcore conservation</u>
<u n="563" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="564" who="S0335">of leave the world alone</u>
<u n="565" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="566" who="S0335">it's about accepting that people are gonna trade stuff</u>
<u n="567" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="568" who="S0335">and you might as well try and control it</u>
<u n="569" who="S0262">it is it having much of an effect?</u>

<u n="571" who="S0262">no yeah</u>

<u n="588" who="S0335">and of course Japan's got you know various erm <pause dur="short"/> trading agreements with various countries and they're just like come on you know you wanna keep you know your lead or whatever open or this you know university agreement open or whatever <pause dur="short"/> let's just forget the tuna shall we?</u>
<u n="589" who="S0262">mm</u>

<u n="591" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="592" who="S0335">so they abstain or they vote in favour so <unclear>that didn't matter</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> you know? but I mean that that doesn't happen all the time</u>
<u n="593" who="S0262">no</u>
<u n="594" who="S0335">erm <pause dur="short"/> but the worst that can happen is for example this year <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> there was a big hoo ha about erm <pause dur="short"/> vietnam</u>

<u n="616" who="S0335">and erm drink it <pause dur="short"/> in a powdered form it's good for hangovers <pause dur="short"/> and things like that and longevity and of course it's meant to be <pause dur="short"/> well according to some people erm it's meant to be good for <pause dur="short"/> erections etcetera although that's actually <pause dur="short"/> not what it was ever originally used for <pause dur="short"/> in the</u>

<u n="628" who="S0335" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no what what happened a few years ago</u>
<u n="629" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> god</u>
<u n="630" who="S0335">probably oh god is it four or five years ago now? you could easily track it back looking at the media <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> was that someone claimed that rhino horn had cured erm cancer in a government official <pause dur="short"/> and of course then demand shot through the roof <pause dur="short"/> and rhino started being slaughtered again in Africa</u>
<u n="631" who="S0262">oh god</u>

<u n="634" who="S0335">there might be <pause dur="short"/> there might <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember now <pause dur="short"/> but erm <pause dur="short"/> you know erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> trouble is when they when they get to that sort of level you start getting <unclear>some</unclear> inbreeding and stuff with slow breeding rates and very very sensitive nervy individuals</u>

<u n="636" who="S0335">but they just become what conservationists call non viable</u>

<u n="639" who="S0262" trans="overlap"><unclear>the</unclear></u>
<u n="640" who="S0335">yeah <pause dur="short"/> what we what that means technically non viable in in sort of biological terms I guess <pause dur="short"/> well that that they say</u>
<u n="641" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="642" who="S0335">is the the way they measure it is erm if a species <pause dur="short"/> erm if everything if everything as it is now remains constant <pause dur="short"/> erm the species will not erm survive in a hundred years in a healthy genetic state</u>
<u n="643" who="S0262">jeez</u>
<u n="644" who="S0335">so it doesn't mean they will be extinct within a hundred years</u>
<u n="645" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="646" who="S0335">it means that the population that are left are gonna have inbreeding problems and <pause dur="short"/> all sorts of stuff and it is the beginning of the end <pause dur="short"/> it's non viable is is the word that they use <pause dur="short"/> which is why you might see some discussions sometimes if you ever read articles in er New Scientist or something</u>
<u n="647" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="648" who="S0335">discussing it sometimes <pause dur="short"/> it's it's controversial but they say well actually stop <pause dur="short"/> stop it they're gone <pause dur="short"/> you know most sub species are already gone <pause dur="short"/> and we should be focusing on different species</u>
<u n="649" who="S0262">oh stop it as in stop stop the effort on on <trunc>w</trunc> for the er?</u>
<u n="650" who="S0335">yeah</u>
<u n="651" who="S0262">resources towards the?</u>

<u n="665" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="666" who="S0335" trans="overlap">get really wound up obviously <pause dur="short"/> erm but I can see it unfortunately it's it comes down like most things do it comes down to a cost benefit analysis and</u>

<u n="1240" who="S0335">who wants really clear <pause dur="short"/> recommendations <pause dur="short"/> the specific action points</u>

<u n="1269" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="1275" who="S0262">thank you</u>
<u n="1276" who="S0335">a a paper would start out by saying <pause dur="short"/> in the nineteen sixties erm car theft was going through the roof <pause dur="short"/> erm it was costing</u>

<u n="1278" who="S0335">an estimated blah blah blah million</u>
<u n="1279" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1280" who="S0335">you know insurance was erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>in</trunc>increasing</u>
<u n="1281" who="S0262">thank you</u>
<u n="1282" who="S0335">it was costing the police which is therefore costing the public</u>
<u n="1283" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1284" who="S0335">you know this much money or whatever <pause dur="short"/> erm but car manufacturers were doing little slash nothing about it</u>
<u n="1285" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1286" who="S0335">erm <pause dur="short"/> therefore <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> we're <trunc>tr</trunc> we were trying to find a way <pause dur="short"/> or therefore it was necessary to <pause dur="short"/> erm find a way to <pause dur="short"/> erm incentivise <pause dur="short"/> some more socially responsible behaviour</u>
<u n="1287" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="1288" who="S0335">by the manufacturers</u>
<u n="1289" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1290" who="S0335">one thing that they did that was done was that a car theft index</u>
<u n="1291" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1292" who="S0335">erm was published</u>
<u n="1293" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0335">so that people knew which were the most risky cars to be</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0335">erm to own</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1298" who="S0335">therefore insurance became an issue</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0335">erm or sorry the insurance industries got involved</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1302" who="S0335">therefore there was an incentive for the manufacturers to internalise which is an economic term</u>
<u n="1303" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0335">for taking on the costs</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0335">of adding things like immobilisers central locking</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1308" who="S0335">all that sort of stuff</u>
<u n="1309" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0335">erm this paper erm tells the story of the development of that index <pause dur="short"/> and erm <pause dur="short"/> gives evidence of erm its effectiveness</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0262">okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0335">and and that's your abstract</u>

<u n="1315" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0335">and and so it's not at all erm erm <pause dur="short"/> ambiguous</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0335">it's <pause dur="short"/> not <pause dur="short"/> convoluted language</u>
<u n="1319" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1320" who="S0335">it is <pause dur="short"/> the the the</u>
<u n="1321" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it is like what it is like yeah</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0335" trans="overlap">yeah this this was the problem <pause dur="short"/> this is what happened</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0335">and this is what this paper's gonna talk about</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0335">and you just think right okay I'm totally on board with that</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0335">I <trunc>w</trunc> I therefore decide whether or not to keep reading <pause dur="short"/> you know because</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0335">I don't have to sort of search <pause dur="short"/> to sort of work</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0335">out whether or not it's relevant or whether or not it's <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> someone pulling the wool over my eyes a bit</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0335">so I just needed a publication to keep my career going or whatever</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0335">so I I do find that within that erm <pause dur="short"/> specialism <pause dur="short"/> and I like it</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0335">erm <pause dur="short"/> and you do find it in the hard sciences I think to an</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1340" who="S0335">extent because you're often talking about <pause dur="short"/> sorry you're often reading about the results of experiments</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1342" who="S0335">you know?</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="1344" who="S0335">and that always starts with a literature review which says this is what's been done in the past</u>
<u n="1345" who="S0262">mm <pause dur="short"/> are they systematic ones? or systemic?</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0335">erm</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0262"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1348" who="S0335" trans="overlap"><trunc>sys</trunc>systematic</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0262">it is systematic isn't it yeah?</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0335" trans="overlap">it it it it should've been at at least <pause dur="short"/> erm you know reasonably systematic</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0335" trans="overlap">literature review erm</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0335">if it's in a a highly ranked journal</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0335">otherwise it wouldn't be accepted</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1358" who="S0335">so you say this is what's gone before</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0335">therefore the gap in knowledge is here</u>
<u n="1361" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1362" who="S0335">this paper therefore <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0262">addresses that</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0335">addresses part of that gap</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0335">by blah blah blah <pause dur="short"/> in the</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0335">experiment you know</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0335">and then it goes on to the experiment and the results</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0335">and again you you know it might be a slightly longwinded way of saying it <pause dur="short"/> but A you know where it's going</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0335">and B it very quickly captures you up on a whole <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> specialised area</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0262">right</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0335">if you read the literature review</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0335">erm so you know where they are</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0262">so that's very different from <pause dur="short"/> the I suppose the <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah the history of of <trunc>wri</trunc> of academic erm writing about education <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0262">you know as a social science and is it even <pause dur="short"/> a discipline in its own right you know? there are still massive questions about that which <pause dur="short"/> you know you find in the way that researchers write or academics write about education is that <pause dur="short"/> they themselves aren't too sure <pause dur="short"/> quite a lot of the time <pause dur="short"/> what <pause dur="short"/> actually is education is it a subject?</u>

<u n="1391" who="S0262">which I think is why my <trunc>f</trunc> you know I was telling you about my five thousand word essay which I did for my masters which is you know <pause dur="short"/> all about these paradigms</u>

<u n="1393" who="S0262">about four different paradigms that can exist you know for in education I think <unclear>more</unclear> for research purposes</u>

<u n="1400" who="S0335"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="1401" who="S0262">what constitutes <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> you know the the pillars let's say</u>

<u n="1403" who="S0262">of education and <trunc>t</trunc> and educational research</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0262"><trunc>i</trunc>it's very wishy washy <pause dur="short"/> so there have been people in the past who've heavily criticised this I mean I can</u>
<u n="1406" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1407" who="S0262">think of a few and they're very much involved in policy <pause dur="short"/> but they're miles older now I mean they're in their sixties</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0262">you know they were addressing it when <unclear>it probably</unclear> really came to light</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1411" who="S0262">erm and of course they have public debates as well about it you know with it being a public you know good in the sense of education but <pause dur="short"/> I find for me even to get started <trunc>n</trunc>now on this paper which is quite a curious one because as I say I'm not an <trunc>a</trunc> a researcher I'm not on the payroll <pause dur="short"/> as an academic <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> though the person I'm writing with is</u>
<u n="1412" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1413" who="S0262">but I'm not <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> you know my <pause dur="short"/> my question I keep questioning is the ethical framework behind it which I can find something to kind of rest on</u>
<u n="1414" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0262">but still the <trunc>s</trunc> the the the role that I'm playing <pause dur="short"/> could be seen as a participant in research</u>

<u n="1417" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah I'm not anonymous</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0262">I could be</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0262">but that means then I don't</u>

<u n="1423" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0262">and that's the thing I'm really trying to figure out at the moment is is it really about being a participant in the study? or is it actually about being a named author <pause dur="short"/> a person who <pause dur="short"/> has had this experience?</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0262">and it is part of a growing <pause dur="short"/> nascent area of research in education this third space <pause dur="short"/> but I can see that quite a lot of people might just look at it and go <pause dur="short"/> so what?</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0262">so you turned up for work each day and you had some frustrating <pause dur="short"/> experiences but <pause dur="short"/> well so don't we all? so <pause dur="short"/> you know the that's that's the question I'm trying to answer at the moment is <pause dur="short"/> how do you get the message across without coming across as being <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> I dunno I suppose highly critical</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0262">critical would be alright</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0262">but what am I actually criticising? you know I could be just <trunc>crit</trunc>criticising my line manager and nobody is gonna be particularly interested in that so</u>
<u n="1434" who="S0335">well <pause dur="short"/> okay so one way to reframe that maybe that might be helpful would be to not think of it in terms of criticisms <pause dur="short"/> you think of it in terms of observations</u>
<u n="1435" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1436" who="S0335">so can you come up with a list of recurring <pause dur="short"/> situations <pause dur="short"/> themes</u>

<u n="1438" who="S0335">questions <pause dur="short"/> sources of confusion <pause dur="short"/> whatever</u>

<u n="1441" who="S0262" trans="overlap">uhu <pause dur="short"/> uhu</u>
<u n="1442" who="S0335">you almost want to come up with a list</u>
<u n="1443" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1444" who="S0335">and say you know this kept happening <pause dur="short"/> for example</u>
<u n="1445" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1446" who="S0335">erm <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> doctor X was trying to teach class Y</u>
<u n="1447" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and give a and give a <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1448" who="S0335">and</u>
<u n="1449" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1450" who="S0335">blah blah blah <pause dur="short"/> and give an example where you can</u>

<u n="1452" who="S0335" whoConfidence="low">erm</u>
<u n="1453" who="S0262">yeah it's a good idea <pause dur="short"/> I like that yeah that's er observations</u>

<u n="1455" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1456" who="S0335">that's what you start with</u>
<u n="1457" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1458" who="S0335">and then you can discuss <pause dur="short"/> where the source of those <pause dur="short"/> of the issues which caused those observations <pause dur="short"/> or the situations which led to those observations <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1459" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1460" who="S0335">erm <pause dur="short"/> and I think it's okay to say you haven't got all the answers</u>
<u n="1461" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1462" who="S0335">to that bit</u>
<u n="1463" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1464" who="S0335">and that's actually why further research is necessary</u>
<u n="1465" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1466" who="S0335">and actually more participants are needed</u>
<u n="1467" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1468" who="S0335">and more action research is needed</u>
<u n="1469" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1470" who="S0335">and that would lead on naturally to the recommendation that</u>
<u n="1471" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1472" who="S0335">in essence <pause dur="short"/> more people like me are needed</u>
<u n="1473" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="1475" who="S0262">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1476" who="S0335" trans="overlap">you know?</u>
<u n="1477" who="S0262">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> that's it yeah</u>
<u n="1478" who="S0335">and <trunc>th</trunc> and then you the so then the overall purpose of the paper is <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> to argue the case with evidence</u>
<u n="1479" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1480" who="S0335">of why this role</u>
<u n="1481" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1482" who="S0335">and further research into it <pause dur="short"/> is is important</u>
<u n="1483" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1484" who="S0335">erm <pause dur="long"/> yeah so so that I mean that's that's one of things isn't it? you've gotta be clear what your what the purpose of the paper is from</u>
<u n="1485" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1486" who="S0335">the start</u>
<u n="1487" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1488" who="S0335">you always need to you always need to write your <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> conclusions and what you come out conclusions and recommendations <pause dur="short"/> before you write the rest of it</u>
<u n="1489" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1490" who="S0335" trans="overlap">at at least have them sketched in your head</u>
<u n="1491" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1492" who="S0335">and and then you tailor the paper so that you logically argue up</u>
<u n="1493" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1494" who="S0335">up to that conclusion</u>
<u n="1495" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I know what you mean <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1496" who="S0335">and you might have ten other <pause dur="short"/> points that you want to make</u>
<u n="1497" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1498" who="S0335">but you save them</u>
<u n="1499" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1500" who="S0335">and that's that's the skill</u>
<u n="1501" who="S0262"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1502" who="S0335">I think in good academic writing</u>
<u n="1503" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1504" who="S0335">a clear paper <pause dur="short"/> argues strongly <trunc>al</trunc>along one line</u>
<u n="1505" who="S0262">one <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1506" who="S0335">to to deal with it thoroughly</u>
<u n="1507" who="S0262" trans="overlap">main argument <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1508" who="S0335">and okay you <pause dur="short"/> acknowledge that other areas exist and they will be addressed</u>
<u n="1509" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1510" who="S0335">you know in in other articles and whatever</u>
<u n="1511" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1512" who="S0335">so people can't say oh you didn't think of this</u>
<u n="1513" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1514" who="S0335">say well actually I did and if you read it I did actually <unclear>copy the book</unclear> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1515" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1516" who="S0335">you know?</u>
<u n="1517" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1518" who="S0335">and and obviously there's an element of that</u>
<u n="1519" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1520" who="S0335" trans="overlap">erm <pause dur="short"/> but being</u>
<u n="1521" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1522" who="S0335">really clear on your purpose</u>
<u n="1523" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1524" who="S0335">what</u>
<u n="1525" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1526" who="S0335">you want out of it</u>
<u n="1527" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1528" who="S0335">you know so first of all its intended audience and</u>
<u n="1529" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1530" who="S0335">purpose of your paper</u>
<u n="1531" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1532" who="S0335">is it policy makers? d'you wanna</u>
<u n="1533" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1534" who="S0335">d'you wanna <pause dur="short"/> erm people to create more jobs?</u>
<u n="1535" who="S0262">uhu</u>
<u n="1536" who="S0335">people like you essentially?</u>
<u n="1537" who="S0262" trans="overlap">uhu <pause dur="short"/> well this is where I'm thinking about erm how does one decide on which erm paper to submit to? cos I was thinking <pause dur="short"/> if you have a clear idea two or three you know say journals that</u>
<u n="1538" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1539" who="S0262">you think this type of research would fit into quite nicely</u>
<u n="1540" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1541" who="S0262">you can work backwards then in</u>
<u n="1542" who="S0335">yeah</u>
<u n="1543" who="S0262">terms of look at what <trunc>h</trunc> the intended audience for that journal</u>
<u n="1544" who="S0335">yeah</u>
<u n="1545" who="S0262">you can look at the styles</u>
<u n="1546" who="S0335" trans="overlap"><unclear>look at the style</unclear> etcetera etcetera</u>
<u n="1547" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you can look at what's</u>
<u n="1548" who="S0335">yeah</u>
<u n="1549" who="S0262">just gone before the year before so don't cover that because they're probably not gonna <pause dur="short"/> be</u>
<u n="1550" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1551" who="S0262">interesting to the editors or whoever</u>
<u n="1552" who="S0335">well no there would be if it was a logical progression from that</u>
<u n="1553" who="S0262">true <pause dur="short"/> true</u>
<u n="1554" who="S0335">yeah</u>
<u n="1555" who="S0262">so I was thinking well you know do you target erm? definitely have a look at those ones? or d'you go you know into an area that say that might actually be <pause dur="short"/> er quite useful for some erm you know journals where they perhaps they're not even aware yet</u>
<u n="1556" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1557" who="S0262">of this type of research that's coming through?</u>
<u n="1558" who="S0335" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1559" who="S0262">or maybe have a two-pronged effect <pause dur="short"/> you go for the ones where already began become established <pause dur="short"/> and you try a</u>
<u n="1560" who="S0335" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and do do your in depth</u>
<u n="1561" who="S0262">a a wildcard kind of</u>

<u n="1564" who="S0335">and your simple policy oriented to the point one</u>
<u n="1565" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1566" who="S0335">as almost a letter</u>
<u n="1567" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1568" who="S0335">to a a <trunc>d</trunc> a erm a practitioner's journal</u>

<u n="1570" who="S0335">or something</u>
<u n="1571" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1572" who="S0335">or a <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what is there is there sort of a a circular of the higher education authority?</u>
<u n="1573" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1574" who="S0335">or something?</u>
<u n="1575" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1576" who="S0335">you know research notes</u>

<u n="1581" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1582" who="S0335">you know is is there that sort of practitioner policy maker erm <pause dur="short"/> route?</u>
<u n="1583" who="S0262" trans="overlap">there is there's the higher education academy <pause dur="short"/> and they</u>
<u n="1584" who="S0335">right</u>
<u n="1585" who="S0262">commission small you know small erm pieces of research I mean that's commission <unclear>their calls for</unclear> you know erm?</u>
<u n="1586" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1587" who="S0262">but yeah inside there <pause dur="short"/> yeah you're right research notes <pause dur="short"/> that would assist</u>

<u n="1589" who="S0262">erm</u>
<u n="1590" who="S0335">the poor</u>

<u n="1593" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1594" who="S0335">research</u>
<u n="1595" who="S0262">exactly</u>
<u n="1596" who="S0335">to then come up with relevant</u>

<u n="1598" who="S0335">and up to date policy</u>
<u n="1599" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1600" who="S0335">yeah</u>
<u n="1601" who="S0262">cos I found one paper that's just <pause dur="short"/> it's the first paper that er I'm aware of at the moment anyway <pause dur="short"/> I can't find any others but I mean you know <pause dur="short"/> there could be something but erm <pause dur="short"/> anyway let's just say I found one paper <trunc>f</trunc> that's just been commissioned and <pause dur="short"/> published <pause dur="short"/> last year <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> no actually it was earlier this year <pause dur="short"/> into this idea of academic and professional partnerships</u>
<u n="1602" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1603" who="S0262">and how that feeds into</u>
<u n="1604" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1605" who="S0262">overarching organisational strategies of the universities and blah blah blah</u>
<u n="1606" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1607" who="S0262">so <pause dur="short"/> there are two academics you know lead erm investigators on that on that erm publication <pause dur="short"/> which is directed towards I would say <pause dur="short"/> policy makers</u>
<u n="1608" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1609" who="S0262">and practitioners <pause dur="short"/> less so a academic audience</u>
<u n="1610" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1611" who="S0262">erm <pause dur="short"/> but whether getting in touch with those two professors</u>
<u n="1612" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1613" who="S0262">and saying <pause dur="short"/> I am actually currently writing a paper</u>
<u n="1614" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1615" who="S0262">that feeds directly into what you're saying that you didn't get from your research</u>
<u n="1616" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1617" who="S0262">cos they only had an eight percent respondent</u>
<u n="1618" who="S0335">right</u>
<u n="1619" who="S0262">a response rate on their surveys</u>
<u n="1620" who="S0335" trans="overlap"><unclear>answer it</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> right</u>

<u n="1624" who="S0335">uhu</u>
<u n="1625" who="S0262">so I was thinking <pause dur="short"/> why not give it a go and just see if I contact these two</u>

<u n="1627" who="S0262">and say what kind of <trunc>i</trunc>ideas advice or <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> sort of directions do you think this would most be useful to as a contribution <pause dur="short"/> you know?</u>
<u n="1628" who="S0335">mm</u>
<u n="1629" who="S0262">and maybe they have some ideas about how to be a bit more <pause dur="short"/> pointed <pause dur="short"/> about</u>

<u n="1631" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="1632" who="S0335">it it <trunc>d</trunc> it's so difficult isn't it because they get people <pause dur="short"/> who either jump on a bandwagon and say oh well I if if I co author with you</u>
<u n="1633" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="1634" who="S0335">then we're going to this journal</u>

<u n="1636" who="S0335">when actually they've done bugger all work</u>
