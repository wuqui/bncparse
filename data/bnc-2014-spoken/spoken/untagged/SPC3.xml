<u n="66" who="S0198">but prepaid is sixteen pounds fifty</u>
<u n="67" who="S0230">oh</u>
<u n="68" who="S0198">but underneath it says in brackets on bookings before the thirteenth of August but I guess what they've done is issued prepaid tickets to the to all the <unclear>places</unclear> and they've just still got them</u>
