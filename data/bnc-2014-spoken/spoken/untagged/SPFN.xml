<u n="376" who="S0326">know what's going on and Emily Dickinson's obviously totally batshit crazy</u>
<u n="377" who="S0329">yeah batshit crazy</u>
<u n="378" who="S0326" trans="overlap">she <unclear>also</unclear> writes these funny like these <trunc>l</trunc> sort of really lucid <pause dur="short"/> poems that are weird but they like sort of touched a nerve so I just thought that was <pause dur="short"/> a poem about her <trunc>on</trunc> her creative process in a way <pause dur="short"/> I felt a cleaving in my mind <pause dur="short"/> she's working it out at the same time as she's falling apart</u>
<u n="379" who="S0329">go on read the rest of it to me</u>
<u n="380" who="S0326">I felt a cleaving in my mind <pause dur="short"/> as if my brain had split <pause dur="short"/> I tried to match it seam by seam but could not make it fit <pause dur="short"/> a thought behind I strove to join <unclear>unto</unclear> the thought before <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>the</unclear> sequence ravelled out of sound like balls upon a floor <pause dur="short"/> there's the other word ravel <pause dur="short"/> so if you <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>unra</trunc> if you ravel out a jumper</u>
<u n="381" who="S0329">is that? you don't ravel it</u>
<u n="382" who="S0326">no but it but it's in modern <pause dur="short"/> the the word in modern days means different from what it does in eighteen sixty <pause dur="short"/> in eighteen sixty unravel's not really a word <pause dur="short"/> you <unclear>sort of</unclear> ravel up something and you ravel up something <pause dur="short"/> it means both again <pause dur="short"/> it's like it's like does the same thing as cleaving does <pause dur="short"/> the sequence ravelled out of sound <pause dur="short"/> so what is it coming together or falling apart? I don't know <pause dur="short"/> and then also there's a sort of regular iambic rhythm <pause dur="short"/> it's very composed for <pause dur="short"/> rhythmically for a poem that's about losing your mind</u>
<u n="383" who="S0329">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's for sure</u>
<u n="384" who="S0326">well anyway that's why I bought that book</u>
<u n="385" who="S0329">oh I see okay well I think that's <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>that's</unclear> that's brilliant <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and it's really interesting and I'm sorry if I gave you the impression that I wasn't interested <pause dur="short"/> cos I was <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>u</trunc> you've got shoes on so can you take that out? and also the one that's on the doorstep? tie it up <pause dur="short"/> thank you very much <pause dur="long"/> <unclear><trunc>m</trunc> put it on there</unclear></u>
<u n="386" who="S0326">so I also talked about how <pause dur="short"/> how it was a <trunc>diff</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> a really different experience to read it on a page or to listen to it <pause dur="short"/> because it looks <pause dur="short"/> like <trunc>u</trunc> when I said about the rhythm <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> it sounds all like regular but if you look at it it's got all these dashes</u>
<u n="387" who="S0329">oh yeah the</u>
<u n="388" who="S0326">capitalization</u>
<u n="389" who="S0329">but it all <unclear>not</unclear> every single in capitals</u>
<u n="390" who="S0326" trans="overlap">yeah I know but even I I know</u>
<u n="391" who="S0329">yeah so it means that you it looks as though as though it's all breaking down</u>
<u n="392" who="S0326" trans="overlap"><unclear>like</unclear> if you <pause dur="short"/> yeah but if you didn't look at it and just heard someone say it <pause dur="short"/> it sounds like it's coming together</u>
<u n="393" who="S0329">yeah but you know that there are <pause dur="short"/> it's <pause dur="short"/> it's a mistake to think that she was just a naïve crazy batshit <trunc>w</trunc>woman</u>
