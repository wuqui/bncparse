<u n="240" who="S0579">definitely at the fish counter</u>
<u n="241" who="S0454">but actually if you're grilling them whole it's quite useful to have the heads on</u>
<u n="242" who="S0579">is it? oh</u>
<u n="243" who="S0454">yes cos then when you lift the tail bone out the whole thing comes off</u>

<u n="256" who="S0579">no Morrison's quite good for their fish</u>
<u n="257" who="S0454">mm but I find leaving the heads on is quite useful if if you're grilling them whole</u>
<u n="258" who="S0579" trans="overlap">better</u>
<u n="259" who="S0454">cos they don't fall apart on you</u>

<u n="322" who="S0579">no I don't I don't like that</u>
<u n="323" who="S0454" trans="overlap">which I've never understood cos actually it's easy to farm and that's why it's cheap in Spain so in Spain they'll have these rafts just wooden rafts and from the raft they would hang ropes down like proper</u>
<u n="324" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="325" who="S0454">you know the old-fashioned ropes you would see and on those ropes you know they might have <trunc>f</trunc> twenty ropes on a raft say</u>
<u n="326" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0454">six foot by six foot maybe ten foot by ten foot they would put I don't know what they're called like the eggs of the muscles and they'd they'd impregnate it and then you leave it there and after six weeks it would be full of muscles</u>
<u n="328" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="329" who="S0454">you scrape them off and you start again so it's incredibly cheap for them to farm you don't need to feed them they're just in the sea I've never understood why we didn't do that in the UK</u>
<u n="330" who="S0579">I don't know talking of fish in Spain I remember the smell used to be marvellous going in Spain</u>

<u n="332" who="S0579" trans="overlap">the fish you could smell it being cooked cooked outside they were cooking it like yeah</u>
<u n="333" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm yeah beautiful the nice thing about Spanish cooking is unlike the French the French dress things up a lot</u>
<u n="334" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0454">the Spanish don't bother they just start with very very good fresh local ingredients whatever's in season you can't buy things out of season and they just grill it and that's it salt</u>
<u n="336" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="337" who="S0454">just with salt and a bit of maybe a bit of salad and that's it nothing else and it's just delicious</u>

<u n="344" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="345" who="S0454">just if you've got good ingredients you shouldn't need to do much more than grill it and boil it bit of salad and that's pretty much it perfect meal</u>
<u n="346" who="S0579"><vocal desc="cough"/> yes I like French cooking though basically quite nice</u>
<u n="347" who="S0454">mm can be heavy though cos erm you know cream sauces can be quite heavy if you're not used to it <pause dur="short"/> suppose it depends on the sauce they do nice soups in France</u>

<u n="1294" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0454">I'm really sorry I didn't but he was my brother so I suppose you don't think of calling the police</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0579" trans="overlap">I know but someone puts <unclear/> your throat you you you have to report it cos of er if he doesn't kill you this time he might do it to somebody else</u>

<u n="1331" who="S0454">yes</u>

<u n="1352" who="S0579">what did he say to that then?</u>

<u n="1368" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0454">I mean I to be to be honest I think someone who does that must be a bit mentally ill</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0579"><unclear>yes</unclear></u>
<u n="1371" who="S0454" trans="overlap">because I don't think normal people go round and do that with or without alcohol</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0579" trans="overlap">well he no no no cos I mean he was normally that would frighten people in any case wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0454">yeah so I don't</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0579" trans="overlap">usually means there's something wrong with them someone holds a knife to your throat</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0454">I think there might be something wrong with them</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0454">I mean cos he had that do you remember when he was young he deliberately shot himself in the foot</u>

<u n="1384" who="S0579">no</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0454">but I mean it'd be quite difficult to do it by accident</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0579">well he had to pull the trigger to kick off this yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1387" who="S0454" trans="overlap">well exactly so I think he probably did do it deliberately and then you just think well who would do that? and there probably is something a bit wrong and he was quite young wasn't he?</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0579">well I remember</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0454">probably about ten</u>

<u n="1410" who="S0579">doesn't take much to touch the trigger <unclear/></u>
<u n="1411" who="S0454" trans="overlap">well no it's quite easy to do isn't it with a trigger? it's not yes</u>
<u n="1412" who="S0579">yeah I was I know some of my early training when I was in the Royal Air Force the thing we had to do was to use er various things like rifles and submachine guns just to defend your aircraft if they were attacked</u>

<u n="2440" who="S0579">you like your mushrooms?</u>
<u n="2441" who="S0454">yeah I do yeah what I've never understood in this country though is we only ever have one sort of mushroom when you travel to other countries it's like apples there's like six or seven different varieties in the supermarket</u>
<u n="2442" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh yeah <unclear>they used to</unclear> have different varieties of er er</u>
<u n="2443" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I've never understood that here we only have the closed ones the closed button ones and then the open ones</u>
<u n="2444" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2445" who="S0454">but that's actually the same <trunc>specie</trunc> they're just a bit older</u>
<u n="2446" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2447" who="S0454">we don't have different sorts</u>
<u n="2448" who="S0579">no she sends me the button ones or the other <trunc>one</trunc></u>
<u n="2449" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="2450" who="S0579">cos some of those other ones get to enormous sizes <unclear/></u>
<u n="2451" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes that's right</u>
<u n="2452" who="S0579">then they're not wanted apparently</u>
<u n="2453" who="S0454">no they've gone a bit woody yeah</u>
<u n="2454" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah that's what they say</u>
<u n="2455" who="S0454">yes so the the closed ones are more popular</u>
<u n="2456" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2457" who="S0454">but what I don't understand was why we only have one species in this country cos if you go to Japan you go down to the supermarket there'll be like five or six in every supermarket and completely different sorts there'll be these little spindly ones there'll be ones that look like brains which you can slice and fry like bacon delicious</u>
<u n="2458" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2459" who="S0454">I mean you you can find them probably in specialist stores here</u>
<u n="2460" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2461" who="S0454">but generally speaking we only have one sort maybe nowadays you might find oyster mushrooms at a push</u>
<u n="2462" who="S0579" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2463" who="S0454">that's quite unusual</u>
<u n="2464" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>but we</unclear> yeah we used to have er we used to sell oyster mushrooms <unclear/></u>
<u n="2465" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh right yes those are you see those more and more now</u>
<u n="2466" who="S0579">yeah I remember we used to grow those</u>
<u n="2467" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="2468" who="S0579">that must've been thirty years ago now yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="2469" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah oh yeah it's funny though cos the UK actually if you go into the woods you know there's millions of mushrooms aren't there?</u>
<u n="2470" who="S0579" trans="overlap">they grow</u>
<u n="2471" who="S0454">it's not a country where mushrooms are</u>
<u n="2472" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah no yeah</u>
<u n="2473" who="S0454">you know an unknown quantity</u>
<u n="2474" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2475" who="S0454">but maybe the British have always been a bit suspicious of mushrooms and other countries have just had them in their diet much more</u>
<u n="2476" who="S0579">well yes I suppose yes it used to be what did we use to have now? there used to be some one or two varieties was very specialised I know used to <unclear>be</unclear></u>
<u n="2477" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh right yes</u>
<u n="2478" who="S0579">forgotten which ones they used to call them now we had the great big mushrooms <unclear>come home</unclear> big flat ones and people wanted the small ones <unclear>sort of thing</unclear> yeah</u>

<u n="2480" who="S0579">oh the small ones yeah</u>
<u n="2481" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes yes they're sort of nice <trunc>t</trunc>texture</u>

<u n="2507" who="S0454">undermining the business and you know they have to close it and they never ever get to prosecute cos it's difficult to prove isn't it?</u>

<u n="2519" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="2520" who="S0579">but they wanted er less people on on the farm so they had to get rid of quite a lot of people</u>
<u n="2521" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah oh it's dreadful I bet it was the manager cos they're the people with access aren't they?</u>
<u n="2522" who="S0579" trans="overlap">well yes it was the manager</u>

<u n="2532" who="S0579">oh yes <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="2533" who="S0454">and we used to take a thousand pounds each on the tills just on the bar</u>
<u n="2534" who="S0579">oh yeah</u>
<u n="2535" who="S0454">in a night and there about ten bar staff so that's ten thousand pounds a night</u>
<u n="2536" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh golly yes</u>
<u n="2537" who="S0454">that's not to mention the restaurant restaurant food didn't go through our tills it went through somewhere else and they're charging well you know fifteen pounds a plate and it was full and it never made any money</u>
<u n="2538" who="S0579">oh there's something going wrong</u>
<u n="2539" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that's not possible is it?</u>
<u n="2540" who="S0579">not possible no</u>
<u n="2541" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so they sacked lots and lots of people cos they the manager claimed it was the staff stealing money and you know in the end head office found it was him</u>
<u n="2542" who="S0579" trans="overlap">was him? oh</u>
<u n="2543" who="S0454">but they couldn't prove it but by then they'd probably sacked twenty people</u>
<u n="2544" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2545" who="S0454">for you know various infringement I'm not saying they didn't steal anything but I mean they were stealing a glass of wine</u>
<u n="2546" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="2547" who="S0454">they weren't putting their hand in the till</u>

<u n="2549" who="S0454">I mean it's still wrong but a glass of wine is not ten thousand pounds</u>
<u n="2550" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>no yeah</unclear></u>
<u n="2551" who="S0454">a night and we're talking ten thousand pounds a night and yeah they said to him either you go and we won't push press for charges or you stay and we'll prosecute but they knew it'd be very difficult to prove it because he knew where all the secret cameras were</u>
<u n="2552" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="2553" who="S0454">so they probably didn't have any video evidence of it</u>
<u n="2554" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="2555" who="S0454">but I remember once going upstairs with him at the end of the shift and if the till was down he used to take it out our wages and he went oh that's for me and put twenty pounds in his pocket and I thought well that's a dishonest man isn't it?</u>
<u n="2556" who="S0579"><unclear>that's it</unclear></u>
<u n="2557" who="S0454" trans="overlap">because when the tills are down he's taking it out our wages even though he doesn't know who it is but when the tills are up</u>
<u n="2558" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2559" who="S0454">he's saying well that's for me</u>

<u n="2566" who="S0579">the secretaries</u>
<u n="2567" who="S0454">it's often the bookkeepers</u>

<u n="2671" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes it's probably</u>
<u n="2672" who="S0579">but they just let him soldier on anyway it was out of our hands at that time liquidators come in and and that was it</u>
<u n="2673" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm yes oh that's a shame</u>

<u n="2682" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah they yeah that's right that's yeah they usually cover their own steps banks do yeah</u>
<u n="2683" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes that's right well they've also turned a blind eye in this country to a lot of money laundering</u>
<u n="2684" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/> must've done yeah <unclear>that's it</unclear></u>
<u n="2685" who="S0454" trans="overlap">cos it was money coming through the bank wasn't it? they don't care where it's care from</u>
<u n="2686" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/> no no that's right <unclear/></u>
<u n="2687" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I think they care now cos they've done all sorts of damage to themself like HSBC's in done</u>
<u n="2688" who="S0579">oh HSBC yeah yeah to them yeah</u>
<u n="2689" who="S0454" trans="overlap">irreparable damage to their reputation now but they're <trunc>n</trunc> hardly going to go bust are they? so the</u>
<u n="2690" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh yeah well I suppose now it's all forgotten about isn't it? whereas yeah definitely</u>
<u n="2691" who="S0454" trans="overlap">well it will be won't it? yeah I mean they'll have to pay a fine but the fine they will pay will be nothing like the profits they've made over the past thirty years</u>
<u n="2692" who="S0579" trans="overlap">that's it <pause dur="short"/> mm not really no no no no no no <unclear/> that yeah</u>
<u n="2693" who="S0454" trans="overlap">from illegal money laundering</u>
<u n="2694" who="S0579">yeah no there's a lot of that going on</u>
<u n="2695" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="2696" who="S0579">it's it's stopped now though hasn't it?</u>
<u n="2697" who="S0454">well it's stopped in this country but they've just caught up in Switzerland haven't they with HSBC?</u>
<u n="2698" who="S0579" trans="overlap">have they?</u>
<u n="2699" who="S0454">that was only about six months ago</u>
<u n="2700" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="2701" who="S0454">it turned out <trunc>H</trunc> the Treasury here knew about it for years and didn't prosecute</u>
<u n="2702" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="2703" who="S0454">and then it got picked up by other EU governments and they are pressing charges</u>
<u n="2704" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="2705" who="S0454">and the Americans have been very good haven't they about insider trading and things?</u>
<u n="2706" who="S0579">oh some of them</u>
<u n="2707" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that they prosecuted some big banks</u>
<u n="2708" who="S0579" trans="overlap">I think I remember seeing the press recently yeah that's right</u>
<u n="2709" who="S0454">but I suppose the trouble is you need a big country like the USA to take on something like HSBC</u>
<u n="2710" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="2711" who="S0454">cos they've</u>
<u n="2712" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2713" who="S0454">got their team of lawyers</u>
<u n="2714" who="S0579">yeah yes yes</u>
<u n="2715" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and you've got your team of lawyers and it's just that's gonna drag on for years and cost billions in taxpayers' money and you never really get that money back I suppose do you?</u>
<u n="2716" who="S0579" trans="overlap">they only <trunc>won</trunc>winners are the lawyers <vocal desc="laugh"/> in those things</u>
<u n="2717" who="S0454">well it's true isn't it?</u>
<u n="2718" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="2719" who="S0454"><trunc>h</trunc> even if the government wins</u>
<u n="2720" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2721" who="S0454">the fine will be nothing like what they've spent on legal fees</u>
<u n="2722" who="S0579">no no</u>
<u n="2723" who="S0454">so it's more to set the precedent and I suppose most governments</u>
<u n="2724" who="S0579" trans="overlap">cos we did that on this company I was talking about there was a question should we prosecute? it was</u>
<u n="2725" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and I suppose they're thinking legal fees</u>
<u n="2726" who="S0579">oh and they decided mm well the creditors er the erm creditor I think decided not to prosecute</u>
<u n="2727" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="2728" who="S0579" trans="overlap">which <trunc>m</trunc> probably meant they got no money at all</u>
<u n="2729" who="S0454">well it's true</u>
<u n="2730" who="S0579">with all the people who'd be paying them</u>
<u n="2731" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it's unfortunate</u>
<u n="2732" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2733" who="S0454">but I mean it's the system's wrong that that happens but you might lose money</u>
<u n="2734" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2735" who="S0454">by winning</u>
<u n="2736" who="S0579">yeah probably yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2737" who="S0454">yes you lose money either way whether you win or whether you lost</u>
<u n="2738" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah perhaps you'll be</u>
<u n="2739" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you've spent it all on</u>
<u n="2740" who="S0579">perhaps you'll be a good lawyer</u>
<u n="2741" who="S0454" trans="overlap">legal fees no employment law's quite good though in Spain cos if you had a grudge against your employer you paid your own legal fees but even if you lost you never paid their legal fees</u>
<u n="2742" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="2743" who="S0454">and you never paid a court fee</u>
<u n="2744" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="2745" who="S0454">and I thought well that's quite good because the problem is</u>
<u n="2746" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh that's sensible</u>
<u n="2747" who="S0454">otherwise the employee will never take on a company</u>
<u n="2748" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yes no impossible</u>
<u n="2749" who="S0454">because the it would be prohibitive</u>
<u n="2750" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2751" who="S0454">the court costs if you lost</u>
<u n="2752" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2753" who="S0454">so that's quite good</u>
<u n="2754" who="S0579" trans="overlap">they can keep the court going for hour you know months after months after <trunc>mon</trunc> you'll keep paying you know</u>
<u n="2755" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah that's right so that's no good</u>
<u n="2756" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no no good that</u>
<u n="2757" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="2758" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2759" who="S0454">this country's got it a bit wrong I think with court fees and</u>
<u n="2760" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2761" who="S0454">legal fees that actually if you're just you know the creditor like that</u>
<u n="2762" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2763" who="S0454">there's no point trying to prosecute cos people get away with it</u>
<u n="2764" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no no I know we we've done several liquidations and they're always very not very nice things to do <unclear/></u>
<u n="2765" who="S0454" trans="overlap">no I can imagine they're unpleasant especially as most people will be completely innocent</u>
<u n="2766" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>then I did I</unclear> yeah</u>
<u n="2767" who="S0454">and have worked hard and someone unfortunately has got away with it usually the manager</u>
<u n="2768" who="S0579">I know I was asked by two banks outside of erm <anon type="place"/> they wanted an er independent liquidator</u>
<u n="2769" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="2770" who="S0579">for some reason they got me</u>
<u n="2771" who="S0454">oh yes had a good name</u>
<u n="2772" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> so they they I they must've asked a local bank I suppose and they to recommend and</u>

<u n="2774" who="S0579"><unclear>various erm</unclear> and er oh it was Lloyds and the Midland I suppose <unclear/> HSBC now of course</u>

<u n="2841" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="2842" who="S0579">and the <unclear>second they get up</unclear> I was I was taking the papers home one night looking at it and it suddenly dawned on me how it was making it look as if the profits were high up</u>
<u n="2843" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="2844" who="S0579">and so I I thought well and when I looked I mean back paper after paper after paper I suddenly realised he he'd been shoving up the valuation of the stocks on <unclear/></u>

<u n="2851" who="S0454">and so difficult to to track</u>
<u n="2852" who="S0579"><unclear/> now yeah</u>
<u n="2853" who="S0454">they they all seem like crooks to be honest</u>
<u n="2854" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh they no they are many of them</u>

<u n="2856" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>well</unclear> they were breaking the law on this one yeah yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="2857" who="S0454" trans="overlap">on this one they were and insider trading and things like that that's breaking the law</u>
<u n="2858" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no this no this was breaking the law</u>
<u n="2859" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="2860" who="S0579">they were just cheating the law</u>
<u n="2861" who="S0454" trans="overlap">they're so difficult to catch and most people you know even someone looking at the books it won't jump out at you straight away</u>
<u n="2862" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no no they kept it what what kept it going here they kept inflating the stocks</u>
<u n="2863" who="S0454">oh</u>
<u n="2864" who="S0579">year by year</u>
<u n="2865" who="S0454">that's interesting</u>
<u n="2866" who="S0579">so that that was making and I was only up there <trunc>s</trunc> like couple of times a year or something like that and had papers sent down <unclear/></u>
<u n="2867" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="2868" who="S0579">well I suddenly realised the stocks were vastly I thought well these have gone up so much over the past twelve months I thought well how on earth did it get that high?</u>
<u n="2869" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="2870" who="S0579">cos I I in my mind I could see all these it was poultry stuff and eggs and all that nonsense for Sainsbury's</u>

<u n="2872" who="S0579">and I suddenly realised there must've been something wrong and then then I <trunc>s</trunc> brought it to an end of course and the company went into liquidation yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2873" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh that's sad isn't it? yeah</u>
<u n="2874" who="S0579">I think actually they having said that at the end most of them saved their jobs</u>
<u n="2875" who="S0454">oh that's good</u>
<u n="2876" who="S0579">we were able to sell it off to somebody</u>

<u n="2881" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you know they've got nothing to do no responsibility for those kind of decisions</u>

<u n="2885" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="2886" who="S0579">it <trunc>i</trunc> the secretary in the case and the other chap was the manager <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="2888" who="S0579">the two together made a good combination</u>
<u n="2889" who="S0454">that's right yes it'll be difficult to get away with it on your own</u>
<u n="2890" who="S0579">on your own be difficult yeah that's right</u>

<u n="2892" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2893" who="S0454">but yes that's pretty hard</u>
<u n="2894" who="S0579" trans="overlap">I think I think I <unclear>noticed</unclear> somewhere now they they put a couple of fictitious names in there or something something like that I think yeah</u>

<u n="2911" who="S0454">and he used to work at The Guardian he said what's interesting about the UK is we'll punish <trunc>whe</trunc>when those people are prosecuted the law comes down incredibly hard on economic crime</u>
<u n="2912" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2913" who="S0454">and surprisingly light on things like murder</u>
<u n="2914" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2915" who="S0454">or rape particularly</u>
<u n="2916" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yes</u>

<u n="2918" who="S0579" trans="overlap">even those yeah</u>
<u n="2919" who="S0454">murder more so when you've got a dead body</u>
<u n="2920" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2921" who="S0454">at least you can prove it more easily but the law doesn't really see that you might get six years for murder that's pretty much the</u>
<u n="2922" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2923" who="S0454">norm nowadays you know six years it's not much is it for taking someone's life?</u>
<u n="2924" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no no for life no</u>
<u n="2925" who="S0454">permanently with intent</u>

<u n="2929" who="S0454">deliberately kill someone</u>
<u n="2930" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2931" who="S0454">is pretty premeditated and irreversible</u>
<u n="2932" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2933" who="S0454">and they get six years but economic crime they'll often get ten twelve years enormous fines</u>
<u n="2934" who="S0579" trans="overlap">enormous yeah twelve years yeah</u>
<u n="2935" who="S0454">and the government has always been really strict which says something about how we value what we value in the UK</u>
<u n="2936" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2937" who="S0454">which is a bit worrying actually</u>
<u n="2938" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2939" who="S0454">they've got a bit better lately I've noticed with murder but er the sentences seem to be longer</u>
<u n="2940" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>yeah</unclear> yeah sentences should be longer yeah</u>
<u n="2941" who="S0454">yes cos I mean six years for taking someone's life</u>
<u n="2942" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="2943" who="S0454">seems a bit of a joke whereas if you look at America</u>

<u n="2949" who="S0454"><trunc>n</trunc> mm most states have stopped but I think it's temporary because they had a problem with the EU the EU refused to sell the drugs that are used for lethal injection</u>
<u n="2950" who="S0579">oh I see</u>
<u n="2951" who="S0454" trans="overlap">cos I think they all did lethal injection</u>
<u n="2952" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2953" who="S0454">so they refused to do it and then they sourced their drugs from elsewhere and there were a couple of awful botched executions where they didn't die</u>
<u n="2954" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="2955" who="S0454">and you know the heart stopped and they took I think half an hour to die or one poor man</u>
<u n="2956" who="S0579">yeah that's terrible isn't it?</u>
<u n="2957" who="S0454" trans="overlap">incredibly inhumane cos they'd never tested these drugs on people before and</u>
<u n="2958" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2959" who="S0454">it's all very well saying you tested it on a rabbit but a rabbit's not a human is it? so</u>
<u n="2960" who="S0579">no no</u>
<u n="2961" who="S0454">it might kill a rabbit that doesn't mean it's gonna kill a human in</u>

<u n="2967" who="S0454">dreadful you know the <trunc>p</trunc>person woke up in the middle and was in agonising pain and all sorts of things so they've had to call a a stop on most of them because they I mean what a mess</u>
<u n="2968" who="S0579">they don't have execution in the States now do they?</u>
<u n="2969" who="S0454">well they've stayed it in a lot of States because of this business with er lethal injections</u>
<u n="2970" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>

<u n="3058" who="S0579">well that's right actually that's yeah</u>
<u n="3059" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I mean and I suppose there's always a risk that that will happen</u>
<u n="3060" who="S0579" trans="overlap">they're going to be wrong yeah</u>
<u n="3061" who="S0454">yes and they might not've been very nice people</u>
<u n="3062" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>but</unclear></u>
<u n="3063" who="S0454">but that didn't mean that they did that</u>
<u n="3064" who="S0579">oh yes there was no evidence you wonder how did they get so put down then don't you? yes</u>

<u n="3067" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you know they sort of lived in a doss house and I suppose seemed a bit unsavoury they're probably petty <trunc>cri</trunc> you know petty criminals but</u>
<u n="3068" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah criminals probably yeah</u>
<u n="3069" who="S0454">petty criminal to terrorist is quite a jump <trunc>f</trunc></u>

<u n="3071" who="S0454">and probably not in their best interest</u>
<u n="3072" who="S0579"><vocal desc="laugh"/> no no no</u>
<u n="3073" who="S0454" trans="overlap">to draw attention but anyway there as a kind of racial prejudice there I suppose</u>
<u n="3074" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="3075" who="S0454">and the police are under enormous pressure under those you know when those crimes happen</u>
<u n="3076" who="S0579">yes</u>
<u n="3077" who="S0454">the funny thing was with that was the IRA stepped in and said they didn't do it we did it and they still jailed them the police still jailed them even though the IRA had confessed which is interesting isn't it?</u>
<u n="3078" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="3079" who="S0454">so the police just decided to ignore</u>
<u n="3080" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="3081" who="S0454">what they'd been told cos they were so desperate for a conviction and by that stage they had threatened and got false confessions out of the two boys er</u>
<u n="3082" who="S0579" trans="overlap">they didn't bump them off though did they?</u>
<u n="3083" who="S0454">no no they didn't but I mean that's an argument you know why we shouldn't have the death penalty</u>
<u n="3084" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no <unclear/> why we shouldn't yeah yeah</u>
<u n="3085" who="S0454">because at least I mean they're probably</u>
<u n="3086" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3087" who="S0454">traumatised but and they did spend years in prison but they did get out in the end</u>
<u n="3088" who="S0579">cos we don't have a death penalty now do we?</u>
<u n="3089" who="S0454">only for treason apparently we never got rid of it</u>
<u n="3090" who="S0579" trans="overlap">only for treason?</u>

<u n="3092" who="S0579">oh yeah that's right</u>
<u n="3093" who="S0454" trans="overlap">which is quite interesting cos treason could be used against terrorists presumably</u>
<u n="3094" who="S0579">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="3095" who="S0454">I mean you could say it was a crime against the state</u>
<u n="3096" who="S0579">yeah okay yeah treason if er</u>
<u n="3097" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes yes but we've never used it well not since the sixties and that was for murder that one that James Hanratty one</u>
<u n="3098" who="S0579">treason yeah</u>
<u n="3099" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="3100" who="S0579">it's murder seems a worse case than treason doesn't it?</u>

<u n="3103" who="S0454" trans="overlap">why why have we got it for treason and not for</u>
<u n="3104" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no no <unclear/> mm bumping somebody off</u>
<u n="3105" who="S0454" trans="overlap">bumping someone off yeah it does seem very odd</u>

<u n="3107" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="3108" who="S0579">used to be funny er it's odd how people behave here cos when we used to have these prison sentences when in the day when they had capital <trunc>pen</trunc> capital penalties people used to <trunc>c</trunc> er hang out outside the prisons hadn't they?</u>
<u n="3109" who="S0454">oh right</u>

<u n="3123" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so you <trunc>d</trunc> I mean it's another reason not to have it you don't really want to perpetuate that kind of</u>
<u n="3124" who="S0579">not really no no</u>
<u n="3125" who="S0454">no it's a bit like the old medieval days putting heads on spikes wasn't it and leave them outside the city walls?</u>

<u n="3128" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no no yes yeah that's right</u>
<u n="3129" who="S0454">but I suppose people have always been a bit gory like that</u>
<u n="3130" who="S0579">yeah that's right in those days they just cut people's heads off didn't they and <vocal desc="laugh"/> swords</u>
<u n="3131" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="3132" who="S0579" trans="overlap">rather than guns</u>
<u n="3133" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="3134" who="S0579">cos that brought a lot more deaths when we got the gun out</u>
<u n="3135" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="3136" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yes</u>
<u n="3137" who="S0454">well the Americans say they won't do it again</u>

<u n="3140" who="S0579"><vocal desc="laugh"/> probably I suppose that's so yes</u>
<u n="3141" who="S0454">you know the funny thing is</u>
<u n="3142" who="S0579">er</u>
<u n="3143" who="S0454">it's actually more expensive to execute prisoners than it is not to because of the legal proceedings in the States because they get an automatic right of appeal</u>
<u n="3144" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh yes right yeah they go on for ever yeah yeah</u>
<u n="3145" who="S0454">which they don't have to pay for</u>
<u n="3146" who="S0579" trans="overlap">go on for years doesn't it?</u>
<u n="3147" who="S0454">that goes on for years apparently the average stay on death row is ten to fifteen years</u>

<u n="3149" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it's horrific isn't it? those poor men yes well it's not all men but</u>
<u n="3150" who="S0579" trans="overlap">didn't they just recently bump somebody off not very long back?</u>
<u n="3151" who="S0454">yes I think they did</u>
<u n="3152" who="S0579">well after about twenty years I mean that sounds crazy to do that yeah yeah</u>
<u n="3153" who="S0454" trans="overlap">poor man yes <trunc>w</trunc> how awful to live your life with that hanging over you</u>
<u n="3154" who="S0579">yeah that's right but have a conviction twenty years later that sounds absurd</u>
<u n="3155" who="S0454">he seems to have served his time already whatever he did</u>
<u n="3156" who="S0579">well that's right yeah yeah</u>
<u n="3157" who="S0454" trans="overlap">in a way I mean you should just have a a statute of limitations which just said</u>
<u n="3158" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3159" who="S0454">if you spent more than fifteen years in prison</u>
<u n="3160" who="S0579">that's it yeah</u>

<u n="3162" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="3163" who="S0454">you know because it's just taking too long and that's</u>
<u n="3164" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3165" who="S0454">in itself a death sentence isn't it just</u>
<u n="3166" who="S0579" trans="overlap">you'd've thought so yeah</u>
<u n="3167" who="S0454">waiting like that?</u>

<u n="3169" who="S0454">I feel sorry for them</u>
<u n="3170" who="S0579" trans="overlap">then bump somebody off twenty years down the line sounds wrong doesn't it?</u>
<u n="3171" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah and the cost you see is it doesn't add up it's very very expensive to keep going back to court for the government</u>
<u n="3172" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="3173" who="S0454">doesn't add up at all but then prison is very ineffective <unclear/> was saying like they're</u>

<u n="3182" who="S0579">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="3183" who="S0454">yes they <trunc>s</trunc> use it against drug erm</u>
<u n="3184" who="S0579">drugs and</u>
<u n="3185" who="S0454">drug pushers a lot</u>
<u n="3186" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3187" who="S0454">mostly drug pushers also people suspected of terrorist activities</u>
<u n="3188" who="S0579">oh terrorists well you can bump those off I suppose</u>
<u n="3189" who="S0454" trans="overlap">but how but they torture prisoners in most of the Gulf countries so how many are actually rightfully convicted I I don't know I mean if you were tortured</u>
<u n="3190" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh yeah no no <unclear/> torture <unclear>oh no could be</unclear></u>
<u n="3191" who="S0454">you wonder how accurate these confessions really are you'd probably say anything after a while</u>

<u n="3193" who="S0454">and those prisons over there I mean</u>
<u n="3194" who="S0579">mean prisons yeah</u>

<u n="3196" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3197" who="S0454">paramedic and they used to take him into prisons a lot because a lot of the prisoners</u>

<u n="3202" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3203" who="S0454">like they treat them like animals and you would want to kill yourself and you probably would confess just to get better treatment in the end so</u>
<u n="3204" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3205" who="S0454">yes they convict a lot but how many are rightfully convicted</u>

<u n="3228" who="S0579">I suppose there is a certainty what you get then isn't it <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="3229" who="S0454">cos I just put my prices up yesterday and she doesn't know <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="3235" who="S0454" trans="overlap">or I could go in between <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3236" who="S0579">go in between that's right</u>

<u n="3445" who="S0454">yes so what would happen then is they would take the money out her account automatically</u>
<u n="3446" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh I see <unclear/></u>
<u n="3447" who="S0454" trans="overlap">immediately they would take that out her account but I don't see that money</u>

<u n="3449" who="S0454">until the day after she checks in</u>

<u n="3452" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3453" who="S0454">she could then email the company and say <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> doesn't exist</u>
<u n="3454" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3455" who="S0454">I want my money back and she would get it back</u>

<u n="3458" who="S0579">oh probably yes <unclear/></u>
<u n="3459" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah so that way they hold onto the money and then on the second night of her stay they release the whole amount</u>
<u n="3460" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="3461" who="S0454">even though that's a month ahead</u>

<u n="3520" who="S0579">I remember years and years ago when you <unclear/> those things you used to you used to have disks and you play them on disks and gave you some information I've forgotten how that used to work</u>
<u n="3521" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="3522" who="S0579">I know we had some of the early machines in our office <pause dur="short"/> but that's yes <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="3523" who="S0454">okay so I'll just save that <pause dur="short"/> at the moment <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>

<u n="3531" who="S0454">so they've got her money</u>
<u n="3532" who="S0579" trans="overlap">so and it just makes satisfaction the other end and that's it yeah</u>
<u n="3533" who="S0454">yeah so then they just hold it and check basically that she's checked in although they don't ever email them to check</u>
<u n="3534" who="S0579" trans="overlap">check in yeah</u>
<u n="3535" who="S0454">they just expect the customer to email them if there's a problem</u>
<u n="3536" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><trunc>c</trunc> to do it yeah</u>
<u n="3537" who="S0454">and then after that they'll send me the full amount goodness me so it says total eight hundred pounds not bad is it? but how many months is that? I don't quite understand this actually <pause dur="short"/> it says the total is eight hundred pounds but they're taking a hundred pounds commission which is quite a lot that's a bit annoying <pause dur="short"/> so I earn seven hundred pounds so I earn seven hundred pounds</u>
<u n="3538" who="S0579" trans="overlap">you er do you have to say accept it or not?</u>
<u n="3539" who="S0454">yes I'm just trying to do the maths</u>

<u n="3549" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah this is amazing isn't it really?</u>
<u n="3550" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="3551" who="S0454">so she wants from the seventeenth of April so let's count the weeks that's one week two three <pause dur="short"/> four five six</u>
<u n="3552" who="S0579" trans="overlap">do they do they enclose recommendations from somewhere to show it's okay?</u>
<u n="3553" who="S0454">usually</u>
<u n="3554" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3555" who="S0454">seven <pause dur="short"/> I think it's seven weeks she wants till the first of June that's not quite right <pause dur="short"/> okay so she wants seventeenth of April one two <pause dur="long"/> right one</u>
<u n="3556" who="S0579" trans="overlap">I suppose erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> when when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s off to university somewhere she'll have spare space in her room</u>
<u n="3557" who="S0454">yes I asked her about that</u>
<u n="3558" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3559" who="S0454">having trouble working this out <pause dur="short"/> four five six looks like six weeks seven days <pause dur="short"/> six week sorry six weeks and three days <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> <pause dur="short"/> so six weeks and three days so that's six weeks six times seven forty-two <pause dur="short"/> forty-five nights isn't it? let's work that out a night <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="3560" who="S0579">forty-four nights it is is it?</u>
<u n="3561" who="S0454" trans="overlap">forty-four nights is it?</u>
<u n="3562" who="S0579" trans="overlap">is it? <trunc>s</trunc>seven days and times six is forty-two</u>
<u n="3563" who="S0454">forty-two plus three</u>
<u n="3564" who="S0579">yeah plus three yeah</u>
<u n="3565" who="S0454">okay so if we go to calculator <pause dur="short"/> so what did we say? forty-two plus three forty-five so I get six hundred and ninety-five divided by <pause dur="short"/> forty-five say so it works out as fifteen a night not brilliant</u>
<u n="3566" who="S0579">doesn't sound brilliant no <trunc>s</trunc> no</u>
<u n="3567" who="S0454">no but that's because I think I've put in a discount if someone books a month</u>
<u n="3568" who="S0579">oh I see</u>
<u n="3569" who="S0454">maybe I need to check that actually</u>
<u n="3570" who="S0579">do they pay up front on these things?</u>
<u n="3571" who="S0454">yeah so that's the advantage</u>
<u n="3572" who="S0579">oh yeah I see <unclear/></u>
<u n="3573" who="S0454" trans="overlap">even if she cancels</u>
<u n="3574" who="S0579"><unclear/> you <unclear>can put it up and not let</unclear> can't you?</u>
<u n="3575" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I would get yeah she can still cancel up to a week ahead</u>
<u n="3576" who="S0579" trans="overlap">your cancellation <pause dur="short"/> oh can they?</u>
<u n="3577" who="S0454">and I think</u>
<u n="3578" who="S0579">even if they sent the money to you</u>
<u n="3579" who="S0454">they hold the money</u>
<u n="3580" who="S0579">oh they hold the money? oh well</u>
<u n="3581" who="S0454">but I think I get a percentage still like fifty percent</u>
<u n="3582" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="3583" who="S0454">but I'm not sure but if she cancels with less than a week's notice she doesn't get a penny back</u>
<u n="3584" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="3585" who="S0454">I get nearly all of it</u>
<u n="3586" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <unclear>a great deal</unclear></u>
<u n="3587" who="S0454">yeah fifteen a night's not great <pause dur="short"/> but then it is seven hundred pounds up front which is quite</u>
<u n="3588" who="S0579" trans="overlap">it is seven yes</u>
<u n="3589" who="S0454">it is yes it is quite a lot of money suppose the other thing I can do er just check <trunc>t</trunc> <unclear><trunc>n</trunc> the other dates</unclear> first er <pause dur="short"/> so it's <unclear/></u>
<u n="3590" who="S0579" trans="overlap">and <trunc>c</trunc> well if you if you say no do they come back with a fresh offer sometimes?</u>
<u n="3591" who="S0454">well no it's my fault you see because I can put in discounts but I can't really go the other way</u>
<u n="3592" who="S0579">oh I see yes</u>
<u n="3593" who="S0454">so I've put in a figure per night which is twenty pounds a night at the moment</u>
<u n="3594" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3595" who="S0454">but I've also put in if someone <trunc>p</trunc> stays for a week then I'll discount them this amount and if they stay for a month</u>
<u n="3596" who="S0579">you <unclear>send them</unclear> another one</u>
<u n="3597" who="S0454">then I'll discount them this amount because that way I know every single night's booked</u>
<u n="3598" who="S0579" trans="overlap">is covered yes</u>
<u n="3599" who="S0454">and also that I'm not doing very much work</u>
<u n="3600" who="S0579">no</u>
<u n="3601" who="S0454">cos I'm doing is changing the sheets once a week and giving them fresh towels whereas</u>
<u n="3602" who="S0579">yes</u>
<u n="3603" who="S0454">if someone comes</u>
<u n="3604" who="S0579">oh you've gotta change all the time</u>
<u n="3605" who="S0454" trans="overlap">a different person each night</u>
<u n="3606" who="S0579">yes</u>
<u n="3607" who="S0454">that's actually quite a lot of work and I've got to be there</u>
<u n="3608" who="S0579" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="3609" who="S0454">if she's in all the time</u>
<u n="3610" who="S0579" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="3611" who="S0454">I don't have to be there</u>
<u n="3612" who="S0579">no</u>
<u n="3613" who="S0454">but if someone's coming every night then I've got to be there to give them a key I've got to show them round I've got to wash the sheets got to</u>
<u n="3614" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh that's a bit of a nuisance</u>
<u n="3615" who="S0454">yeah so really you don't want people changing all the time cos it's a nuisance</u>
<u n="3616" who="S0579" trans="overlap">not one night no no fifteen nights <unclear>and seven</unclear> yeah</u>
<u n="3617" who="S0454">but this this perhaps I don't know what to do about this <pause dur="short"/> yes trouble is as well with someone staying that long is you might not like them</u>
<u n="3618" who="S0579" trans="overlap">cos you don't don't you don't have to meet people before then? yeah so <unclear/></u>
<u n="3619" who="S0454" trans="overlap">no but normally they just stay a night or two</u>
<u n="3620" who="S0579">oh I see</u>
<u n="3621" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so then you don't really mind if someone's staying much longer then I suppose you might mind I think I'll have a look at my offers actually see what I've put it in at</u>
<u n="3622" who="S0579">cos they if they'd paid for longer do they pay upfront?</u>
<u n="3623" who="S0454">erm yes they still pay but it's paid into their account Airbnb's account not into my personal account</u>
<u n="3624" who="S0579" trans="overlap">I see yeah <pause dur="long"/> so your money's always it's secure like that is it?</u>
<u n="3625" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="3626" who="S0579">yeah <pause dur="long"/> do you employ estate agents on that do you?</u>
<u n="3627" who="S0454">no they do it all for me</u>
<u n="3628" who="S0579">all by itself do they?</u>
<u n="3629" who="S0454">they advertise it for me</u>
<u n="3630" who="S0579">oh pretty good isn't it?</u>
<u n="3631" who="S0454" trans="overlap">they send a photographer round for me professional one for free</u>
<u n="3632" who="S0579">gosh that's that's very good</u>
<u n="3633" who="S0454">he's coming on Monday</u>
<u n="3634" who="S0579">yeah so that's very good</u>
<u n="3635" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and then they upload all the photos for me I don't own the photos then of course they own them</u>
<u n="3636" who="S0579">yeah course yeah</u>
<u n="3637" who="S0454">it's not bad is it?</u>
<u n="3638" who="S0579">very good going yeah</u>
<u n="3639" who="S0454">I mean the other thing is it's a three-bedroom house</u>
<u n="3640" who="S0579">oh yes yeah</u>
<u n="3641" who="S0454">so I could rent out the other room and sleep in the third one</u>
<u n="3642" who="S0579">oh or could camp outside</u>
<u n="3643" who="S0454">yes because that way actually</u>
<u n="3644" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="3645" who="S0454">I could double my money couldn't I?</u>
<u n="3646" who="S0579" trans="overlap">double your money I can see that yeah</u>
<u n="3647" who="S0454">because what I'm doing now is I'm renting the middle room not the biggest which I've got</u>
<u n="3648" who="S0579" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="3649" who="S0454">and not the smallest</u>
<u n="3650" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="3651" who="S0454">which no one's in but I could rent out <pause dur="short"/> the two big <trunc>on</trunc> the middle one and the big one and I could charge twenty-five pounds a night for the big one</u>
<u n="3652" who="S0579">yes</u>
<u n="3653" who="S0454">and then whenever I get a booking there I could move into the small room myself</u>
<u n="3654" who="S0579"><trunc>d</trunc>do you have them for that length of time then do you? sometimes?</u>
<u n="3655" who="S0454">this is unusual but I'm getting a lot of people who want to book longer term</u>
<u n="3656" who="S0579">oh yeah so</u>
<u n="3657" who="S0454">yes I'm not quite sure about this because it's I <trunc>d</trunc> you see the trouble is because I've put in that discount that might've been a mistake</u>
<u n="3658" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3659" who="S0454">I probably shouldn't've put in such a big discount I want to check what I did actually <pause dur="short"/> right I'm gonna copy that text and check what I've done with the <pause dur="short"/> erm discounts cos I can't remember but that does seem possible</u>
<u n="3660" who="S0579" trans="overlap">does that mean it's been done all now though? that whole <unclear>deal</unclear>?</u>
<u n="3661" who="S0454" trans="overlap">no I haven't <trunc>replie</trunc> I've just I just want to know I just did the maths</u>
<u n="3662" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>oh that's it</unclear></u>
<u n="3663" who="S0454">that's quite a lot less than I would be getting otherwise but then I suppose I could rent out the third room</u>
<u n="3664" who="S0579">oh no you no you'd be <trunc>m</trunc> a millionaire in no time</u>
<u n="3665" who="S0454">yes grandpa just think <vocal desc="laugh"/> you could rent out these and make a fortune</u>
<u n="3666" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yeah I know that's yeah that's right yes buy another house</u>
<u n="3667" who="S0454">I know I did think that and you know this is all tax free? the government's just changed it in this budget that you can earn up to seven thousand something or other a year from renting a room out in the house that you live in</u>
<u n="3668" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3669" who="S0454">without paying tax</u>
<u n="3670" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="3671" who="S0454">which is huge I mean you'd be hard pressed to earn seven thousand pounds by renting out a room</u>
<u n="3672" who="S0579">yes</u>
<u n="3673" who="S0454">have to have someone here every night</u>
<u n="3674" who="S0579">well well that sounds rather good</u>
<u n="3675" who="S0454">yeah so that's very good and even if you go over the erm</u>
<u n="3676" who="S0579">seven thousand</u>
<u n="3677" who="S0454" trans="overlap">seven thousand you would pay tax but then you could claim wear and tear so what I'm not allowed to do is claim wear and tear with this because I'm not paying tax</u>
<u n="3678" who="S0579">I see yeah</u>
<u n="3679" who="S0454">but I don't have to put it on my tax return they said it's completely tax free and it's it's outside of the</u>
<u n="3680" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh so you don't have to worry then? mm yeah</u>
<u n="3681" who="S0454">and it's all through a site so if I needed to account for it I can show you know that's what I earned</u>
<u n="3682" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3683" who="S0454">here are the <trunc>recei</trunc> they give me receipts they give me VAT receipts it's all good</u>
<u n="3684" who="S0579">oh pretty good going yeah</u>
<u n="3685" who="S0454">but that's a very nice thing I said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she should do it when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> goes cos it's a nice source of income</u>
<u n="3686" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="3687" who="S0454">right let's have a look</u>
<u n="3688" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>let's see if we can find</unclear> some more property owners</u>
<u n="3689" who="S0454">calendar</u>
<u n="3690" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3691" who="S0454">and more <pause dur="short"/> yes sorry this is a bit boring but I could make eight hundred pounds in five minutes</u>
<u n="3692" who="S0579">yeah it's good isn't it?</u>
<u n="3693" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="3694" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3695" who="S0454">okay so let's see pricing so I'm <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="3696" who="S0579" trans="overlap">does the money come through automatically now then?</u>
<u n="3697" who="S0454">ah I see that's what I've done</u>
<u n="3698" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3699" who="S0454">it will come through when she checks in so it says I've set it at twenty pounds a night</u>
<u n="3700" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3701" who="S0454">the website thinks I should set it at twenty-one pounds a night cos what it does it it calculates the average price in the area</u>
<u n="3702" who="S0579">oh I see <unclear/></u>
<u n="3703" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and based on my rating so it it's told me when I started off I should put it at fifteen and it told me go to eighteen</u>
<u n="3704" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="3705" who="S0454">and last week it told me go to twenty-one and I went to twenty last night <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3706" who="S0579">oh <trunc>w</trunc>why how do they <trunc>g</trunc> just <unclear>start off</unclear> all the other prices <unclear>then</unclear>? <unclear/></u>
<u n="3707" who="S0454" trans="overlap">erm well I suppose the first one they just guess</u>
<u n="3708" who="S0579">oh I see yeah</u>
<u n="3709" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and then they get the next one and then they</u>
<u n="3710" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="3711" who="S0454">calculate how many bookings each place gets and they calculate the you know automatically</u>
<u n="3712" who="S0579">they er</u>
<u n="3713" who="S0454">the maximum market rate</u>
<u n="3714" who="S0579">oh I see</u>
<u n="3715" who="S0454">which is sustainable so they've worked out that for my type of property I I could charge twenty-one now</u>
<u n="3716" who="S0579">oh yeah</u>
<u n="3717" who="S0454">a night because I've had lots of bookings so they know I'm popular</u>
<u n="3718" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah popular yeah</u>
<u n="3719" who="S0454">yes but I said I'd give ten percent discount on a weekly and twenty percent I said on monthly so that's why they said I should do twenty-seven percent <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="3720" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="3721" who="S0454">I need to put that down don't I?</u>

<u n="3730" who="S0579">oh well that sounds reasonable enough doesn't it?</u>
