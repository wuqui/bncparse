<u n="750" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="751" who="S0618">that goes on in society <pause dur="short"/> and I'm thinking of another thing as well that was Facebook again there was some video about a guy did an experiment just wandering round restaurants stopping at people's table as people are eating outside and saying <trunc>r</trunc> I'm really hungry can I have a slice of your pizza? now <pause dur="short"/> I would tell anybody to fuck off <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="758" who="S0619" trans="overlap">you know and if the person next to you says yes then you go oh do I have to say yes because they said yes? or do I have to say no because they've already said yes so it's okay?</u>
<u n="759" who="S0618" trans="overlap">no</u>

<u n="761" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="762" who="S0619">what the person on the next table is doing er <vocal desc="sigh"/> it's difficult erm I was on holiday once in Bulgaria and we went to Sofia and it was there were a lot of <pause dur="short"/> there was a lot of poverty and kids would if you were eating outside just come and touch the food on your plate with you know sort of dirty hands</u>
<u n="763" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="764" who="S0619">and then because that happens then you go have the food</u>
<u n="765" who="S0618">yeah</u>
<u n="766" who="S0619">and that was how they made food</u>
<u n="767" who="S0618" trans="overlap">that's not nice</u>
<u n="768" who="S0619">yeah</u>
<u n="769" who="S0618">mm <pause dur="short"/> I mean in that situation it's unfortunate that hunger</u>

<u n="779" who="S0618">mm</u>
<u n="780" who="S0619" trans="overlap">well that's what these kids did all day every day <pause dur="short"/> so er you know who are they feeding <pause dur="short"/> with all this this food?</u>
<u n="781" who="S0618" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="782" who="S0619">and they must be sort of getting a lot I dunno</u>

<u n="785" who="S0618">like everything in life I intend an abundance for myself and food money clothes everything I need to survive but I intend an abundance and also intend that I might share that abundance with other people</u>
<u n="786" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="787" who="S0618">and that doesn't necessarily mean giving money to people who are living on the street or whatever erm that might mean you know buying a coffee for a friend once in a while</u>

<u n="789" who="S0618">or a meal or a whatever erm <pause dur="short"/> but I find <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> <pause dur="short"/> I'm kind of conflicted about people who live on the street or people who are homeless because in many respects I recognise they've created lack for themselves and have an experience that they're experiencing and growing from and learning from so if I look at that person as other self and look at us both as an aspect of the divine or an aspect of source or</u>

<u n="793" who="S0618">bearded sitting on a cloud patriarchal overtones but whatever you wanna call it this energy of all that is I look on that self as another self that person as another self and think right okay they're experiencing lack they've chosen that experience to learn <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> in this lifetime or whatever <pause dur="short"/> and I kind of feel if I give <pause dur="short"/> money there's an energetic imbalance there because what do I get in return? and it's not <pause dur="short"/> that sounds really selfish and it is in a way but I like when you said about your student saying do a bit of gardening for me</u>
<u n="794" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="795" who="S0618">and I'll give you some food and some money I like that a lot more <pause dur="short"/> and I think if I give money without asking for anything in return like a bit of gardening for example</u>
<u n="796" who="S0619" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="797" who="S0618">there's such an energetic imbalance there for me and for that person and I don't quite know how to go about that if I'm going to give money I would much rather give it to a project</u>
<u n="798" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="799" who="S0618">that works with people to help</u>

<u n="832" who="S0619">mm <pause dur="short"/> it has to be your own choice</u>
<u n="833" who="S0618">mm and be</u>

<u n="853" who="S0618">erm <pause dur="short"/> so I will do that quite a lot erm when I see people in that situation generally won't give money and I always project erm kind of this pink light or energy of love and wish and intend the highest and best outcome for that person</u>
<u n="854" who="S0619">mm</u>
<u n="855" who="S0618">now it might be that in their string of incarnations they've chosen this particular lifetime to experience lacked experience</u>
