<u n="1" who="S0058">so good stuff <pause dur="short"/> er what were we just talking about?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0179">dunno <pause dur="short"/> something probably <pause dur="short"/> back on?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh those traffic lights <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> cutting through them</u>
<u n="4" who="S0179">wasn't a riveting topic of conversation</u>
<u n="5" who="S0058">no it wasn't <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="6" who="S0179">to start on</u>
<u n="7" who="S0058">ah <pause dur="short"/> ten degrees <pause dur="short"/> it's gone up <pause dur="long"/> Maybe go to that Thai restaurant? It was quite nice</u>
<u n="8" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> it was alright</u>
<u n="9" who="S0058">no I mean as as in as an event not the food was fine but the um</u>
<u n="10" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was quite nice</u>
<u n="11" who="S0058">was quite nice <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I like it in there <pause dur="short"/> the atmosphere's kind of fun and it's kinda different <pause dur="short"/> even er yeah I mean the food's fine but it was nice <unclear/></u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="12" who="S0179"></u>
<u n="13" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0058">yeah it is <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> very cunning</u>
<u n="16" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh no <pause dur="short"/> that's not gonna help</u>
<u n="17" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="18" who="S0179">well no it's marginally safer for us but and therefore them <pause dur="short"/> but you know</u>
<u n="19" who="S0058">I always think <anon type="place"/> is a particularly depressing name for a place</u>
<u n="20" who="S0179">sorry?</u>
<u n="21" who="S0058"><anon type="place"/> is a particularly er depressing name for a place</u>
<u n="22" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="23" who="S0058">A town where it rains <pause dur="short"/> it probably doesn't mean that but</u>
<u n="24" who="S0179">this is just such a frustrating road <pause dur="short"/> why is there why okay it's got some crossroads but it doesn't need to be a fifty</u>
<u n="25" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0179">aha <pause dur="short"/> the road reads my mind</u>
<u n="27" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="28" who="S0179">wow</u>
<u n="29" who="S0058">exactly <pause dur="short"/> handy when it does that <pause dur="short"/> it'd be great if it was like oh this road is too busy and suddenly all the cars come off</u>
<u n="30" who="S0179">where would they go to?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0058">just away <pause dur="short"/> doesn't matter <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="32" who="S0179">uh <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="33" who="S0058">ah the bus <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> See that number twenty right? It starts on Durham Road understandably <pause dur="short"/> and um then you think oh well we're <unclear/> Durham <pause dur="short"/> that was really quick <pause dur="short"/> that's a great service <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> then it goes round every single little town on either side of this road <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> All the way there <pause dur="short"/> it's so frustrating</u>
<u n="34" who="S0179">how long does it take?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0058">um <pause dur="short"/> about an hour</u>
<u n="36" who="S0179">wow</u>
<u n="37" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="38" who="S0179">but you'd think they'd have the bus which went straight there and then a bus that did some of them and then bus that did the others</u>
<u n="39" who="S0058">I <trunc>th</trunc> I don't think there is an express to Durham <pause dur="short"/> there's certainly an express to Newcastle <pause dur="short"/> but I don't think there's one to Durham</u>
<u n="40" who="S0179"><unclear/> there's a tram to Newcastle</u>
<u n="41" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0179">there's not many other transport links to Durham</u>
<u n="43" who="S0058">no <pause dur="short"/> no exactly <pause dur="short"/> and it's really annoying <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> As in the the only other way to do it is to get get a train to Newcastle and a train to Durham <pause dur="short"/> like which is that's it</u>
<u n="44" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="45" who="S0058">er as it I mean as it happens it's relatively handy for us cos we live so close to <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> so you just hop on a bus <pause dur="short"/> but then once you're on the bus <vocal desc="laugh"/> that's where the fun starts</u>
<u n="46" who="S0179">that's clever</u>
<u n="47" who="S0058">that's a stupid sign</u>
<u n="48" who="S0179">what?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0058">there's a house a sign for a housing development saying if you lived here you'd be home by now <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Yes <pause dur="short"/> yes thank you</u>
<u n="50" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="51" who="S0058">I know <pause dur="short"/> but it just <vocal desc="laugh"/> seems really just seems quite random</u>
<u n="52" who="S0179">well er so there's a</u>
<u n="53" who="S0058">oh a trainline?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0058">fair enough</u>
<u n="56" who="S0179">the <trunc>o</trunc> well no but there was one on the Thameslink train <pause dur="short"/> but no it er makes more sense when you're driving <pause dur="short"/> but it didn't make sense on the Thameslink one <pause dur="short"/> cos it was like if you lived here you'd be home now <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> we'd have to go to the next station</u>
<u n="57" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="58" who="S0179">which is sort of five minutes away <pause dur="short"/> then get somehow get back</u>
<u n="59" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0179">so actually it's probably at the bare minimum a quarter of an hour</u>
<u n="61" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0179">by which time I'll be home anyway</u>
<u n="63" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="64" who="S0179">so <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="65" who="S0058">nice <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Foiled</u>
<u n="66" who="S0179">yeah at most living there would save me five minutes</u>
<u n="67" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> so actually I don't think I will if that's all the <trunc>s</trunc> all the same to you</u>
<u n="68" who="S0179">and the surrounding neighbourhood looks like a shithole</u>
<u n="69" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="70" who="S0179">and I know this cos I take the train through there every day</u>
<u n="71" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Nice <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> they can't hide the true er reality from the commuters</u>
<u n="72" who="S0179">indeed</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="73" who="S0058">quite busy on the twenty tonight</u>
<u n="74" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> six miles Sunderland</u>
<u n="75" who="S0058">yay</u>
<u n="76" who="S0179">oh dear</u>
<u n="77" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh</u>
<u n="78" who="S0179">this this bit of <vocal desc="laugh"/> road is really</u>
<u n="79" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0179">boring</u>
<u n="81" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's a rubbish tip to the left here as we go past it</u>
<u n="82" who="S0179">yay</u>
<u n="83" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Well it used to be anyway <pause dur="short"/> I dunno if it still is</u>
<u n="84" who="S0179">living it up tonight</u>
<u n="85" who="S0058">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> all the sights <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I love how we er we haven't seen the cathedral <pause dur="short"/> we've seen the rubbish tip <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0179">cathedral?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0058">Durham Cathedral</u>
<u n="88" who="S0179">oh right</u>
<u n="89" who="S0058">not Sunderland cathedral</u>
<u n="90" who="S0179">I was gonna say <pause dur="short"/> there isn't one</u>
<u n="91" who="S0058">no there isn't <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="92" who="S0179">and yet it is a city just</u>
<u n="93" who="S0058">it's got a minster <pause dur="short"/> dunno if that makes any difference</u>
<u n="94" who="S0179">that sounds very camp</u>
<u n="95" who="S0058">does it?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0179">mincer</u>
<u n="97" who="S0058">oh right <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I was gonna say how? Um <pause dur="short"/> I was gonna say it sounds like minister so I got really confused <pause dur="short"/> I think Newcastle has a cathedral <pause dur="short"/> I think I sang in it <unclear/></u>
<u n="98" who="S0179">well it must do</u>
<u n="99" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I I think I sang in it</u>
<u n="100" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="101" who="S0058">it might not have been a cathedral <pause dur="short"/> that might've been just a big church <pause dur="short"/> it was a while ago</u>
<u n="102" who="S0179">so the original logic for placing cathedrals was just where are there enough people we can screw over</u>
<u n="103" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="104" who="S0179">to get enough money to build this thing?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0179">oo cities <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> er um</u>
<u n="107" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="109" who="S0058">areas where there's already lots of people</u>
<u n="110" who="S0179">sorry?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0058">areas where there's already lots of people <pause dur="short"/> it wasn't build a cathedral then they'd come flocking round it <pause dur="short"/> it was er build the cathedral where the people are</u>
<u n="112" who="S0179">well to some extent you got people making pilgrimages</u>
<u n="113" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0179">and just sort of not having any money to get home</u>
<u n="115" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="116" who="S0179">I doubt that was a <unclear/> but</u>
<u n="117" who="S0058">well you er er there would be a tourism industry <pause dur="short"/> like Canterbury probably had a massive tourist industry in <trunc>m</trunc> er medieval times</u>
<u n="118" who="S0179">wow <pause dur="short"/> canterbury <pause dur="short"/> the place to be</u>
<u n="119" who="S0058">well yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0179">in fifteen hundred</u>
<u n="121" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Apparently <pause dur="short"/> according to Chaucer <pause dur="short"/> no earlier than fifteen um but yeah they're all on  the on the on  the <trunc>j</trunc> er on their jollies off to Canterbury</u>
<u n="122" who="S0179">on their jollies?</u>
<u n="123" who="S0058">jollies</u>
<u n="124" who="S0179">oh right <pause dur="short"/> oh that's <unclear/> roundabout</u>
<u n="125" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="126" who="S0179">I'm so glad that this bit of road is forty <pause dur="short"/> it's it's</u>
<u n="127" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Not twenty</u>
<u n="128" who="S0179">this is the right speed for this road</u>
<u n="129" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0179"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yes <pause dur="short"/> indeed <pause dur="short"/> I can see that happening <unclear/></u>
<u n="131" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="132" who="S0179">there's er a bit of road on my work way to work that's a fifty <pause dur="short"/> there's no reason for it</u>
<u n="133" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Random speed limit</u>
<u n="134" who="S0179">it is conceivably at least to do with a section of road they haven't put as a fifty</u>
<u n="135" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="136" who="S0179"><trunc>s</trunc> fifty</u>
<u n="137" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> do you think they got the work experience kid to do the sign so they got it wrong?</u>
<u n="138" who="S0179">no I just think they're utterly retarded</u>
<u n="139" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yep <pause dur="short"/> that also</u>
<u n="140" who="S0179">the work experience kid'd be far too sensible</u>
<u n="141" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> The work experience kid would be worried about getting it right and wrong <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Instead of just  speed restrictions on</u>
<u n="142" who="S0179"><unclear/> that there was at some point an accident along there</u>
<u n="143" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0179">but</u>
<u n="145" who="S0058">maybe local pressure?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0179">but from who? No one lives along that section</u>
<u n="147" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Well</u>
<u n="148" who="S0179">I mean the only other logic I can see is that there's a pub on that section <pause dur="short"/> but it's got a really visible entrance way</u>
<u n="149" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="150" who="S0179">so that's hardly an issue <pause dur="short"/> and the only other <trunc>c</trunc> possible logic could be that if you dropped to a fifty then to a forty you're more likely to obey the forty through the village <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="151" who="S0058">no er</u>
<u n="152" who="S0179">I'd have thought a speed camera would've <vocal desc="laugh"/> done that far more effectively</u>
<u n="153" who="S0058">I was gonna say it's a little bit kind of er ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Bit excessive</u>
<u n="154" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> but to be honest er it's generally sufficiently busy such that if you obey the fifty and then you catch up with traffic ahead of you anyway</u>
<u n="155" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0179">so doesn't make a huge difference</u>
<u n="157" who="S0058">mm</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="158" who="S0179">uh <pause dur="short"/> this house is</u>
<u n="159" who="S0058">oh really? I've never really noticed it before</u>
<u n="160" who="S0179">location's not brilliant</u>
<u n="161" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="162" who="S0179">as in where you live is er quite nice cos it's feasible to walk into the centre</u>
<u n="163" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> here you</u>
<u n="164" who="S0179">not so much <unclear/></u>
<u n="165" who="S0058">no <pause dur="short"/> and it's a bit of a er a nowhere place <pause dur="short"/> you're right next to McDonald's and the <unclear/> station but not an awful lot else</u>
<u n="166" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="167" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you'd have to have er some like get a bike <pause dur="short"/> still <pause dur="short"/> nice looking houses</u>
<u n="168" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah well <unclear/></u>
<u n="169" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0179"><unclear/> oo it's a junction <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> forty?</u>
<u n="171" who="S0058">oh it's a Nissan as well <pause dur="short"/> how embarrassing</u>
<u n="172" who="S0179">it's a Nissan Juke</u>
<u n="173" who="S0058">did you see the er the newscast of them getting all the extra jobs?</u>
<u n="174" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="175" who="S0058">Cos they're gonna build the next <unclear/></u>
<u n="176" who="S0179">excuse me</u>
<u n="177" who="S0058">in er</u>
<u n="178" who="S0179">forty <pause dur="short"/> understand <pause dur="short"/> four zero <pause dur="short"/> straight over the road is zero traffic <pause dur="short"/> I'm assuming that some of those lights were gonna change</u>
<u n="179" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="180" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="181" who="S0058">they were just rubbish</u>
<u n="182" who="S0179">oh got it <pause dur="short"/> well done</u>
<u n="183" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="184" who="S0179">oh dear <pause dur="short"/> I should be more tolerant <pause dur="short"/> it's just been quite a long drive</u>
<u n="185" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="186" who="S0179">that's just been a short driving distance but nonetheless</u>
<u n="187" who="S0058">it's gone very quick hasn't it</u>
<u n="188" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> eerily so</u>

<u n="190" who="S0179">oo <pause dur="short"/> thank heavens <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> going off the line first</u>
<u n="191" who="S0058">you don't think this Juke'll be speedy?</u>
<u n="192" who="S0179">well not if there's a car in front of us <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="193" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="194" who="S0179">and this car's very quick from standstill</u>
