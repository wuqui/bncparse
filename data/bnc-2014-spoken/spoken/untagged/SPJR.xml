<u n="1" who="S0525">so your dad rang a couple of hours ago <pause dur="short"/> and erm</u>
<u n="2" who="S0615">got there alright then?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0525">yes he texted me last night probably about half eleven to say they were there <pause dur="short"/> but what I didn't realise is they are not actually on the site they are at the docks where the pipes were delivered and they've got to erm sort out six hundred pipes clean them all out and put end caps on them because the customer won't pay</u>
<u n="4" who="S0615" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> how long is that going to take himthen?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0525">well your dad said it's horrendous it's going to take forever he says they haven't got end caps for a start they've been nicked or they've fallen off or they didn't come with them which is a problem that we always used to have erm there's a big box of like rubber end caps but they can't make them fit so your dad had gone out to get more calor gas from a local shop because they are using like a a Canusa type torch to melt down the rubber to try and get it to stick onto the pipe so</u>
<u n="6" who="S0615" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>excellent</unclear></u>
<u n="7" who="S0525">almost like welding it on <trunc>an</trunc> and I don't know <trunc>wha</trunc> he says it's absolutely awful <pause dur="short"/> he said it was quite a nice day up there so I don't think they've had the rain that we had here luckily but he says erm the customer wants to take eight pipes next week he said but er of course we can't <pause dur="short"/> they can't leave the docks until the customer pays the Vat I said well of course they can't and the Vat is two hundred and thirty thousand on that first lot apparently there's six more deliveries coming in next well in ten days' time and they won't be able to shift these so no wonder he's got like a a small posse of people up there on site</u>
<u n="8" who="S0615" trans="overlap">it was lovely up there yesterday <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> so they'll probably never get onto site then in the next couple of days he's just taken them up to do this</u>
<u n="9" who="S0525">well yeah once they do get on to site that's when they need somebody else there to record the delivery notes correctly <pause dur="short"/> I mean we never had to do this before this this is this is just stalling tactics for not paying I can't</u>
<u n="10" who="S0615">oh</u>
<u n="11" who="S0525">you know a pipe is a pipe they've gotta they've gotta flush it through before they use it anyway you have to you know bung water through at high pressure which cleans out all the rubbish tests all the joints I mean that's standard procedure and I am assuming it's a drinking water pipe if it's sewerage well there's even less need to <vocal desc="laugh"/> so I don't know why they are having to do all of this or why <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has agreed to do it all I notice is is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is well out of the way he's he's never up there I suppose he's <trunc>he</trunc> I bet he's washed his hands of it he got the job and he's thinking do whatever</u>

<u n="310" who="S0615">yes</u>
<u n="311" who="S0525">because for a start it will need to be fairly central you don't want to be miles away from like the tour that we wanted to do and I don't know where it is situated so things like that we will need to look at surely</u>
<u n="312" who="S0615" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's rather <unclear/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="313" who="S0525">well and it and what the car hire costs would be because erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s trips included that so by the time you've paid <trunc>th</trunc>the airfare and the fees</u>
<u n="314" who="S0615" trans="overlap">it is I know <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah no it's not far off what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> quoted but just it what you know kind of accommodation obviously that you know that might be a better place because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was like oh yeah we'll save money because we will like cook in the house and stuff and I'm like well yeah you could do that <vocal desc="sigh"/> it it looks like you are saving money because that's the thing you know probably you know things I'd say well probably not because by the time you've paid for everything extra even when you do everything bit by bit rather than just all in one <vocal desc="yawn"/></u>
<u n="315" who="S0525" trans="overlap"><trunc>ye</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes and that's right <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="yawn"/> <pause dur="short"/> that's right <pause dur="short"/> well that's why I'm thinking we need to research what it would be to car hire and do the trips because if it's going to come out really expensive then you are better off stopping at at a hotel</u>
<u n="316" who="S0615">but that's like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he said he got the price or?</u>
<u n="317" who="S0525">yeah you see yes that's what I mean <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s price included that's what I'm saying so if we go down the a B and B route then we need to price up try and get an idea of how much the trips would be if we did them ourselves just to sort of see if we are saving money or not because we don't want to end up paying a lot more do we?</u>
<u n="318" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="319" who="S0525">and you've probably got bed and breakfast in the hotel so that's your breakfast sorted so that's why I mean we need to have a little meeting and I I said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I said well me and your dad are easy on dates I said erm you and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> probably can sort of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will be I said it's really going to depend on erm waiting to find out exactly what <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is doing and so she's got an actual although do you know it's going to be Monday Tuesday Wednesday?</u>

<u n="321" who="S0525">you do know that?</u>
<u n="322" who="S0615">yeah</u>
<u n="323" who="S0525">but anyway I'm sure <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will be able to be flexible with his as well because she's only talking about four days plus a <trunc>we</trunc> you know two days and a weekend or something so they just need to look at different times and see when the cheapest sort of er weekend would be because if we can be flexible we can go obviously not over <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s birthday but we can go any time there's maybe three or four weekends we could choose from</u>
<u n="324" who="S0615">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> any time <pause dur="short"/> yeah see the price</u>

<u n="392" who="S0615">because you go in and get straight into the <pause dur="short"/> no no the kitchen goes a bit on because they've got a garage there so you go in and you go into the lounge and then you've got the just the dining table at the back and then you've got the wall wall stairs going up and then you have got the kitchen in there but so the kitchen is just well it's quite it's like a a little box room really you go in and there's a <unclear/></u>
<u n="393" who="S0525" trans="overlap">what and that there's a kitchen <pause dur="short"/> oh right <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> has it got a window?</u>

<u n="400" who="S0615">what was behind it then?</u>
<u n="401" who="S0525">I'm just trying to remember I don't think I don't think it had a window in it <pause dur="short"/> that was a really weird layout that was it was like a cupboard off the lounge they had turned into a kitchen</u>
<u n="402" who="S0615" trans="overlap">oh you let it get like that <pause dur="short"/> that was awful <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah well they'd almost like stuck another yeah it was <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="403" who="S0525">there's was waste they had to did they have the the downstairs toilet there in a little hallway?</u>
<u n="404" who="S0615">yeah you went in and it was a little hall and you go to the garage or you had the <unclear/> you went through another door you had a lounge but you had the stairs there but it was like</u>
<u n="405" who="S0525" trans="overlap">that's right <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was nice to have that <pause dur="short"/> that's right the stairs yeah</u>

<u n="407" who="S0525">that's right</u>
<u n="408" who="S0615">where would you put your TV? because there was no TV point there it was like over there your dining space was quite nice because you had a big the big french doors but yeah then you had the tiny little kitchen</u>
<u n="409" who="S0525" trans="overlap">and your dining table you couldn't could you <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes but if you added erm a table there you are struggling to get sofas and a <pause dur="short"/> well <trunc>it</trunc> it's like yours is now really but probably even smaller than that it was just wasted with that entrance hall</u>
<u n="410" who="S0615" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="411" who="S0525">it was nice to have that and then you felt you were going into something bigger but it was a bit pointless because there was nothing else there then was there?</u>
