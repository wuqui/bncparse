<u n="13" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0535">to the point where I actually left twenty-four years almost to the day that I went in and it felt as though I'd literally been there a week</u>
<u n="15" who="S0486">oh that's a wonderful experience isn't it?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0535">yeah</u>

<u n="23" who="S0486">yeah? well if you can tell me about some of the characters you work with that would be good</u>

<u n="26" who="S0535">fought with people like Jack Dempsey who was one of the world champions <pause dur="short"/> he was just a character <pause dur="short"/> but there were lots of people there were the biggest problem was the fact that I worked day shifts and there were people worked what they called twelve hour shifts and they literally were they used to do two days two nights so you used to see a whole range of different people all the time</u>
<u n="27" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="28" who="S0535">and I think that's probably what helped</u>
<u n="29" who="S0486">yeah</u>
