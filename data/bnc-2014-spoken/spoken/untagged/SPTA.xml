<u n="593" who="S0589" trans="overlap">they they have done for for erm Welsh TV</u>
<u n="594" who="S0588" trans="overlap">but why not have subtitles? cos it's really trendy at the moment to have subtitles</u>
<u n="595" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="596" who="S0589">but he doesn't speak Welsh</u>
<u n="597" who="S0588" trans="overlap">I mean I'd watch it</u>
