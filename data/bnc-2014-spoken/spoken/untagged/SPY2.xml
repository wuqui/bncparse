<u n="1" who="S0524">throw them out and</u>
<u n="2" who="S0486">there we go</u>
<u n="3" who="S0524">see how we go</u>
<u n="4" who="S0486">well thank you very much for talking to me today <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="5" who="S0524">my pleasure</u>
<u n="6" who="S0486">and what I'd like to ask you I'm looking at your form here is that you were a TV producer and I find that absolutely fascinating could you tell me more about the sort of programmes you produced?</u>
<u n="7" who="S0524">yes well er well <trunc>le</trunc>let's go back to the beginning since this is gonna take more than a few minutes we could fill it out erm my father was a teacher he was born and brought up in the south of England he was a teacher of biology at <anon type="place"/> school</u>
<u n="8" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="9" who="S0524">and his interests were apart from biology photography <pause dur="short"/> and so I was brought up in a family where my mother was a botanist where we would go for nature walks a lot and er dad would have his camera and bit by bit things brushed off on me first of all learning to see things that other people</u>
<u n="10" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0524">would walk past <trunc>th</trunc>they just wouldn't</u>
<u n="12" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0524" trans="overlap">notice erm seeing detail er one particular memory erm I have was father taking me for a walk in <anon type="place"/> woods which is not far from <anon type="place"/> and he stopped and he said er do you see that tree over there about fifty yards away? I said <trunc>w</trunc> but of course and he say well you see the trunk? and I said but of course I can see the trunk and he said do you see that moth that's on the bark of that trunk? and I said you've gotta be joking I mean from fifty yards how do you see a moth? anyway he said okay well <trunc>l</trunc>let's go closer and closer and closer and when you see the moth stop and point it out so we go closer and closer and closer and we get right up to the tree and I haven't seen anything and I said there isn't a moth and he said there is so I look and I look and I still see nothing and then he lifted his walking stick and he pointed right up to what I eventually noticed was a triangular shape that was only slightly different in colour to the background it was virtually a perfect camouflage match <pause dur="short"/> and I thought that was absolutely incredible how from fifty yards away could you see such a thing? and it was only later that I realised that as a biologist he'd studied this woodland for about five years in detail knew everything that existed there and where it was and what the habits where and so on <pause dur="short"/> and of course these camouflaged moths have to be invisible to their predators because they fly at night and in the daytime they've gotta go somewhere and birds come along and they find them so erm he didn't know of course it was there but he had a very good idea that it would be there cos he'd seen it there before and so on and so forth and it was experiences like that that helped me use my eyes and of course in that family er background erm my love of nature grew erm he taught me at school er biology at O level and at A level and because of that I had to work hard to make sure I <unclear/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0486" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yes</u>
<u n="15" who="S0524" trans="overlap">and er he couldn't be seen to be favouring me so he probably</u>
<u n="16" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0524">marked me down a bit I wouldn't be at all surprised</u>
<u n="18" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0524">so I I found that quite easy so of course I went to university and I did biology there because it was the easiest thing for me and I enjoyed it of course</u>
<u n="20" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0524">er so at the end of university I had to think okay what am I going to do? because until then I was just enjoying life and I decided because of er er of the influence my father had on on photography on my photography that I would go to erm <anon type="place"/> polytechnic to study a photography three year course which also had a specialism in filming now my father had experimented with filming er again when I was a teenager his his subject was badgers and his interest was to film them because people didn't know much about them the only problem was of course they only come out at night</u>
<u n="22" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="23" who="S0524">when it's dark</u>
<u n="24" who="S0486">uhu</u>
<u n="25" who="S0524">they have amazing sense of hearing and of smell so you've got lots of problems to solve anyway he solved all those and er resulting film appeared on the BBC in Bristol er introduced by Peter Scott and er he used to do a number of radio programmes as well er Nature Parliament and Country Questions answering questions</u>
<u n="26" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="27" who="S0524" trans="overlap">that the public had sent in and so on and so forth and I would go up with him sometimes just to sort of see what it was all about</u>
<u n="28" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0524" trans="overlap"><unclear/> so I was I was interested in that and anyway having gone through the university and having gone through this erm er course in London at <anon type="place"/> polytechnic er I was faced with the obvious question of okay now are you going to be a perpetual student or are you actually going to get a job? and I was looking at adverts and I saw erm an advert from the BBC <pause dur="short"/> and I thought oh this looks interesting this was erm to come in as a production assistant to work on educational programmes for schools erm based in London and I thought oh <unclear/> this would be interesting erm only of course I know nothing about the electronic studio side of production</u>
<u n="30" who="S0486">uhu</u>
<u n="31" who="S0524">only having had an introduction into film work <pause dur="short"/> anyway I went for the interview <pause dur="short"/> and erm before I heard the result the following week because these adverts appeared I think it was in the Telegraph erm every Wednesday or something so I I I was looking and then I saw this advert for the BBC to work as a production assistant in Bristol to work on natural history programmes <pause dur="short"/> and I thought well I know much more about this <vocal desc="laugh"/> than I do about the</u>
<u n="32" who="S0486" trans="overlap">how amazing</u>
<u n="33" who="S0524">the London thing</u>
<u n="34" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0524" trans="overlap">so I'll go in for this this'll</u>
<u n="36" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0524" trans="overlap">be interesting so I was interviewed for that and er to my great surprise erm I got a letter from er the school television department in London to say erm er we we can't offer you this job of production assistant level er because of your lack of experience but we would like to offer you a job as a researcher again with school programmes</u>
<u n="38" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0524">er on a variety of subjects and so on and a few days later I got a a letter from the BBC in Bristol er that said er you know er thank you for coming for interview etcetera etcetera etcetera erm er we er we don't think er you have enough experience to come in at production assistant level but we would like to offer you the job as a researcher on natural history programmes in Bristol</u>
<u n="40" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yes <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0524">and I remember that the salary was er twelve hundred and twelve hundred and seventy-five pounds or something and er in London it was thirteen hundred and something because of the London weighting etcetera etcetera but basically</u>
<u n="42" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0524" trans="overlap">it was the same so I <trunc>h</trunc> I had the privilege of this this problem</u>
<u n="44" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0524" trans="overlap">if you like and I decided that well the Bristol one I know much more about but really what would be really exciting for me would be to learn about studio production <pause dur="short"/> so I accepted the London job</u>
<u n="46" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="47" who="S0524">and so I went to the BBC in London and for thirteen years I learnt the craft of erm television production directing producing erm going from researcher to production assistant to assistant producer to producer to executive producer and and working with erm fast turnover programmes short programmes with low budgets</u>
<u n="48" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="49" who="S0524">you get a huge amount of experience in a relatively short period of time and I was er very lucky to have done er studio productions erm recorded as live on a whole variety of subjects</u>
<u n="50" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0524">which included biology erm but all kinds of other things er general studies which in those days was erm anything thought to be important that wasn't on a syllabus and so that was you know</u>
<u n="52" who="S0486">uhu</u>
<u n="53" who="S0524" trans="overlap">sex and drugs and religion and religion and politics</u>
<u n="54" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0524">and and all kinds of wonderful things</u>
<u n="56" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="57" who="S0524">but eventually I had to think well this is all very good all very fascinating but isn't it perhaps time I sort of specialised in something? erm and the one thing that frustrated me with erm school television was the size of the budget and the length of the programme erm I wanted to do something that was a bit more ambitious and erm a bigger budget like fifty minute programmes and I thought well really I'm now ready to do some natural history programmes but bringing to an outer history unit in Bristol some wider experience than</u>
<u n="58" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="59" who="S0524">most of the people there had so that probably I would have a chance when when a a job came up <pause dur="short"/> and a job did come up and that was to er produce programmes on a series called The Living Planet where they were record <trunc>w</trunc> er were looking for people er to join a team for a three year project multimillion pounds with David Attenborough</u>
<u n="60" who="S0486">oh right</u>
<u n="61" who="S0524">erm and I thought no I won't get that er but at the same time er there was a job for a producer on erm a long running series called The World About Us and I thought oh that's more like it er so I went in for that and erm had a long interview and and er er they said could you <trunc>sh</trunc> could you wait outside and so on cos I think I must have been the last candidate and they wanted to talk and they hauled me in and they said erm well we're very impressed with the stuff that you've done etcetera etcetera but you haven't done a fifty minute programme before er you haven't er you know written a fifty minute script erm mm we we don't really think erm er we should give you this particular post and then they said but as you may be aware er we're recruiting for the new Attenborough big Attenborough project erm would you like it?</u>
<u n="62" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh that was a bit of a stunner</u>
<u n="63" who="S0524">and that was extraordinary the reasoning was erm because David Attenborough was there and there was an executive producer <unclear>in charge</unclear> with huge experience erm the key structure of the long programmes was heavily influenced by David Attenborough himself <pause dur="short"/> er this was in the days when these projects were very much his projects</u>
<u n="64" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="65" who="S0524">whereas now he narrates other people's work and all <trunc>oth</trunc> everyone thinks they're his as well <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="66" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0524" trans="overlap">erm and therefore the element they were in doubt about as far as my experience was concerned was basically covered by the experience of the existing team and er other aspects they thought I could do er so they offered it to me and I took it <pause dur="short"/> erm so I spent the next three years working on that which was fantastic and then what did I do? er then I was editor of a series called Nature which was live television er with with filmed recorded inserts er stories in in that er then I was editor of er The Natural World very ironic because I wasn't accepted to be a producer erm on erm that series which er the previous name but they changed it to The Natural World but then I was made editor of the entire series <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0486">oh my goodness</u>
<u n="69" who="S0524">erm but in a funny way er then you're you're still not you're still not writing er fifty minute scripts</u>
<u n="70" who="S0486" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="71" who="S0524" trans="overlap">you're looking after er mm mm a rather different kind of project <pause dur="short"/> and then finally the job of head of the natural history unit came up and erm I was encouraged to go in for it and I looked at the candidates and I thought god I don't want him to take over and I don't want him to take over <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="72" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="73" who="S0524"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="74" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0524">er er and I thought mm well I'm not sure I really want it but I don't want to be ruled by them and then maybe if I don't go in for it one day I'm gonna curse myself you really should have done that because you only get</u>
<u n="76" who="S0486" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0524" trans="overlap">this opportunity once er so I went in for it and after an awful lot of humming and harring er by other people in charge they decided to give it to me erm so I did that and then <pause dur="short"/> I think twenty-five years to the day after joining the BBC which happened to be on my birthday erm I thought well that's the time to leave because I'd sort of done it</u>
<u n="78" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="79" who="S0524">and I didn't want to step down from being head and then making programmes again it's also a difficult issue for the new head and and</u>
<u n="80" who="S0486" trans="overlap">it's it's</u>
<u n="81" who="S0524" trans="overlap">so on</u>
<u n="82" who="S0486" trans="overlap">true yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0524">er <trunc>th</trunc> just get out</u>
<u n="84" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0524">er enjoy it so I got out and then I joined a er a commercial television er production company in London I wanted to get back to London er called <anon type="place"/> erm the boss said to me er we want to set up a natural history wing from scratch erm we think you could do it would you like to do it? and I said yes because this was totally different</u>
<u n="86" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0524">but involved the same people I'd met all over the world doing natural history and so on erm but it was it was commercial it was a very different thing I was offered a three year er fixed contract meaning at the end it would end whatever happened erm and my job was to set this up to buy up film from all over the world that either hadn't been used or was getting tired and needed to be reinvigorated turned into new programmes and so on and so forth and to commission new stuff and er I did that and they seemed to be very pleased and at the end of it erm er I knew that was it because I'd proved to myself that financially it made no sense to originate completely new types of programmes erm which would cost a lot of money er where there's a risk factor as there always is in natural history filming you know things can go wrong and so on and so forth</u>
<u n="88" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0524">and if you work for a commercial company you've got to deliver and I proved that you could get highly saleable productions from existing sources and and catalogues and library catalogues and so on and so forth build up an immense library for very little money in comparison to doing the new stuff erm I knew that they knew that they preferred that so I went</u>
<u n="90" who="S0486">uhu</u>
<u n="91" who="S0524">that was it and then after a number of years of of doing consultant work with other broadcasters in places like New Zealand and the States I thought well I've sort of done it erm I'm only er going round and round and round and the programmes are getting ever less interesting to me erm why not get back to my original interest which was photography? erm I was able to retire so I did and I'm still doing it still doing the photography</u>
<u n="92" who="S0486">oh right</u>
<u n="93" who="S0524">and the photography <pause dur="short"/> is sort of abstract pictures taken in nature where you've got interesting shapes or forms sculptural shapes or forms patterns and so on erm but within these abstracts you can see erm faces or you can see shapes that indicate that it's a sort of animal or something of that sort</u>
<u n="94" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="95" who="S0524">so each each one has that sort of theme to it and the idea is er to have exhibitions of of these pictures and get particularly children er preferably families but with children in them to come and for the kids to see these things and to work out what they're looking at cos they have so much imagination it's absolutely amazing and therefore to get them interested in going out into into the wilds going out into nature I mean it could be a park it could be garden it doesn't have to be an exotic place and see if they can <trunc>f</trunc> spot images of faces or or of creatures in in in rocks in wooden shapes in erm forms of leaves and so on and so forth so it encourages them to go out and and see nature in a slightly different way</u>
<u n="96" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0524">and appreciate nature and that's where it goes sort of full circle back from where I started and my parents took me out and I got interested in nature and this is sort of my way of encouraging youngsters to do</u>
<u n="98" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="99" who="S0524">the same sort of thing</u>
<u n="100" who="S0486">oh right</u>
<u n="101" who="S0524">and erm fortunately er the <anon type="place"/> museum here erm got very interested in the idea of an exhibition which er I would hold jointly with my brother er or or one of my brothers the <anon type="place"/> brother who is an artist and sculptor and I'm a photographer so</u>
<u n="102" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="103" who="S0524">we've got and he was of course inspired by nature in his way and he's expressed it in his way and we're combining this into an exhibition called <anon type="place"/> er which is going to come on in a year's time</u>
<u n="104" who="S0486">oh right that's exiting</u>
<u n="105" who="S0524">so we we've gone we've gone the full circle</u>
<u n="106" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="107" who="S0524">in <anon type="place"/> cos the influences the <anon type="place"/> on me although I was born in <anon type="place"/> at the age of two I was brought to <anon type="place"/> and er my parents rented a thatched cottage in er <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="108" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="109" who="S0524">which is still there</u>
<u n="110" who="S0486">oh yes?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0524">erm and then moved into <anon type="place"/> and he was working of course at the school erm and then when I left school I went to <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/> university and then to the er er photographic course in <anon type="place"/> and then of course I stayed in <anon type="place"/> erm then went to <anon type="place"/> and went back to <anon type="place"/> erm my wife died er eight years ago suddenly and I had to reassess things and after a while I I got fed up with London I wanted to move away from <trunc>b</trunc> the the flat we had there and so on <vocal desc="cough"/> and thought well where do I wanna go? and I thought well I really ought to go somewhere where I've got connection so that was either but <anon type="place"/> where I left at the age of two that wasn't really a memory erm the university of <anon type="place"/> is not the warmest place on earth but it's a lovely place</u>
<u n="112" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0524">although it's changed completely as a result of the oil which happened after I left there erm <anon type="place"/> er which I wanted to get away from at least for a while or <anon type="place"/> and my my brother had moved from his work at <anon type="place"/> and so on he was based in <anon type="place"/> he came to <anon type="place"/> and he seemed to like it so I thought well and then I found this house and I say oh</u>
<u n="114" who="S0486"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="115" who="S0524">I like this <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="116" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yes fantastic</u>
<u n="117" who="S0524" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0486" trans="overlap">position</u>
<u n="119" who="S0524">it is a fantastic position and I was lucky having done what I've done that I</u>
<u n="120" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0524" trans="overlap">had a property in <anon type="place"/> so it's selling a property in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="122" who="S0486">oh yes</u>
<u n="123" who="S0524">erm you've got enough money to buy it</u>
<u n="124" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="125" who="S0524">so erm it needed a lot of work er cos it was owned for at least a decade by erm a couple who were both doctors with teenage children and having teenage children and being very busy people they didn't do an awful lot to keep this place going and it needed</u>
<u n="126" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="127" who="S0524">needed help</u>
<u n="128" who="S0486">yes</u>

<u n="830" who="S0524">erm <pause dur="short"/> and without any explanation at all all you can sort of think of is well the sculpture's quite nice cos it it it's a shape and it looks a bit like a bird or or whatever</u>
<u n="831" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="832" who="S0524" trans="overlap">but that's about as far as you go you won't think it's connected to the one at the back because why would you? and so on and so on and so on</u>
<u n="833" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="834" who="S0524">erm but in fact it it's it's meant to be a piece erm about our ancestry</u>
<u n="835" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="836" who="S0524">because my <pause dur="short"/> mother's father's <pause dur="short"/> parents or maybe they were grandparents er were moved out during the clearances in in</u>
<u n="837" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="838" who="S0524" trans="overlap">in western Scotland and that was a a a a fairly tragic time and my brother went up to see if he could track down the the the cottage and eventually he could and he tracked down the graveyard and he found a tombstone and so on and so forth and he wanted to do something that related to that sort of erm er brutal time of their erm being turfed off their land and so on and so forth so when he went and he'd found the the area he saw that the land now was covered in gorse and he thought mm gorse and er knowing a bit about gorse well they've got these</u>
<u n="839" who="S0486" trans="overlap">oh I see it now</u>
<u n="840" who="S0524" trans="overlap">dried pods</u>
<u n="841" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="842" who="S0524">which twist when they dry out</u>
<u n="843" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="844" who="S0524">and then they explode</u>
<u n="845" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="846" who="S0524">they are distributed</u>
<u n="847" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="848" who="S0524" trans="overlap">they they're moved and he thought well we could do something about gorse and erm he also went to a museum of agricultural implements which showed the kind of ploughs that were used in those days</u>
<u n="849" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="850" who="S0524" trans="overlap">which similar to <trunc>el</trunc>elsewhere as well and nothing er very specific to to Scotland erm but er he he being by er training an engineer er he was interested in erm the front of the plough with the sock and the coulter</u>
<u n="851" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="852" who="S0524">erm where this represents erm I can't remember which way round it is now if that's the sock it's what turns the soil</u>
<u n="853" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="854" who="S0524" trans="overlap">soil over and this is the coulter</u>
<u n="855" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="856" who="S0524" trans="overlap">or it's the other way round that does the</u>
<u n="857" who="S0486" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="858" who="S0524" trans="overlap">actual ploughing</u>
<u n="859" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="860" who="S0524" trans="overlap">so the two pieces dig and turn erm and then looking at the erm at the the gorse pod itself when it twists it's a bit like that that that's the opened</u>
<u n="861" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="862" who="S0524">the opened pod and the the seeds come up erm and this of course is gorse he took a photograph</u>
<u n="863" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="864" who="S0524" trans="overlap">and it's quite accurate but of course he's toned down the yellow</u>
<u n="865" who="S0486">yes</u>
<u n="866" who="S0524">erm here is a representation of the the the what was left of the cottage which is just a pile of stones</u>
<u n="867" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="868" who="S0524">er this indicates age because on the tombstones the <trunc>th</trunc>this is the lichen that</u>
