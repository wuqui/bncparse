<u n="525" who="S0530" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="526" who="S0529" trans="overlap"><unclear/> here cos I have no idea</u>
<u n="527" who="S0530" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="528" who="S0529">any more than you do I'm just kind of a negative person anyway <unclear/> life at the moment it feels like a very nasty situation</u>

<u n="530" who="S0529">and it does feel like an imminent threat because of what happened in Paris <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="531" who="S0530">I mean I guess you could look at it in the way that like you know those bomb attacks in London?</u>
<u n="532" who="S0529">mm</u>
<u n="533" who="S0530">here we are how many years later? and the world's not collapsed even though things are pretty bad like we've not</u>

<u n="542" who="S0529" trans="overlap">I mean England's too strong and we have too many allies and yeah it I don't think it would come to that</u>
<u n="543" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="544" who="S0529">and also like they like spontaneity and if they attack London straight after when we're expecting them to attack us which we are now kind of like there will be a threat level thing and everyone will be aware that like</u>
<u n="545" who="S0530">that's the thing</u>
<u n="546" who="S0529" trans="overlap">there's a high threat</u>
