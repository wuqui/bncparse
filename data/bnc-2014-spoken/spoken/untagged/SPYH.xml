<u n="640" who="S0580">oh okay</u>
<u n="641" who="S0454">that's a bit of a problem</u>
<u n="642" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="643" who="S0454"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> yes I'm involved in this experiment erm for a new form of CBT treatment they're trialling</u>
<u n="644" who="S0580" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="645" who="S0454">some programme on a phone they put lent me a smartphone for the weekend <pause dur="short"/> we have to <trunc>pro</trunc> for the week actually have to programme in five or they programmed in five activities you want to enjoy over the week it can be anything you want but it has to be alone and it's not allowed to be watching TV <pause dur="short"/> or sleeping</u>
<u n="646" who="S0580" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="647" who="S0454">or getting drunk <pause dur="short"/> anything other than that is fine so they make you list them they did that yesterday with me I then put in a time that you want to do it and then it beeps at you and tells you when to go and do it <pause dur="short"/> and five like fifteen minutes before tells you go and get your boots or whatever <pause dur="short"/> er and then it asks you how happy you are and then afterwards you go and do the activity</u>
<u n="648" who="S0580" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="649" who="S0454">and then it asks you again how you feel cos they're saying <pause dur="short"/> er you're anticipation of events <pause dur="short"/> is a large part of enjoying them <pause dur="short"/> so the more specific you are about scheduling events you're going to enjoy by yourself and this is key <pause dur="short"/> then the more likely you are to be happy <pause dur="short"/> overall <pause dur="short"/> and most of us are very bad at that we schedule appointments like the doctor we schedule going to work schedule meeting other people like meeting you today we had a time we're very bad at scheduling time by ourselves where we're going to do something we enjoy</u>
<u n="650" who="S0580">that's probably true <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="651" who="S0454" trans="overlap">and <trunc>pe</trunc><trunc>pe</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> well it's probably true for everybody and for people who are depressed that is a key part of it <pause dur="short"/> the more you anticipate it the</u>
<u n="652" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="653" who="S0454">just the the very anticipation is part of it so it's not just</u>
<u n="654" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="655" who="S0454">alright I think I'll go and take a walk now <pause dur="short"/> it's actually the build-up <pause dur="short"/> it's quite interesting</u>
<u n="656" who="S0580"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="657" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="658" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="659" who="S0579" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="660" who="S0454">and then they're looking at erm <pause dur="short"/> how we perceive the event while we're doing it so if you're a happy person if you're reasonably satisfied then you just go and do the event and you'll probably enjoy it that's called savouring <pause dur="short"/> but for someone who's depressed they will have what they call dampening effects which means they'll go and they'll do their walk but the whole time they'll feel guilty that they should be doing something else or they'll think this is too good to last so they'll have all these negative thoughts while they're doing it which of course by default means you</u>
<u n="661" who="S0580" trans="overlap"><unclear/> experience <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="662" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes you've ruined the whole experience <pause dur="short"/> anyway <pause dur="short"/> so the yeah part of prompt is it tells you you're meant to be feeling <pause dur="short"/> erm not feeling happy but they say to try and avoid these negative thoughts just stop it <trunc>s</trunc> CBT <pause dur="short"/> so they do that before you do the activity to remind you but then during it they don't do it cos that might be annoying <pause dur="short"/> sort of beeping at you the whole time <pause dur="short"/> yes it's quite interesting so I've got these five</u>
<u n="663" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="664" who="S0454">activities in a week but they say if they did it</u>
<u n="665" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah why not? <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="666" who="S0454">on an actual programme it would take place over six weeks for example and then you'd see a doctor and you would look at before and after <pause dur="short"/> they're quite interesting</u>
<u n="667" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="668" who="S0579">yeah</u>

<u n="765" who="S0580">it's a wonderful invention</u>

<u n="807" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="808" who="S0454">hm <pause dur="short"/> I can't wait</u>

<u n="813" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="814" who="S0454">I can't wait for those driverless cars to be legalised here those Google cars</u>
<u n="815" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh that sounds rather nice <unclear/></u>
<u n="816" who="S0580">yes I've been reading about those</u>
<u n="817" who="S0454" trans="overlap">amazing <pause dur="short"/> oh I can't wait for them <pause dur="short"/> they've been trialling them in California for years now haven't they?</u>
<u n="818" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="819" who="S0454">gone on and on but the problem in the UK is the legislation apparently like if you hit someone in a driverless car who is legally responsible? <pause dur="short"/> the non driver who's sitting in the car? <pause dur="short"/> or the company who made the car?</u>
<u n="820" who="S0580">right</u>
<u n="821" who="S0454">so until they sort that out it won't be legalised</u>
<u n="822" who="S0579">yeah when you say it's a <pause dur="short"/> you say someone sitting in the car but not a driver is that what happens?</u>
<u n="823" who="S0454">yes <pause dur="short"/> so at the moment they they've got cars <pause dur="short"/> where you don't need a driver but in California by law you have to have <pause dur="short"/> a driver anyway</u>
<u n="824" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="825" who="S0454">sitting in the driver's seat ready to take over</u>
<u n="826" who="S0580" trans="overlap">but not doing anything <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="827" who="S0454">but not doing anything which defeats the point of the object yeah</u>
<u n="828" who="S0580" trans="overlap">driverless car</u>
<u n="829" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="830" who="S0580"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="831" who="S0454">stupid</u>
<u n="832" who="S0579" trans="overlap">well we haven't got any of those in the UK have we?</u>
<u n="833" who="S0454" trans="overlap">no because of the legal situation</u>
<u n="834" who="S0579"><unclear/></u>
<u n="835" who="S0454" trans="overlap">they can't decide who's legally responsible</u>
<u n="836" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="837" who="S0454">if the car hit something</u>
<u n="838" who="S0579">oh yeah</u>
<u n="839" who="S0580">so <pause dur="short"/> who's legally responsible in the States then?</u>
<u n="840" who="S0454">don't know</u>
<u n="841" who="S0580" trans="overlap">how do they work it?</u>
<u n="842" who="S0454">don't know how they <trunc>wor</trunc> I imagine Google will pick up the bill cos they're it's still in trials <pause dur="short"/> cos they haven't</u>
<u n="843" who="S0580" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="844" who="S0454">released these to the public yet</u>
<u n="845" who="S0580" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="846" who="S0454">they're still in these endless trials</u>
<u n="847" who="S0579">oh yes</u>
<u n="848" who="S0454">but they seem a bit more advanced there <pause dur="short"/> but you just think oh</u>
<u n="849" who="S0580" trans="overlap">they're coming dad</u>
<u n="850" who="S0454">they're coming <pause dur="short"/> I can't wait</u>
<u n="851" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah they're coming</u>
<u n="852" who="S0454">but it will cost industries money because if no one crashes insurance goes out the window</u>
<u n="853" who="S0580">no of course it does <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="854" who="S0454">so someone is gonna lose a lot of money and</u>
<u n="855" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="856" who="S0454">mechanics will lose money <pause dur="short"/> people make money off dents don't they? <pause dur="short"/> scratches</u>
<u n="857" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="858" who="S0579">how do you have a driverless car then?</u>
<u n="859" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so then what they were doing <pause dur="short"/> because it somehow I don't know how it detects how far away the car in front is <pause dur="short"/> and then if that breaks it knows to break <pause dur="short"/> so they never hit <pause dur="short"/> so actually in the <pause dur="short"/> they've been testing it about three years <pause dur="short"/> it's never crashed into anything but other things have crashed into it</u>
<u n="860" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="861" who="S0454">so it can't stop anyone going into the back of you for example so there will still be accidents</u>
<u n="862" who="S0579">but then isn't another driver in the seat?</u>
<u n="863" who="S0454">yes at the moment</u>
<u n="864" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="865" who="S0454">legally there has to be someone sitting there but they're not driving</u>
<u n="866" who="S0579">oh <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="867" who="S0454" trans="overlap">the car drives itself but if they needed to they could take over <pause dur="short"/> a bit like er aeroplanes</u>
<u n="868" who="S0579">oh I see yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="869" who="S0454" trans="overlap">they're all on autopilot aren't they?</u>
<u n="870" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="871" who="S0454">but they still have to have a pilot there</u>
<u n="872" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/> a pilot there yeah in case</u>
<u n="873" who="S0454">just in case</u>
<u n="874" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="875" who="S0454">yes <pause dur="short"/> but no one actually flies planes or drives trains that's the funny thing planes and trains everybody</u>
<u n="876" who="S0580" trans="overlap">they drive themselves</u>
<u n="877" who="S0454">accepts <pause dur="short"/> that you have the driver there but they don't do anything <pause dur="short"/> nobody's questioned that</u>
<u n="878" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="879" who="S0454">even though they've got five hundred people in a plane nobody questions the fact that it's on autopilot for <pause dur="short"/> the vast majority of that flight but cars we're all like oh oh well this is something new</u>
<u n="880" who="S0580" trans="overlap">they're paranoid about that <unclear>aren't they?</unclear></u>
<u n="881" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh yes <pause dur="short"/> oh we can't have that <pause dur="short"/> and even in London those erm with which one? the the Docklands light railway that's driverless isn't it?</u>
<u n="882" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="883" who="S0454">the Dubai metro's driverless</u>
<u n="884" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="885" who="S0454">and we're all like fine about that <pause dur="short"/> in fact the Dubai one doesn't even have a driver it is actually driverless there's no one there</u>
<u n="886" who="S0579">yes</u>
<u n="887" who="S0454" trans="overlap">we're all fine <pause dur="short"/> and they've never crashed</u>
<u n="888" who="S0579">have to get a driverless car</u>
<u n="889" who="S0580" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="890" who="S0579">that'll be nice won't it? sit in the back and</u>
<u n="891" who="S0454" trans="overlap">well I'd love it</u>
<u n="892" who="S0579">read the papers and <unclear/></u>
<u n="893" who="S0454" trans="overlap">I think it'd be excellent</u>
<u n="894" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="895" who="S0580">I can just see a driverless car taking that route though into <anon type="place"/> along <anon type="place"/> where it's going <unclear>in down</unclear></u>
<u n="896" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> goes in and out</u>
<u n="897" who="S0454">it'd be quite scary because</u>
<u n="898" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="899" who="S0454">they'd be a lot closer <pause dur="short"/> because they'd be <pause dur="short"/> cos it would know exactly how many millimetres to leave so initially it'll be terrifying</u>
<u n="900" who="S0580" trans="overlap">quite frightening yeah</u>
<u n="901" who="S0454">because it'll be really really close</u>
<u n="902" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="903" who="S0454">and you'll think it's going to hit cos they can actually drive about fifty centimetres apart because they know whereas we have to leave you know a couple of car lengths</u>
<u n="904" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="905" who="S0454">cos we're too slow aren't we? we'd have to be sure we could stop er</u>
<u n="906" who="S0579" trans="overlap">what happens on crossroads?</u>
<u n="907" who="S0454">yes <pause dur="short"/> well apparently they've programmed it so it's very very cautious</u>
<u n="908" who="S0579">I see yeah</u>
<u n="909" who="S0454">but they found out that actually causes other people to go into the back</u>
<u n="910" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="911" who="S0454">because say the light is amber</u>
<u n="912" who="S0579">oh yes</u>
<u n="913" who="S0454">most drivers will speed up to get through the light but this car's been programmed to stop so then people go into the back of it cos they're expecting the car in front to go through the lights so actually</u>
<u n="914" who="S0579" trans="overlap">mm <unclear/></u>
<u n="915" who="S0454">yes they've had to programme it to be more dangerous now to take more risks</u>
<u n="916" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="917" who="S0454">not to crash but if it's amber for example</u>
<u n="918" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="919" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="920" who="S0454">it should be programmed to speed up cos that's what other drivers do</u>
<u n="921" who="S0579">have you ever seen a car on the road then like that?</u>
<u n="922" who="S0454">no I want to I'm I'm excited by it</u>

<u n="1016" who="S0454">they have boxes <pause dur="short"/> in each plane I forget what they're called and actually it's no longer the pilots that do it because there were too many errors <pause dur="short"/> if they had to decide to go up or down to avoid the plane what if they both decided to go up?</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0580">yes</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0454">like that doesn't work so now</u>

<u n="1414" who="S0454">I'm just amazed</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0454">I can even get my car cleaned inside and out while I'm doing my shop <pause dur="short"/> just amazing <pause dur="short"/> and then</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0454">they've got this new thing scan as you go have you seen that?</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0580">yeah <unclear/> what's that word?</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0454">amazing <pause dur="short"/> oh I've just discovered this so you scan your club card when you go in and it gives you this machine which is what the checkout woman has</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0454">so you take your bags in cos you know you have to take your own bags now so you scan as you go and you put it in your shopping bag and then when you it's the end instead of having to take it out and put it all on the conveyor belt one by one</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0580" trans="overlap">one by one</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0454">you don't you just pay</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0579">well what's to stop you putting in something and not scanning it?</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0454">nothing er except they do random checks but I've been I they checked the first one to check you did it right but they don't check everything they just check like three items to check you didn't steal those three items and after that it's random that you don't know when it's going to be so it's supposed to be</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0580" trans="overlap">so you could get stopped</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0454">you could get stopped <pause dur="short"/> randomly and they do do random checks apparently but it's not every time so yes theoretically they could</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0580" trans="overlap">oh so that's how it works I've always wondered</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0454" trans="overlap"><unclear/> what's the point? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1432" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0454">but I do it today <pause dur="short"/> and I think yeah the first time I was slow but it is quicker overall cos that is quite a big slowing you up isn't it? one by one having to take everything out</u>
<u n="1434" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah when you feed everything onto the yeah</u>
<u n="1435" who="S0454">so you do everything twice you put it all in one by one then you take it all out one by one and then you have to re-pack it one by one</u>
<u n="1436" who="S0580" trans="overlap">and then <unclear>load</unclear> it again</u>
<u n="1437" who="S0454">so it's triple the work</u>
<u n="1438" who="S0579">ah</u>
<u n="1439" who="S0454">so you just do it once</u>
<u n="1440" who="S0580">yeah that's logical but I've <trunc>oft</trunc> I've often thought</u>
<u n="1441" who="S0454">what</u>
<u n="1442" who="S0580" trans="overlap">what's to stop people loading up and not scanning it and then escaping with free stuff</u>
<u n="1443" who="S0454">well I think they must do it</u>
<u n="1444" who="S0579" trans="overlap">must try and run after you <vocal desc="laugh"/> tell me how you did it <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1445" who="S0454">but you wonder</u>
<u n="1446" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="1447" who="S0454">how if they've calculated that in the cost of someone's wage</u>
<u n="1448" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="1449" who="S0579">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes <unclear/></u>
<u n="1450" who="S0454" trans="overlap">versus the odd person who steals</u>
<u n="1451" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1452" who="S0454">cos you probably won't steal the whole trolley load <pause dur="short"/> cos you look at you'd be suspicious it would be one thing probably or two things</u>
<u n="1453" who="S0580" trans="overlap">oh no <unclear/> yes</u>
<u n="1454" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1455" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="1456" who="S0454">but you think I wonder if they'd calculated that in</u>
<u n="1457" who="S0580">they must do because there's gonna be an element of people sneaking in one or two things and not paying</u>
<u n="1458" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1459" who="S0580">I don't know there has to be</u>
<u n="1460" who="S0454">but they must think they save money overall</u>
<u n="1461" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="1462" who="S0454">which is amazing isn't it? <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="1463" who="S0580" trans="overlap">did you hear that dad? about scan as you go?</u>
<u n="1464" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="1465" who="S0580">you can go into the supermarket and get a little handheld device and as you shop you put it you scan it the item and then you put it straight into your shopping bag</u>
<u n="1466" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="1467" who="S0580">so that when you come to the till you don't have to be doing this with all your goods because you've already recorded it on this device and it's already in your shopping bag</u>
<u n="1468" who="S0579">what about if you've decided not to put one on there?</u>
<u n="1469" who="S0580">well this is what we just said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="1470" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>oh</unclear></u>
<u n="1471" who="S0454">yeah</u>
<u n="1472" who="S0579"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1473" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes well we think it must happen</u>
<u n="1474" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1475" who="S0454">sometimes they check but not every time</u>
<u n="1476" who="S0579">oh I see must be <unclear/></u>
<u n="1477" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1478" who="S0580" trans="overlap">I mean I wouldn't dare risk it <vocal desc="laugh"/> in case you know you be the one that was stopped or whatever</u>
<u n="1479" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1480" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but then you'd just say that's one item you just say <pause dur="short"/> oh I'm sorry I must have done it wrong</u>
<u n="1481" who="S0580" trans="overlap">oh I'm sorry I must have forgotten</u>
<u n="1482" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no <unclear/></u>
<u n="1483" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes oh it must have broken</u>
<u n="1484" who="S0579">ah yes</u>
<u n="1485" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes so I'm sure you get away with that I mean you'd be suspicious if you had lots of things <vocal desc="laugh"/> wouldn't it? but</u>
<u n="1486" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1487" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1488" who="S0454">if it was one thing you'd probably get away with it</u>
<u n="1489" who="S0580">so when you come to pay you just show this device to a terminal thing do you?</u>
<u n="1490" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes you <trunc>s</trunc> you show the device you scan it and then it just runs through everything so you'd check if there was an error I suppose</u>
<u n="1491" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="1492" who="S0454">and then if you bought alcohol then it beeps for the woman to come anyway to check the</u>
<u n="1493" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1494" who="S0454">you know over eighteen but if you've not you've not got a restricted item it just tells you to pay and that's the end <pause dur="short"/> you don't even have to give it your club card cos you already did that at the beginning</u>
<u n="1495" who="S0580">I'm going to try that <unclear/> I'm going to <unclear/></u>
<u n="1496" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah that fun it was really fun</u>
<u n="1497" who="S0580">I I've put off finding out how it works I thought oh <pause dur="short"/> forget that</u>
<u n="1498" who="S0454">yes that was very exciting development for me <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="1499" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh absolutely I see yes</u>
<u n="1500" who="S0454">there'll be supermarkets with no people soon <pause dur="short"/> no staff</u>
<u n="1501" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="1502" who="S0454">that'll be the next thing all those checkouts'll disappear and just be these terminals <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's quite exciting and the good thing is if you're on a low budget or if you just like budgeting you know what you're spending</u>
<u n="1503" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1504" who="S0579">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1505" who="S0454" trans="overlap">which is a huge help and it's quite easy to take things off <pause dur="short"/> cos that you know normally you're kind of guessing aren't you?</u>
<u n="1506" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yes you are</u>
<u n="1507" who="S0454">sort of adding it up in your head but you never quite know because you don't know really what the fruit weighs and <pause dur="short"/> all of that so you've done all of that by the time you get to the end <unclear/></u>
<u n="1508" who="S0580" trans="overlap">so supposing you put something in your basket and then and you've scanned it and you think no I don't actually want this you can take it out and</u>

<u n="1515" who="S0454">that's it <pause dur="short"/> the only thing you can't do which they can do at the till is if you had six of something</u>

<u n="1522" who="S0580" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1523" who="S0454">but I like the fact it adds it up</u>
