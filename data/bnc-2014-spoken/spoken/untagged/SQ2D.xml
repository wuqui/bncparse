<u n="100" who="S0024">mm hm <pause dur="short"/> she's got to be careful because she all of this stuff she had today she'd have never walked into NHS and got basically <pause dur="short"/> you have to go on a waiting list and everything like that</u>
<u n="101" who="S0144">wait about three years <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0024">they haven't got the staff to be able to do it <pause dur="short"/> I mean what she had today is the private healthcare option</u>

<u n="106" who="S0012">they said her employers are supposed to pay <pause dur="short"/> that's what the doctor at the</u>

<u n="108" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="109" who="S0024">and <trunc>e</trunc> they they tested for everything didn't they?</u>

<u n="111" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Right</u>

<u n="114" who="S0012">and she hadn't got a sore throat <pause dur="short"/> don't they call that endoscopy? <trunc>Endos</trunc> something like that</u>
<u n="115" who="S0024" trans="overlap">it is amazing some of those healthcare options but it's the same here if you have like the private healthcare?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I don't know</u>
<u n="117" who="S0024">but the NHS just can't afford to do that kind of thing test people for everything can they? Do you remember <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>? He used to have his like when when they found out he went to the <trunc>NH</trunc> like they tried to test him but they didn't do enough tests</u>
<u n="118" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="119" who="S0024">to be able to so he went and paid for private healthcare and stayed there the whole day doing and they did every single test under the sun on him and then and then that's when he found out he had Crohn's disease and then from then onwards he could be treated by the NHS but it's all of the tests cos they cost a fortune</u>
<u n="120" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0144">really?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0024">they can't do all of those tests for everybody</u>
<u n="123" who="S0144">that's like my mum isn't it?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0144">she's been trying to find out what was wrong with her for about eight years now</u>
<u n="126" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was wondering whether she</u>
<u n="128" who="S0144" trans="overlap">and they still don't know</u>
<u n="129" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was wondering whether</u>
<u n="130" who="S0144">that's because they're always playing golf <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="131" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0024">no <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="133" who="S0012">no <pause dur="short"/> the trouble is you see <trunc>h</trunc> how how our system is <pause dur="short"/> every time you you get something wrong you see a different person</u>
<u n="134" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly that's the problem</u>
<u n="135" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah that's what the problem is <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0144">Cos every time she goes back to see our specialist he's either on holiday or something so she has to see someone else who doesn't know her history which is really complicated</u>
<u n="137" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0144">so don't know</u>
<u n="139" who="S0013">they should just be looking it up?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0144">mm?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0024">mm?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0013">they should just be looking up her all history?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0024">they <trunc>sho</trunc> they can look it up but when they don't</u>
<u n="144" who="S0144">yeah I think</u>
<u n="145" who="S0024">when they haven't seen her and you know in different situations they can't</u>
<u n="146" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0012">you said they should be looking it up</u>
<u n="149" who="S0024">it's not the same</u>
<u n="150" who="S0012">but you went up to our doctors and they didn't even know you'd been to hospital with a broken wrist</u>
<u n="151" who="S0013">yeah but that was a mistake wasn't it?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0012">it was a big mistake</u>
<u n="153" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="154" who="S0012">they lost all mum's history up the hospital about her broken wrist that she went back to get the plaster on and they said oh you needn't have it then</u>
<u n="155" who="S0013">we got the feeling that it was deliberately wiped off hadn't we?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0024">I went down here and and they said um we'd like you to see like a specialist plastic surgeon for your head and I said no thank you I don't wanna see plastic and cos they were they kept going on about cosmetic surgery</u>
<u n="158" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0024">and I was going no I don't want that I just wanted to talk to someone about something else and they kept going on about it and then three years later when they got my doctor's notes they said oh I <trunc>s</trunc> I see here in your notes you saw a specialist <pause dur="short"/> cos that's when I did go and see a specialist at the university do you remember?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0024">and said you saw a specialist when you were eighteen? I said no I didn't and they showed me all of the notes and a signature to say I'd been to hospital when I was eighteen and I never went</u>
<u n="162" who="S0013">ooh</u>
<u n="163" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="164" who="S0024">and I think the doctors might have covered their backs or something</u>
<u n="165" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0024">I don't know  I don't know  what it was</u>
<u n="167" who="S0144">they're useless</u>
<u n="168" who="S0024">I I couldn't have completely forgotten unless they knocked me out</u>

<u n="178" who="S0024">but it was around when I was eighteen <pause dur="short"/> I remember phoning up here and saying do you remember me going to hospital? I don't remember going <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="179" who="S0012">no no well</u>
<u n="180" who="S0024">unless they completely just knocked me out and dropped me off again</u>
<u n="181" who="S0013" trans="overlap">we took you up the hospital <pause dur="short"/> we took you to the hospital didn't we when you were quite small</u>

<u n="479" who="S0013" trans="overlap">it does everything really <pause dur="short"/> we hardly use it for anything else</u>
<u n="480" who="S0012">they make a microwave for two hundred quid and they stick a stupid little plastic bit in it that wears out and breaks within a year</u>
<u n="481" who="S0024">oh so that you buy another one but actually go well the microwaves are actually very good so let's get the same one <pause dur="short"/> it was only the stupid little plastic bit on the door that stopped it from working but yeah</u>

<u n="489" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="490" who="S0012">but when it comes to the actual working piece with the mechanical piece</u>
<u n="491" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="492" who="S0012">they reckon their designers are using useless <pause dur="short"/> so do I looking at that there</u>
<u n="493" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="494" who="S0024">so you <pause dur="short"/> do you  do you  get most Panasonic or televisions Panasonic and the thingies</u>

<u n="497" who="S0012">we were Sony people</u>
<u n="498" who="S0013">part and part</u>
<u n="499" who="S0024">I don't know what I would choose <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="500" who="S0144">I'd choose what the cheapest <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="501" who="S0024">yeah and then they'd just break</u>

<u n="506" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="507" who="S0144">so they've gone cheap as well</u>
<u n="508" who="S0024">yes so they're all the same now</u>
<u n="509" who="S0144">well everyone gets manufactured in China now <pause dur="short"/> so</u>

<u n="512" who="S0024">well I think Samsung them aren't they gonna get the North Koreans to make some</u>
<u n="513" who="S0012">when we were when we were working on the asphalt we had to go and asphalt Sony's factory down at <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> and they used to produce these little tiny chips that went in in eh transistor radios</u>
<u n="514" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="515" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="516" who="S0012">Cos transistor radios were the big thing then weren't they? And they had these chips about that big</u>

<u n="520" who="S0012">yeah and then when eh when eh everybody got to know how to make them they made them cheaper and sold them cheaper and Sony closed the factory down</u>
