<u n="148" who="S0336">that was my first choice</u>
<u n="149" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yeah it was I put that down on the <unclear/></u>
<u n="150" who="S0336">yeah I I remember watching this thing on TV where like they were saying that erm a lot of criminals have started cos erm they can basically they can work out your code based on cos if so say you've got like four numbers <pause dur="short"/> if it's the person right behind you <pause dur="short"/> thirty-three erm <pause dur="short"/> if you if they come right after you they can do this thing where they like basically they put like this plastic sheet on the thing</u>
<u n="151" who="S0338">oh</u>
<u n="152" who="S0336">and so they can see what the last four</u>
<u n="153" who="S0338" trans="overlap">the pressure</u>
<u n="154" who="S0336">cos of the cos you leave heat marks or something</u>
<u n="155" who="S0338">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0336">or actually it's an app it's an app so that if they hold their phone over the erm payment thing it can pick up the heat signals like it's like thermal you know like the thermal imaging that you see the police interceptors using?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="158" who="S0336">like it's an app that does the same thing so what it does is it highlights the last four numbers that were used and obviously that really limits what the <pause dur="short"/> the kind of</u>
<u n="159" who="S0338">yes</u>
<u n="160" who="S0336" trans="overlap">different codes it could be <pause dur="short"/> well actually because obviously the the one that shows up the strongest will have been the last one you pressed <pause dur="short"/> so they can kind of work out what your code is so they were saying like erm when you do it you should put like all your <trunc>fi</trunc> like put all your fingers on</u>
<u n="161" who="S0338" trans="overlap">fingers on everything</u>
<u n="162" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0338">I'm gonna start doing that as well</u>
<u n="164" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0338">cos I don't trust anybody</u>
<u n="166" who="S0336">no and you shouldn't really</u>
<u n="167" who="S0338">no</u>
<u n="168" who="S0336">but the thing is as well you know like even if they have your code they still have to get hold of your card to be able to</u>
<u n="169" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="170" who="S0336">do anything with it so</u>
<u n="171" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yeah the thing is if anything happened with any of the the numbers and things I would feel so violated</u>
<u n="172" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="173" who="S0338">it would really affect me</u>
<u n="174" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="175" who="S0338">cos when they the when they had the attempted break-in in the house the boys were quite small but it really did affect me for a long long time</u>
<u n="176" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0338">and I was seconds away from opening the kitchen door and seeing that person at that window if I'd have done that I would have had to leave</u>
<u n="178" who="S0336">I think it really shocked my mum when we had our break-in</u>
<u n="179" who="S0338" trans="overlap">that person went in</u>
<u n="180" who="S0336">yeah cos as you <trunc>sa</trunc> er obviously she was like fairly recently single as well so I think</u>
<u n="181" who="S0338" trans="overlap">oh god</u>
<u n="182" who="S0336" trans="overlap">she was like she wasn't really used to just being the only one in the house so</u>
<u n="183" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0336">I think he really shook her it wasn't long after that that we moved</u>
<u n="185" who="S0338">yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0336" trans="overlap">I don't think it was linked I think that there was a lot of reasons why we moved but I do think mum just didn't feel very safe there anymore</u>
<u n="187" who="S0338">yes</u>
<u n="188" who="S0336">we certainly went through a period of having to lock the door as soon as you got in the house which just wasn't a very nice feeling</u>
<u n="189" who="S0338">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="190" who="S0336" trans="overlap">we do that now though I think it's it's not a bad habit to get into is it really?</u>
<u n="191" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yeah it's changed everything's changed <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> the world's changed</u>
<u n="192" who="S0336">I think it would be different if we had people coming in and out of the house but once I know me and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> are in it's like oh I might as well lock the door</u>
<u n="193" who="S0338" trans="overlap">lock the door</u>
<u n="194" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="195" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yeah we do yeah and if we're eating I always lock the front door</u>
<u n="196" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="197" who="S0338">didn't used to <pause dur="short"/> I do it now I certainly do now</u>
<u n="198" who="S0336">it would be really easy for you to not notice though wouldn't it really? especially like if you and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> are having dinner in the kitchen</u>
<u n="199" who="S0338" trans="overlap">in the kitchen and the TV's on <pause dur="short"/> and the door's closed</u>
<u n="200" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah you wouldn't have a clue</u>
<u n="201" who="S0338">and there's been a few times I've heard things and I felt oh it's the cat <pause dur="short"/> but perhaps you should check</u>
<u n="202" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="203" who="S0338">yeah anyway are you well?</u>
<u n="204" who="S0336">yeah I'm well</u>
<u n="205" who="S0338">just the commute</u>
<u n="206" who="S0336">yeah and do you know what? like I'm getting used to it I think if I can make it through winter I think that would be a fairly significant step because it was easy enough during the summer because it was</u>
<u n="207" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="208" who="S0336">it wasn't a bad drive and <pause dur="short"/> especially over the summer holidays obviously there was less traffic on the road so it's actually quite a nice like</u>
<u n="209" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="415" who="S0337" trans="overlap">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="416" who="S0338" trans="overlap">that you wouldn't normally buy for yourselves so there's some really weirdy things and then there's some just practical things and then surprises and then some lovely things</u>

<u n="418" who="S0338">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="long"/> so you're erm a good few erm <pause dur="short"/> months into the mortgage now</u>
<u n="419" who="S0336">I know it's pretty scary <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>

<u n="422" who="S0338">yeah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0336">I think we might start trying to overpay a little bit on the mortgage because I just the way I see it is <pause dur="short"/> the best part about what we've been able to do now is that it'll help us put some money down</u>
<u n="424" who="S0338">yes</u>
<u n="425" who="S0336" trans="overlap">so that the next time we buy</u>
<u n="426" who="S0338">yes</u>
<u n="427" who="S0336">we can <trunc>b</trunc> obviously buy on our own</u>
<u n="428" who="S0338" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="429" who="S0336" trans="overlap">erm but I think as it stands only about a third of what we pay each month is going against the capital</u>
<u n="430" who="S0338">right</u>
<u n="431" who="S0336">so obviously if we could afford to overpay a little bit each month it's just gonna boost up what we have</u>
<u n="432" who="S0338" trans="overlap">of course it will</u>
