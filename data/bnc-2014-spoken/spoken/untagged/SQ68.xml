<u n="46" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's what I'm probably gonna use little sticky-outy ones with</u>
<u n="47" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="49" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0509"><trunc>s</trunc> cos I've seen like people use different coloured highlighters or different coloured erm underlining pens for different themes</u>

<u n="52" who="S0509">or characters</u>
<u n="53" who="S0510">I saw that you did that for your timetable actually you know you sort of colour coded</u>

<u n="60" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah so we were doing that and we had we had a different teacher today <pause dur="short"/> she seemed okay <pause dur="short"/> she was alright <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0510">oh did you find out from uncle <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the name of erm <pause dur="short"/> his friend?</u>

<u n="63" who="S0510">it was just a <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="64" who="S0509" trans="overlap">and I have got an English teacher called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="65" who="S0510">ah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0509">so I'm presuming it's her</u>
<u n="67" who="S0510" trans="overlap">so <pause dur="short"/> it's just one and the same yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> which is interesting</u>
<u n="69" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0509">but erm <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah and then there was <pause dur="short"/> english language and what were we doing in English language? <pause dur="short"/> oh my gosh I can't oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> we were <trunc>g</trunc>giving us all this vocabulary about syntaxes and</u>
<u n="71" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0509">morpheme and <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="73" who="S0510" trans="overlap">who phemes?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0509">morphemes</u>
<u n="75" who="S0510">well I I've heard of morphine you know but not morphemes</u>
<u n="76" who="S0509" trans="overlap">and like <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> very different</u>
<u n="77" who="S0510">what morphemes two separate words or?</u>
<u n="78" who="S0509" trans="overlap">no <trunc>mor</trunc>morpheme <pause dur="short"/> so one word <pause dur="short"/> and a morpheme</u>
<u n="79" who="S0510" trans="overlap">I've not heard of that before</u>
<u n="80" who="S0509" trans="overlap">is the smallest unit of language you can have <pause dur="short"/> so it's like</u>
<u n="81" who="S0510">oh right</u>
<u n="82" who="S0509" trans="overlap">it's like <pause dur="short"/> anti or dis</u>
<u n="83" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="84" who="S0509" trans="overlap">instead so it has a meaning but it's the smallest unit of language <pause dur="short"/> and then you combine <pause dur="short"/> morphemes to make a lexical term which is just a word</u>
<u n="85" who="S0510"><vocal desc="sigh"/> oh you're blowing my mind now</u>
<u n="86" who="S0509" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and then it and then it goes on and on with like eight different steps it's ridiculous</u>
<u n="87" who="S0510">oh wow oh well you</u>
<u n="88" who="S0509">yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0510">you'll be able to er impress grandad with all of that or certainly uncle <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> anyway</u>
<u n="90" who="S0509" trans="overlap">that's a good idea</u>
<u n="91" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0509">I feel that like grandad would know about all of that</u>
<u n="93" who="S0510">mm mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0509">yes <pause dur="short"/> and now I've gotta do an essay on <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> what was it? <pause dur="short"/> oh on different <pause dur="short"/> er prescriptive versus descriptive in relation to grammar</u>
<u n="95" who="S0510" trans="overlap">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> uhu?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0509">like whether we should just be like this is how you use grammar or <trunc>eth</trunc> or whether we should be like <pause dur="short"/> this is how grammar is being used</u>
<u n="97" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0509">and we also watched this documentary</u>
<u n="99" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0509">on this Amazon tribe</u>
<u n="101" who="S0510">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0509" trans="overlap">and they have this really weird language that they can whistle and hum as well as speak it</u>
<u n="103" who="S0510">oh <pause dur="short"/> god I'd love to see that</u>
<u n="104" who="S0509">yeah it's interesting but there's only three people in the world who can speak it <pause dur="short"/> and one of them is this linguist who's doing all this research into them</u>
<u n="105" who="S0510">outside of the tribe you mean?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0509" trans="overlap">yeah outside of the tribe yeah <pause dur="short"/> outside of the tribe <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="107" who="S0510" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="108" who="S0509">there's only three people who can speak it outside of the tribe</u>
<u n="109" who="S0510">oh right?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0509">and erm <pause dur="short"/> one of them is a linguist who's doing all this research on them</u>
<u n="111" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0509">and er he he's saying <pause dur="short"/> they don't have <pause dur="short"/> they don't have words for colours <pause dur="short"/> or numbers</u>
<u n="113" who="S0510" trans="overlap">right <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="114" who="S0509">or a past or future tense</u>
<u n="115" who="S0510">oh that's interesting I'm sure there's another erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> group of people that I dunno whether it was the Aboriginals or <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure there's another group of people that don't use a sort of past</u>
<u n="116" who="S0509">mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0510">or future</u>
<u n="118" who="S0509">but</u>
<u n="119" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0509">the thing is there's this guy who's like the father of modern linguistics and he's made</u>
<u n="121" who="S0510">right</u>
<u n="122" who="S0509">that he thinks there are these grammatical rules that are inherent</u>
<u n="123" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0509">in humans <pause dur="short"/> erm and this idea of the <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="sigh"/> can't remember what it is but it's <pause dur="short"/> there's a word for it and it's basically the idea that you can keep adding <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> it's like recursive or something and</u>
<u n="125" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0509">you can keep adding <pause dur="short"/> different</u>
<u n="127" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="128" who="S0509">clauses to sentences <pause dur="short"/> to make it <pause dur="short"/> longer and you can do that infinitely</u>
<u n="129" who="S0510"><vocal desc="misc"/> oh right</u>
<u n="130" who="S0509">but in this <trunc>langu</trunc> and he says you can do that in any language that's <pause dur="short"/> in-built in humans but you can't do it in this language this guy's saying and they all hate him for it</u>
<u n="131" who="S0510" trans="overlap">uhu <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="132" who="S0509" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> but it's like is he telling the truth because there are only three people that can speak this language</u>
<u n="133" who="S0510" trans="overlap">can speak it</u>
<u n="134" who="S0510" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="135" who="S0509">so you know <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="136" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah let's the other two people on board too yeah</u>

<u n="139" who="S0509">yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0510">so because of all the terrible sort of logging that's being done with the Amazonian Indians and <pause dur="short"/> moving them out of their</u>
