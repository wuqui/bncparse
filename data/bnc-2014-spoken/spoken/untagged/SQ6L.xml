<u n="1" who="S0037">did you see this thing? Have I showed you this before?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0115">no what is it?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0037">it's a word cloud</u>
<u n="4" who="S0115">oh yeah taken from your own that's your own corpus that you made is it?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no it's my thesis</u>
<u n="6" who="S0115">oh thesis itself <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="7" who="S0037">I thought I might frame it or something as a little reminder</u>
<u n="8" who="S0115"><anon type="place"/>'s the biggest then data then dialect then English then uh construction um</u>
<u n="9" who="S0037" trans="overlap">eG's quite big</u>
<u n="10" who="S0115">but they haven't got n-grams and if they did there'd probably be in terms of like about uh</u>
<u n="11" who="S0037" trans="overlap">you can <pause dur="short"/> you can  you can  add them <pause dur="short"/> I thought about doing that this was me first go <pause dur="short"/> cos you can add in terms of and you <trunc>c</trunc> like you you separate them with what's that symbol called? It looks like this</u>
<u n="12" who="S0115">it'd be better if they did that and then made it like um like a classifier classified it in terms of where they are</u>
<u n="13" who="S0037" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0115">merge in the n-grams <pause dur="short"/> so like you could  you could  deselect uh like you could say in terms of is okay but it's it's not a content is it?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0037">I should definitely put that in it'll probably come out like massive won't it?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0115">doesn't like so you've got like <trunc>S</trunc> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that that's uh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like obviously it's a named entity d'you what I mean like if you  if you  semantic tagged it</u>
<u n="17" who="S0037" trans="overlap">and <anon type="place"/> is in there cos <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah but it's interesting I mean <pause dur="short"/> cos cos <anon type="place"/> is in there but it's obviously from like <anon type="place"/> like the all the references are in there <pause dur="short"/> which I should've probably put in</u>
<u n="18" who="S0115" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> so this is the sort of language app that I think people would pay for isn't it?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0037">well it's free it's online</u>
<u n="20" who="S0115" trans="overlap">perhaps <pause dur="short"/> I mean</u>
<u n="21" who="S0037">I put the Bible in as well just to see</u>
<u n="22" who="S0115">oh that'd be really <trunc>inter</trunc> you know I'd really like to do more work with other corpora like obviously I'm doing my own stuff now like</u>
<u n="23" who="S0037">so not not just because I'm <trunc>j</trunc></u>
<u n="24" who="S0115">you could use like  you could use like  K F N-gram to get uh</u>
<u n="25" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0115">to get your <trunc>l</trunc> the n-gram list <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah I was wondering if you could um do another one on the <trunc>G</trunc> German uh half of the uh half of the corpus uh</u>
<u n="27" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> just send me the file I'll I don't mind doing it <pause dur="short"/> of course <pause dur="short"/> but um</u>
<u n="28" who="S0115">Cos uh yeah for that thing I was telling you yesterday <pause dur="short"/> I I decided that it would be easiest to do a find and replaced string thing after Berkeley yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0115">is to change it after directly after Berkeley</u>
<u n="31" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0115">then um uh as soon as  as soon as</u>
<u n="33" who="S0037">ah your problem with the thing</u>
<u n="34" who="S0115">yeah that that means that I would wanna change it as soon as Berkeley splits it out <pause dur="short"/> like so that  so that  it doesn't get cause any further problems and like can nip it in the bud as soon as it's out of Berkeley so I wonder if string find and replace but</u>
<u n="35" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well that's alright I mean</u>
<u n="36" who="S0115">I need unfortunately I need a list of every single word so that I can swap them</u>
<u n="37" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well that's okay I can do that <pause dur="short"/> uh anyway yeah so</u>
<u n="38" who="S0115" trans="overlap">it will probably come in handy later actually I imagine that list <pause dur="short"/> so this is like basic language model but</u>
<u n="39" who="S0037">so but you can add in like um n-grams by you know that  you know that you know that you know that  thing?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah and semantic tagging?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0037">what's that symbol that looks like that? Like that?</u>
<u n="42" who="S0115">A tilde</u>
<u n="43" who="S0037">A tilde <pause dur="short"/> but it's not a hat tilde it's just a normal character</u>
<u n="44" who="S0115">yeah in mathematics does it mean approximately or something?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0037">I'm not sure <pause dur="short"/> anyway so you can put those in then you can it generates n-grams <pause dur="short"/> but yeah so I put the Bible in just to see what it would be <pause dur="short"/> and like it was Lord was the biggest one and then unto was the next one</u>
<u n="46" who="S0115"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I think you've used the King James one there and not the um you've not used the modern</u>
<u n="47" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I did use the King James one well done <pause dur="short"/> well no I was just  I was just  on</u>
<u n="48" who="S0115" trans="overlap">could use the Tyndale one</u>
<u n="49" who="S0037">and I put like um Sense and <trunc>Sensibil</trunc> uh Pride and Prejudice in</u>
<u n="50" who="S0115">hey I tell you I can tell you two people who'd be quite interested in seeing that I mean</u>
<u n="51" who="S0037">well I'll do one for when they come round and then</u>
<u n="52" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I know they they cos like these sorts of things um really is the the sort of way isn't it?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well it's just all it's just free it's called Wordle online and you just  you just  well you can either link to a webpage and it'll um tell you all of the things or you can just paste in loads of text and I pasted my whole thesis in so <pause dur="short"/> that's obviously like</u>
<u n="54" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0037">I'll not say how many thousand words cos that's contentious <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0115">well how can a number how can a count of anything be contentious?</u>
<u n="57" who="S0037">well because it was a little bit under what it should've been wasn't it?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0115">I dunno I mean I I never officially counted it myself but I can only</u>
<u n="59" who="S0037" trans="overlap">oh did you not? I counted it with</u>
<u n="60" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um I can only speculate them</u>
<u n="61" who="S0037">well it was  it was  just about on the lower limit but I counted like every scrap of text like all of the bibliography and everything</u>
<u n="62" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0037">that was a bit naughty <pause dur="short"/> so it was a little bit underweight but you know it's what you write not how much you write isn't it?</u>
<u n="64" who="S0115">it's what you <pause dur="short"/> yeah of course because because you could waffle on and on in a really big <trunc>f</trunc> you know flabby sort of text</u>
<u n="65" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0115">which uh you know sometimes I suppose some of the constructions you used were maybe a bit more verbose than they could've been but uh</u>
<u n="67" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well you you tried to root those out</u>
<u n="68" who="S0115">but I the key thing with your one was getting the SVO order and getting the verb early</u>
<u n="69" who="S0037">yeah I know I'm like a non-native speaker <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="70" who="S0115" trans="overlap">getting the finite gotta get that finite verb early so that <trunc>s</trunc> the person knows what the tense is early and they know what the</u>
<u n="71" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I know</u>
<u n="72" who="S0115">I dunno I suppose in German they they always put the finite verb it can can end up right at the very end</u>
<u n="73" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah maybe I'm more German than you think <pause dur="short"/> no I mean maybe maybe it's like</u>
<u n="74" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0037">maybe I just <pause dur="short"/> I dunno where I got that writing style from</u>
<u n="76" who="S0115">no because you don't speak like that that's the thing</u>
<u n="77" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I know</u>
<u n="78" who="S0115">I think you're just trying to overwork <pause dur="short"/> trying to over-academicize your work maybe <pause dur="short"/> should be more perhaps more informal</u>
<u n="79" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well that's <pause dur="short"/> maybe <pause dur="short"/> I know <pause dur="short"/> maybe I shoulda been <pause dur="short"/> I never mastered it like I never got the hang of that</u>
<u n="80" who="S0115">on the subject of PhDs someone had to resign didn't they <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="81" who="S0037">who?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0115">uh the President of <trunc>Har</trunc> uh Hungary</u>
<u n="83" who="S0037">president of Hungary?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0115">he's had to resign</u>
<u n="85" who="S0037">why?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0115">because his PhD thesis was fake</u>
<u n="87" who="S0037">was it? Like Gillian O'Keith's? Gillian McKeith's?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0115">I don't think hers was fake I think it just wasn't a thesis I think she just paid money and got a PhD</u>
<u n="89" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well she bought it didn't she? She looks at turds anyway <pause dur="short"/> you don't need a thesis to do that</u>
<u n="90" who="S0115">uh <pause dur="short"/> on the contrary I'm sure there's lots of interesting things you can do with that but um</u>
<u n="91" who="S0037" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0115">no someone else was accused of it <trunc>u</trunc> uh Alan Greenspan was accused of it</u>
<u n="93" who="S0037">aha</u>
<u n="94" who="S0115">but no no he <pause dur="short"/> no he was accused of getting other people to write it for him <pause dur="short"/> that's a different like</u>
<u n="95" who="S0037" trans="overlap">and actually <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>magra</trunc> not Magrahi <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="96" who="S0115" trans="overlap">in fact you've got <pause dur="short"/> this is is what we were on about like with the text <pause dur="short"/> like it's <trunc>alwa</trunc> it's a bit controversial <pause dur="short"/> like I I does it  does it  mean plagiarized as in simply cut and paste or does it mean that you paid and bought someone else's after they'd done it or something?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0037" trans="overlap">excuse me <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> well it has to be your own work doesn't it? In fact you sign a declaration</u>
<u n="98" who="S0115" trans="overlap">uh his name was Pal Schmidt</u>
<u n="99" who="S0037">Ohh <pause dur="short"/> you sign a declaration <pause dur="short"/> a declaration? You sign the declaration saying like this is all my own work <pause dur="short"/> what what are they for?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was wondering</u>
<u n="101" who="S0037">for the dinner for the sauce?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0115">like d'you want that or do you want uh um something more spicy?</u>
<u n="103" who="S0037" trans="overlap">uh I dunno what we gonna have? <trunc>Pas</trunc>? Pasta? Pasta?</u>
<u n="104" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0037">um <pause dur="short"/> like Italian? We could have like Italian sort of we've got <pause dur="short"/> we've got like chives and parsley haven't we that I've planted so?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0115" trans="overlap">that's what  that's what  my idea was yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah so well I'll just uh just do that then</u>
<u n="107" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I can go and get some <pause dur="short"/> but we're not having that for a while though if we're gonna have those pasties <pause dur="short"/> I'll not be able to eat like</u>
<u n="108" who="S0115">ah well you know I was just sort of getting things <unclear/> started and I'll just um</u>
<u n="109" who="S0037" trans="overlap">ah right no we'll <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah no we'll get it on <pause dur="short"/> yeah no that's fine <pause dur="short"/> did the kettle  did the kettle  boil?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0115">it it did actually um</u>
<u n="111" who="S0037">so</u>
<u n="112" who="S0115">so so yeah I mean so there's a lot of things you can do <pause dur="short"/> phDs I mean so they they do tend to uh like check <pause dur="short"/> but actually Al Greenspan's PhD like um there's only two copies in the world or something</u>
<u n="113" who="S0037">how can that even be the case?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0115" trans="overlap">there's only his copy which he he doesn't want anyone to see <pause dur="short"/> and like the the the reviewer's copy</u>
<u n="115" who="S0037" trans="overlap">the one in the <trunc>univers</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> no the university will hold one</u>
<u n="116" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah yeah the university's copy yeah <pause dur="short"/> that was those are the only two copies that there were</u>
<u n="117" who="S0037">yeah but you can request to see it can't you?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0115" trans="overlap">but um and someone someone from paper or some blog had managed to you know do some research work and get and obtain the other copy</u>
<u n="119" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0115">uh it was an economics paper like uh maybe Bloomberg or something I dunno <pause dur="short"/> um they read you know they read it but it's a  it's a  proper economics PhD so</u>
<u n="121" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0115">it was difficult had a lot of formulas and that's always suspicious it's um you know?</u>
<u n="123" who="S0037">yeah overly difficult</u>
<u n="124" who="S0115" trans="overlap">like if you're using extra formulas to try and sort of confuse people but uh</u>
<u n="125" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0115">I think he Greenspan's was uh was was okay it's just that I think he <trunc>d</trunc> he'd released them all as papers like he he got like <pause dur="short"/> but he was doing loads of other stuff at the like he was working whilst doing it</u>
<u n="127" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0115">he was just <pause dur="short"/> he was a bit of a celebrity I think already before it had even come out <pause dur="short"/> um but he ended up being uh head of the Chairman of the <trunc>Fed</trunc></u>
<u n="129" who="S0037">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0115"> eral Reserve Bank thing</u>
<u n="131" who="S0037">have you still not eaten that chocolate from the other day?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0115">yeah this is from  this is from  uh it's from Saturday this is innit</u>
<u n="133" who="S0037" trans="overlap">God I dunno how you can <pause dur="short"/> I would've just been <pause dur="short"/> I would've eaten it straight away <pause dur="short"/> I'm can't help meself</u>
<u n="134" who="S0115">and Friday <pause dur="short"/> I've still got Friday's in there <vocal desc="laugh"/> There's not loads but some of it went in Saturday's meal</u>
<u n="135" who="S0037" trans="overlap">D'you know what man if you don't eat that it'll <trunc>mag</trunc> the the chocolate fairies'll get it</u>
<u n="136" who="S0115"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Ah I think I'd like to to do a bit of like uh what do they call it when uh countries are hoard masses of gold and what is it yeah what are must be stockpiling of commodities</u>
<u n="137" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah stockpile? You you're like panic buying <vocal desc="laugh"/>?</u>
<u n="138" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well just just saving just refusing to to actually spend <trunc>ea</trunc> eat consume any of the uh commodity</u>
<u n="139" who="S0037" trans="overlap">oh that's alright it's <trunc>f</trunc> I shouldn't have bought any more should I if you've still got that</u>
<u n="140" who="S0115">it's funny with gold cos you can't really eat it well you can like uh you can have gold leaf yeah but it would take you quite a long time to eat your way through like a whole</u>
<u n="141" who="S0037" trans="overlap">there is edible gold leaf <pause dur="short"/> I saw like a <pause dur="short"/> bar?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0115">the problem with that is that you're sort of destroying the gold aren't you cos like once you've eaten it it's not really possible to <trunc>re</trunc> to <trunc>r</trunc> <trunc>re</trunc> to retrieve the</u>
<u n="143" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but does it come out though? It can't just like <pause dur="short"/> it can't just hang out in your body</u>
<u n="144" who="S0115" trans="overlap">your uh your word cloud on this is gonna be good isn't it?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0037">me what?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0115">you know <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> the uh</u>
<u n="147" who="S0037" trans="overlap">on this conversation?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0115">the yeah if you stick it through there it's gonna come out with like Alan Greenspan and like uh</u>
<u n="149" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0115">uh eating gold and retrieving the gold after it's been eaten</u>
<u n="151" who="S0037">well <pause dur="short"/> these are all valid questions</u>
<u n="152" who="S0115">I I dunno how much gold gold leaf you could get out of uh</u>
<u n="153" who="S0037">where's your cup</u>
<u n="154" who="S0115">like I wonder how many miles or sort of square metres of gold leaf you can get out of like a <trunc>w</trunc> one um</u>
<u n="155" who="S0037" trans="overlap">A bullion? One bullion thing?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0037">no it'll be on the <unclear/> I saw a thing that Michel Roux Junior made where he put like <trunc>e</trunc> he put like gold leaf on something and it kind of makes me feel that I wouldn't wanna eat it that it might jangle on me fillings</u>
<u n="158" who="S0115"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I don't  I don't  think I'd ever want to eat it I think um <pause dur="short"/> I don't wanna know what it tastes like but I imagine it tastes of metal <pause dur="short"/> like hard</u>
<u n="159" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I don't really like gold anyway <pause dur="short"/> like I don't like the <trunc>m</trunc> like I don't like it aesthetically</u>

<u n="489" who="S0115">that's probably the one of the most obvious ones uh could go to like a part of London that we haven't seen</u>

<u n="491" who="S0115">as much <trunc>li</trunc> like um uh Chelsea like Chelsea uh</u>

<u n="493" who="S0115">like um</u>
<u n="494" who="S0037">maybe</u>
<u n="495" who="S0115">uh <pause dur="short"/> some of the parts of London</u>
<u n="496" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I dunno we went there not long ago though <pause dur="short"/> I'd rather go like somewhere different I think</u>

<u n="498" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no no I know <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but we might go <pause dur="short"/> I said like to Chris we might go and see him at some point so</u>

<u n="501" who="S0115">I mean part of the <pause dur="short"/> yeah part of the problem with going to um some of the places are the expensive fares but I think London <pause dur="short"/> places you can get to on the bus like London are likely to be reasonably priced</u>
<u n="502" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well maybe I'll have a look at the bus and see if there's any others</u>
<u n="503" who="S0115" trans="overlap">so it's only um <pause dur="short"/> what is it fifteen pounds to London?</u>
<u n="504" who="S0037">mm depends when you go less <pause dur="short"/> I think there was only twelve last time</u>
<u n="505" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um the bus that's really  that's really  pleasantly cheap but uh</u>

<u n="508" who="S0037">yeah six pounds</u>
<u n="509" who="S0115" trans="overlap">the train  the train  would be uh one would be uh <pause dur="short"/> so if there were the buses were going to other towns then we might've been able to consider that as well <pause dur="short"/> and sort of possibly the day trips</u>
<u n="510" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I'm sure they do <pause dur="short"/> we could go to Oxford maybe <pause dur="short"/> I know the <anon type="place"/> goes there <pause dur="short"/> from just along there</u>
