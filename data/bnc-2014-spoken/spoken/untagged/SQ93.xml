<u n="64" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah did you check the date before you drunk it?</u>

<u n="79" who="S0390">I don't know I don't I don't go into those sort of things</u>
<u n="80" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that said it will be fine it doesn't instantly overnight just turn does it?</u>

<u n="82" who="S0392">yeah oh your eyes?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0390">er no normally it's your nose you know if it's a tin and either you are pulling it or you are putting a a tin opener in there's a <pause dur="short"/> if it's if it's off you know because it smells horribly</u>
<u n="84" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0390">and what have you been up to this week?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0392">erm on Monday I <pause dur="short"/> nothing in particular Tuesday well that was quite interesting I had there was I was a a bit stuck on Tuesday because I didn't know what was going to happen whether I was going to be going to the area cricket trials in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="87" who="S0390" trans="overlap">right <pause dur="short"/> and did you?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0392">I didn't no I had to go somewhere else instead I had to go to Ripon with the music department to pick up this violin off the lady you know sort of near Morrisons so we went there</u>
<u n="89" who="S0390" trans="overlap">eurgh <pause dur="short"/> so that was the lady <trunc>wha</trunc></u>
<u n="90" who="S0392">you know I told you about</u>
<u n="91" who="S0390">yes</u>
<u n="92" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0390">tell me again I keep forgetting</u>
<u n="94" who="S0392">well she her husband had died and she was full of this violin that he had I talked to her about how good it was and then we had to collect that off her because she was giving it to us</u>
<u n="95" who="S0390" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> mm mm <pause dur="short"/> your mum or school?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0392">no me and the music teachers so I was a bit disappointed about that really</u>
<u n="97" who="S0390">why?</u>
<u n="98" who="S0392">because I could've been at the trials and playing for the area and I'd have got a little thing for my blazer that says cricket on it still never mind</u>
<u n="99" who="S0390">ah <pause dur="short"/> ah <pause dur="short"/> ah <pause dur="short"/> well does this mean you won't get a chance again?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0392">it means I won't be able to play for but it doesn't bother me too much I mean I can play for clubs and schools and things so that doesn't matter I'm not too bothered about that but still we went to get the instrument from the lady in <anon type="place"/> it was quite fun the the journey and everything and erm getting there and she gave us it and she really enjoyed it and we asked her to come back to the the concert in summer and there we said you can have a bowl of strawberries <unclear/> I didn't know she was allergic to strawberries and we said you can have a bowl of raspberries and cream but she's allergic to cream so she so we are just going to get her a bowl of raspberries yeah and then she gave us all the stuff so I have to sort through that and the fiddle's is <unclear/> thing</u>
<u n="101" who="S0390" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> oh dear <pause dur="short"/> oh dear well <pause dur="short"/> is it music as well?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0392">yeah there's a bit of that which I'm going to see for the orchestra which they can have and there's a music stand as well but I've left that with them a tuning fork as well that I've kept and a couple of bows as well which are handy I suppose because you can I've always been worried about one of my bows breaking <pause dur="short"/> erm so if I've got a spare that's a lot easier and then Wednesday erm just a normal Wednesday really and yesterday we had a match after school against <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="103" who="S0390" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> mm mm mm mm <pause dur="short"/> ah <pause dur="short"/> cricket?</u>
<u n="104" who="S0392">yeah but that was really disappointing because our batsman didn't really get going at the start and the wicket was really hard to bowl off because it was just like a flat bit of carpet in the middle of a field where you're running in your spikes then all of a sudden half way through your run up there's like a carpet so you have to adapt to that so it's difficult to bowl on and plus they had this one person who looked about twenty-five he was <unclear/> hammered</u>
<u n="105" who="S0390" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> was he a sixth former?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0392">no no they had to he had to be in year ten but he looked about twenty-five he just <unclear>palmed him off somewhere</unclear> and he didn't really have any skill but he just had brute force that at <unclear> our age</unclear> that's all you need really</u>
<u n="107" who="S0390">well I wouldn't have thought that brute force would've enabled you to hit the ball yes when you've actually hit it</u>
<u n="108" who="S0392">yeah well that's the thing yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0390">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0392">and there were two of us who were bowling well but the other people didn't really and one of our players didn't turn up either so if we play them as our teacher said if we play them again we'd beat them every single time after that but it was just that first time they took us by surprise with it because just like the way they played and everything it was really different</u>
<u n="111" who="S0390">well they had the advantage it was their field</u>
<u n="112" who="S0392">well you don't really find that to be honest that's not really a <unclear/></u>
<u n="113" who="S0390">but you just said it was like a piece of carpet and you had to</u>
<u n="114" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah but they but they had to play off it as well so they had the difficulty</u>
<u n="115" who="S0390">but if it was theirs they're used to it</u>
<u n="116" who="S0392">no because we have a carpet at our school and we really hate it and it you you just can't get used to it I know what you mean but it's just impossible to get used to</u>
<u n="117" who="S0390">it's not an actual carpet is it?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0392">yeah it's a carpet</u>
<u n="119" who="S0390">or is it grass? you know artificial</u>
<u n="120" who="S0392">it's well it's like a carpet of green grass</u>
<u n="121" who="S0390">artificial?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0392">yeah so it's a carpet</u>
<u n="123" who="S0390">mm mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0392">we've got one at our school and you never get used to it plus you're playing away all the time at proper pitches and with the club you playing on a proper pitch as well so</u>
<u n="125" who="S0390"><trunc>w</trunc>which club?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0392">well any club that you play for they all have proper pitches</u>
<u n="127" who="S0390">and which clubs do you play for?</u>
<u n="128" who="S0392">I haven't really decided this year because there's some people wanted me to do one and some people wanted me to do the other</u>
<u n="129" who="S0390">and so</u>
<u n="130" who="S0392">yeah and I want to do one but then I feel sorry for the other so I'm just going to have to decide</u>
<u n="131" who="S0390">you can't play for both?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0392">no they play on the same night I'm afraid</u>
<u n="133" who="S0390">oh well</u>
<u n="134" who="S0392">and then today er we were discussing what had happened last night erm just having a laugh it was good fun though like the journey and scoring and everything because you get a lot of time when you're just sitting down when you're waiting for all the people to get back which is great fun</u>
<u n="135" who="S0390">so you go on a bus? oh that's good and mum and dad pick you up at the end?</u>
<u n="136" who="S0392" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> er no the bus brings you back to school</u>
<u n="137" who="S0390">that's what I mean and then your mum and dad have to come and pick you up</u>
<u n="138" who="S0392">yeah that's it <pause dur="short"/> well no <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> just came and got me</u>
<u n="139" who="S0390">right</u>
<u n="140" who="S0392">there were other people saying if they wanted to drop me off but no I said it's alright well nobody it would they would have to be going out of their way really</u>
<u n="141" who="S0390"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and there's your poor mum with a twenty-four hour virus oh what a shame shame on you <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="142" who="S0392">twenty-four hours she was better by then I think it mustn't have been too bad so it must be twenty-four hours</u>
<u n="143" who="S0390" trans="overlap">right <pause dur="short"/> I met <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah I I met <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> in Tesco's and oh it was such a <pause dur="short"/> you know Tesco's is built for big people and if there's anything on the top shelf I can't reach it</u>

<u n="218" who="S0392">no they only do some of it you only do like thirty percent this year or something yeah that makes sense thirty percent</u>
<u n="219" who="S0390">I think <unclear/></u>
<u n="220" who="S0392">yeah well he sort of has an advantage doesn't he so he's er is he doing all the year early within sort of being?</u>

<u n="231" who="S0390" trans="overlap">yes very good yes <pause dur="short"/> mm mm <pause dur="short"/> well it gets you in <pause dur="short"/> it takes the fear away</u>
<u n="232" who="S0392">well it takes a lot of the pressure away as well</u>
<u n="233" who="S0390">yeah yes <pause dur="short"/> oh dear</u>
<u n="234" who="S0392">and it makes it more you work harder as well because you know that this stuff actually counts</u>
<u n="235" who="S0390">mm I mean we just had it all in one year</u>
<u n="236" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah for biology what I'm going to have to do is just <pause dur="short"/> wait until the half term or so before and then just learn all of it really because we don't really learn much to be honest because it's all just hard <trunc>I</trunc>I've noticed a lot of people have that problem all around the</u>
<u n="237" who="S0390">with biology?</u>
<u n="238" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="239" who="S0390">do you think it's the long names for all the?</u>
<u n="240" who="S0392">I think it's just like how there's so much stuff and it's all none of it's particularly inspiring that's on the curriculum nowadays it could it could be the best subject if you did what people like because everyone's interested in animals really aren't they? everybody loves animals people are interested in seeing plants and things but when you start talking about cells and bacteria I think that people don't really</u>
<u n="241" who="S0390" trans="overlap">no it's not no <pause dur="short"/> oh yes <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> I don't think we did that</u>
<u n="242" who="S0392">I mean cells it doesn't really matter to be honest</u>
<u n="243" who="S0390">but do you do human biology?</u>
<u n="244" who="S0392">do a little bit of it but it's never the interesting subjects it's always about how nervous system works and things</u>
<u n="245" who="S0390">I would think that would be quite useful</u>
<u n="246" who="S0392">not really</u>
<u n="247" who="S0390">well it</u>
<u n="248" who="S0392">motor neurones synapses</u>
<u n="249" who="S0390" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> oh dear yes</u>
<u n="250" who="S0392">and you've got to know how everything works</u>
<u n="251" who="S0390">do they ever have these sort of multiple choice questions still?</u>
<u n="252" who="S0392">they got rid of those about four years three or four years ago yeah</u>
<u n="253" who="S0390">never really?</u>
<u n="254" who="S0392">it's all written now and that's the problem because if you don't quite word your answer the way it's in the mark scheme then it's a big cross you can</u>
<u n="255" who="S0390" trans="overlap">that's wrong <unclear>if that's not right then</unclear></u>
<u n="256" who="S0392">there was a question suggest reasons and I put something I'd heard in the news that morning and obviously with it not being on the mark scheme I didn't get anything for it but I'm wise to that now I just stick to</u>
<u n="257" who="S0390">that that's not education that's just sort of regurgitating</u>
<u n="258" who="S0392">well at the this level they they don't really care if you think about the kind of people that write the exams or of that they'll all they'll say ah GCSE everyone does it sort of thing</u>
<u n="259" who="S0390">well we didn't have <pause dur="short"/> oh mine was O level but we didn't have multiple choice it was all sort of writing but when I used to mark maths you had to give marks for getting so far through to the answer</u>
<u n="260" who="S0392">yeah yeah we get you get like on maths it's a bit better because you get method marks accuracy marks and result marks sort of thing</u>
<u n="261" who="S0390" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes uhu</u>
<u n="262" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="263" who="S0390">so you know you could get the wrong answer but you could get two or three marks</u>
<u n="264" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah easy <pause dur="short"/> you could get four out of five well maybe three out of five</u>
<u n="265" who="S0390" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah three out of five sounds more like it</u>
<u n="266" who="S0392">it's about the way you do it isn't it it's a bit like physics as well that out of all the sciences at this level physics is probably the easiest because they just give you the equation and it's just about putting the numbers into it</u>
<u n="267" who="S0390">mm mm mm yes I understand</u>
<u n="268" who="S0392">whereas if you're learning all sorts of things the revision guides are handy though because they tell you everything in there</u>
<u n="269" who="S0390">the revision guides or guys?</u>
<u n="270" who="S0392">yeah the they're like guides it is like a little book A4 size and it just</u>
<u n="271" who="S0390" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> do the school give you those?</u>
<u n="272" who="S0392">we have to buy them for like three pound fifty or something</u>
<u n="273" who="S0390">well that's not bad that's money well spent</u>
<u n="274" who="S0392" trans="overlap">that's not too bad <pause dur="short"/> yeah because if you're not going to learn it in class and they don't really tell you exactly what you need to learn or anything physics do and chemistry do but somehow</u>
<u n="275" who="S0390">is it so far written down so that you can just rewrite it parrot fashion?</u>
<u n="276" who="S0392">how do you mean?</u>
<u n="277" who="S0390">well when I used to do exams especially with we got one on Greek and Turkish independence I think</u>
<u n="278" who="S0392">is that history?</u>
<u n="279" who="S0390">history yes and above my head when I'm thinking I can see my exercise book and I'm just writing the answers I'm just seeing it and copying down what I see in my mind</u>
<u n="280" who="S0392">really?</u>
<u n="281" who="S0390">yes and I can see when I turn over the page is that what you do?</u>
<u n="282" who="S0392">no not at all I erm</u>
<u n="283" who="S0390">different kind of do you remember things that you hear? cos I don't</u>
<u n="284" who="S0392">yeah I can remember anything I'm quite good with facts</u>
<u n="285" who="S0390">right I'm I see when it's written down it's it's not a good photographic memory but it's part of a photographic memory which it it helps at O level but it doesn't at A level you know you've got to start thinking</u>
<u n="286" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> I don't think it would help at O level now or GCSEs either to be honest the way it works there's a lot more sciences themselves have even tried to help you sort or engage with the question if you know what I mean so <pause dur="short"/> give your own opinion positives and negative things to an extent obviously the most of the questions are</u>
<u n="287" who="S0390" trans="overlap">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> well in that case if they're asking your opinion something you had read in the paper that day</u>
<u n="288" who="S0392">then it would get on that one yeah but on other ones if it was erm something I think it was something about statins or something <unclear/></u>
<u n="289" who="S0390" trans="overlap">it would it would <pause dur="short"/> oh right well yes that was facts they wanted</u>
<u n="290" who="S0392">give give two reasons why er some people don't want you to have them then they wanted to two hard facts and then I said that something about effectiveness that had come out in the news that morning that it wasn't too effective or something <pause dur="short"/> it was something <trunc>I</trunc><trunc>I</trunc>I don't really I can't remember really what it was</u>
<u n="291" who="S0390">right right <pause dur="short"/> do they tell you your results?</u>
<u n="292" who="S0392">yeah yeah you get told your results</u>
<u n="293" who="S0390">so you know</u>
<u n="294" who="S0392">what what do you mean?</u>
<u n="295" who="S0390">well how many marks you have got? how many percentages? you know if you've got a paper and it's going to count</u>
<u n="296" who="S0392">oh yeah all the papers you do those at the end of year eleven so</u>
<u n="297" who="S0390">yeah I know that but the things that you're doing now they count a certain percentage towards your final mark</u>
<u n="298" who="S0392">not on the papers and things that's only little essays that you write controlled assessments only they count</u>
<u n="299" who="S0390">okay</u>
<u n="300" who="S0392">we've only done about we've only done two things that count so far three things</u>
<u n="301" who="S0390" trans="overlap">well what were you telling me you got a hundred percent in? was it German?</u>
<u n="302" who="S0392">well I've got a hundred percent in everything so far</u>
<u n="303" who="S0390">oh dear I don't think I'd bother go back to school if I was you</u>
<u n="304" who="S0392"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> no so far we've done two English but I've only got the results for one of them a a German and a physics</u>
<u n="305" who="S0390">hang on what was the English? language or literature?</u>
<u n="306" who="S0392">er language but it was more like literature really what we're doing now is more like language and then the other one was literature so</u>
<u n="307" who="S0390">what is it? do you do a Shakespeare play?</u>
<u n="308" who="S0392">we've done a we've done that already you only do one</u>
<u n="309" who="S0390" trans="overlap">what was it?</u>
<u n="310" who="S0392">we did comparing Macbeth and Richard the third</u>

<u n="316" who="S0392">no that sounds that doesn't sound like what we're doing</u>
<u n="317" who="S0390">right so it's it's Richard the second I'm talking about because we had that for ours where you could there was there was you could choose and about six of us chose Richard the second and I think the other one was a sort of flowery</u>

<u n="356" who="S0392">yeah we're only allowed four sides er four to six sides most of us did six sides</u>
<u n="357" who="S0390">well I don't think that that's very fair because a smaller writer can get so much more</u>
<u n="358" who="S0392">ah no no  that that was a guideline it wasn't really size of writing sort of thing if you'd written big then she'd of understood if you've gone over a bit more it was words really as a guide</u>
