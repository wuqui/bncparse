<u n="1" who="S0607">damn we just missed that <anon type="place"/> how many miles I was like looking and going? oh Smith River Brookings Portland oh I missed it erm okay</u>
<u n="2" who="S0644">I can't believe we're seeing signs for Portland</u>
<u n="3" who="S0607">look at this this is really great this road <pause dur="short"/> this is accidentally more trees</u>
<u n="4" who="S0644">aren't we sort of coming back a little bit like where we were though? I thought we were sort of having to go back to where we were to get back on the motorway</u>
<u n="5" who="S0607">well it doesn't feel like that does it?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0644">dunno</u>
<u n="7" who="S0607">it feels a bit like we're on a totally different road I wonder if we're on the right road</u>
<u n="8" who="S0644">oh smell the trees</u>
<u n="9" who="S0607" trans="overlap">oh it must be because it said Portland</u>
<u n="10" who="S0644"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="11" who="S0607"><vocal desc="misc"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="12" who="S0644">so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="13" who="S0607">so</u>
<u n="14" who="S0644">tell me about this potential trip you might be going on in Wales</u>
<u n="15" who="S0607">okay so there are two strands to the dilemma er it's all wonderful I just have to work it out because I can I just say it's a whole topic how</u>
<u n="16" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0607">sometimes I organise everything all wrong and it's all a stress and it's</u>
<u n="18" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0607">my own fault</u>
<u n="20" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="21" who="S0607">you know when you're like why would I do that? like why did I organise to like go and babysit for two toddlers one day after we get back from America? you know that kind of thing er <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="22" who="S0644">I don't you don't really do you really do things like that? because it's</u>
<u n="23" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah in a rush</u>
<u n="24" who="S0644" trans="overlap">I I do think you sort of know</u>
<u n="25" who="S0607" trans="overlap">because of my own fault</u>
<u n="26" who="S0644">that you will not be up for things like that</u>
<u n="27" who="S0607">well that's kind of like a dumb example but I do end up in situations</u>
<u n="28" who="S0644" trans="overlap">I know what you're saying though</u>
<u n="29" who="S0607">where I'm like <trunc>ha</trunc> why did I not realise that wouldn't wanna do this?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0607">erm and now it's my own fault</u>
<u n="32" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0607" trans="overlap">and I can't not do it</u>
<u n="34" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0607">erm so there's two strands quite hard to remain in the normal like speech mode <unclear>after America</unclear></u>
<u n="36" who="S0644" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="37" who="S0607">erm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="38" who="S0644">it is hard</u>
<u n="39" who="S0607">it is hard cos it makes everything <unclear/></u>
<u n="40" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I see what you</u>
<u n="41" who="S0607">oh <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="42" who="S0644">it does</u>
<u n="43" who="S0607">by the way this road is so fabulous</u>
<u n="44" who="S0644">it's good innit?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0607">erm so on the one hand <pause dur="short"/> there's three strands actually I know it's gonna get excruciatingly boring</u>
<u n="46" who="S0644">it's alright</u>
<u n="47" who="S0607">so the first thing is Denmark so wanna go to Denmark do the erm <pause dur="short"/> volunteering I was gonna go in July or August preferably August <pause dur="short"/> erm now the one the best one is now of course booked for July and August</u>
<u n="48" who="S0644">of course</u>
<u n="49" who="S0607">now I know it's complicated but so there's two things one is desperately wanna go for that one so I'm gonna have to go another month or find a different one that might not be as good people</u>
<u n="50" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="51" who="S0607">and the others problem with that is that I know it's complicated and annoying but not sure I wanna do it in September because what if I do end up deciding to go and do that writing course in Cornwall? it starts in September and that's one of those things that you don't wanna do to yourself</u>
<u n="52" who="S0644">is it the masters?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0607">yeah which we don't know if I'm gonna do that that's a whole other topic like what will I do about writing?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0607" trans="overlap">whether I'll just write or do a smaller course all that that's the biggest course</u>
<u n="56" who="S0644">right right</u>
<u n="57" who="S0607">so if I wanted to do that I I would wanna be preparing for that because it would start like third week of September and I don't wanna be in Denmark then so I think September is out which leaves going in May or June to Denmark to the people who are still the <trunc>b</trunc> so the people who are the best people</u>
<u n="58" who="S0644">uhu</u>
<u n="59" who="S0607">can you believe that these are the only options left? erm or going to someone else</u>
<u n="60" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0607">and sticking with the month that I wanted now I do tend to get glued to to an idea and think that nothing else can be right</u>
<u n="62" who="S0644">yes</u>
<u n="63" who="S0607">so you know I wanted those people</u>
<u n="64" who="S0644" trans="overlap">and it could be an exercise in flexibility and adaptability</u>
<u n="65" who="S0607">yeah if I want to choose someone else I should possibly even though we're away and it's annoying like next time I'm laid in bed with wi-fi I should possibly check out the other people because they might also get booked up I think my favourite people <unclear>have got picked up</unclear> cos they sound so fabulous erm so maybe it is best with the with the Denmark thing because I don't really okay so there's June there's June right?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0607" trans="overlap">that's not too bad</u>
<u n="68" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="69" who="S0607">but just to explain the logic I kind of wanted to like fixate on the house-sitting until like maybe mid-July</u>
<u n="70" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0607">and then in the summer I wanted to be either by the sea a bit by the sea so either if there's a house in Cornwall or even like living at my mum and dad's because it's by the sea and hanging out</u>
<u n="72" who="S0644" trans="overlap">uhu mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0607" trans="overlap">and like going to the beach and stuff</u>
<u n="74" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0607">or being hang on one nine seven</u>
<u n="76" who="S0644">er?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0607">oh is it just a junction? <unclear>one nine seven</unclear> erm I just wanted to do the house-sitting thing until like June Julyish and then have the summer like volunteering or beach stuff</u>
<u n="78" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0607">I didn't really want volunteering to start already at the beginning of June but maybe that's too rigid because what I could do is no you see I just feel like it's too <trunc>ear</trunc> cos I was thinking I was gonna maybe do a month in Denmark do two weeks at the caf√© and two weeks on a farm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="81" who="S0607">erm so</u>
<u n="82" who="S0644">would that</u>
<u n="83" who="S0607">it's</u>
<u n="84" who="S0644" trans="overlap">coincide?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0607">well you see if I wanted to do the <trunc>peo</trunc> if I was still fixated on the people that I wanted</u>
<u n="86" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0607">erm <pause dur="short"/> then I'd have to try and cos the it looks like in June they've got one place left so I'd have I'd have to like that's when the Wales thing comes into play so Wales is the twentieth till the twenty-ninth of June so I'd have to go to Denmark either only for three weeks like the first bit of June come back and go straight to Wales or set off to Denmark in May like the last week of May but then it's getting too soon and I know it sounds fussy but you know you've been saying like how you just know stuff?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="89" who="S0607">I feel like May is too soon I don't wanna already be going to Denmark in May <pause dur="short"/> it's just what I don't want I just wanna just want there to be several months stretching off into the distance so potentially house-sitting or you know being a floater</u>
<u n="90" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0607">erm so just floating around and like I'm not I'm trying not to say the word bum but you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0607">so I just don't wanna go</u>
<u n="94" who="S0644">dosser</u>
<u n="95" who="S0607">oh I'm gonna have to go May because there's Wales and then <vocal desc="misc"/> so maybe what I should do is maybe er I have talked myself into the answer which is</u>
<u n="96" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0607">do the Wales thing because I did wanna go to Wales and it's June so that and it's near the sea</u>
<u n="98" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0607">and then pick another Denmark er volunteering for July or August do you think?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0644" trans="overlap">or what oh yeah and you can't do September cos it might be they <trunc>g</trunc></u>
<u n="101" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0644">but the September <trunc>op</trunc> yeah you don't wanna mess them about I was gonna say could book <unclear/> and then if you change your mind about the course do that but er you don't wanna mess them about so yeah I would just do as little as possible really</u>
<u n="103" who="S0607">and also er sorry it's boring but</u>
<u n="104" who="S0644">no go on</u>
<u n="105" who="S0607" trans="overlap">also <pause dur="short"/> oh man oh man</u>
<u n="106" who="S0644">oh man <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="107" who="S0607">that was one of those where I wasn't really sure how near I was do you know did you feel near?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0644">erm that's the nearest I've felt to anything on this road cos</u>
<u n="109" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="110" who="S0644">it's so huge and like</u>
<u n="111" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and then the other thing is I've got this other disease going on which is like no it's not as strong as a disease but it's where things have been coming up for like July or August and I've been going yeah I just can't <trunc>con</trunc> I mean I just can't commit that far you know I just can't no no no no and it's because I've just got this feeling that I wanna be by the sea in July and August because and so for example a house-sit might come up in like there's been things coming up in like somewhere else</u>
<u n="112" who="S0644">mm mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0607">and I've thought no no and it and I think it's partly because of the whole like don't wanna book myself up</u>
<u n="114" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0607">because by the summer I might wanna float around</u>
<u n="116" who="S0644">yes</u>
<u n="117" who="S0607">do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0644" trans="overlap">now <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> this is what I was saying to you</u>
<u n="119" who="S0607" trans="overlap">but <unclear/></u>
<u n="120" who="S0644">erm let me just tell you what is your it's the habit you've got of being organised and booked and everything's organised and trying to fit everything in</u>
<u n="121" who="S0607">it's actually a <unclear>right</unclear> thing</u>
<u n="122" who="S0644" trans="overlap">it's a habit and you're it's but habits don't just die you have to work at it so you sort like are in limbo where you attempted to do all this booking and arranging and organising but really you know now that that don't work always for you</u>
<u n="123" who="S0607">oh I wanted to get down it didn't tell me I went down</u>
<u n="124" who="S0644">it did</u>
<u n="125" who="S0607" trans="overlap">anyway <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="126" who="S0644">didn't it? to forty-five? erm don't you love these trucks?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0644" trans="overlap">the <unclear>cab cars</unclear> so yeah I just think at least you're finally paying attention to yourself</u>
<u n="129" who="S0607">yes</u>
<u n="130" who="S0644">by saying actually I don't really wanna book everything four months five months six months in advance</u>
<u n="131" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="132" who="S0644">cos it might not work like that can I just give you an example? sorry to have to interject</u>
<u n="133" who="S0607">no it's brilliant</u>
<u n="134" who="S0644" trans="overlap">I mean then I'll let you get back so I dunno if you remember I used to be a lot more like that as in erm I've just gotta go here and I've just gotta do this and then I'm gonna do this and then I do this and then I go there and then I'm gonna do this</u>
<u n="135" who="S0607"><trunc>ye</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="136" who="S0644" trans="overlap">and I don't do that at all any more or</u>
<u n="137" who="S0607" trans="overlap">oh really?</u>
<u n="138" who="S0644">yeah and it's</u>
<u n="139" who="S0607" trans="overlap"><trunc>becau</trunc></u>
<u n="140" who="S0644">it's really good</u>
<u n="141" who="S0607" trans="overlap">do you mean you don't plan it?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0644">no I mean even in the space of a weekend I'd I'd be talking to somebody and I'd go oh I'll pop in and see you on the way back and then I'd say well I'm just gonna go and see so and so as well on the way back cos I said no reason like I just said I'd I'd do all these things it was silly <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="143" who="S0607">go on dude go on go on <pause dur="short"/> and they don't go past when you're trying to get them to go past</u>
<u n="144" who="S0644">they can see what you're trying to do surely</u>
<u n="145" who="S0607">I didn't wanna go over that line either but we did okay anyway yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0644">just just for example erm say not so much last year but the year when I was going out with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> so and I I'd got involved I used to not help <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> a lot but one I there were times when she needed some help and I was trying to do what I could erm so I'd say yeah but I'll I'll give you a lift here or I'll do this and I'd be trying to see <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I'd try and do aunt <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s at the weekend and I'd be at work and I'd wanna go and see my mum and I'd wanna go and see my dad and I'd wanna see whoever</u>
<u n="147" who="S0607">oh man it's so stressful</u>
<u n="148" who="S0644" trans="overlap">and then there was somehow I got involved and there was this this animal sanctuary it's a whole different topic and I got involved in helping them out a little bit</u>
<u n="149" who="S0607">you're helping too many people</u>
<u n="150" who="S0644">it <trunc>wa</trunc> in the end it was <unclear/></u>
<u n="151" who="S0607" trans="overlap">for you <unclear/></u>
<u n="152" who="S0644" trans="overlap">there <trunc>w</trunc> no spare time</u>
<u n="153" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0644">at all now I don't do anything</u>
<u n="155" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0644">because it slowly dropped er</u>
<u n="157" who="S0607">they can all just go and</u>
<u n="158" who="S0644" trans="overlap">it all just went</u>
<u n="159" who="S0607">they can all just go and like suffer and struggle alone</u>
<u n="160" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="161" who="S0607">no but it's true like you can't help so many many people</u>
<u n="162" who="S0644" trans="overlap">but it crept up it crept up</u>
<u n="163" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0644">but slowly slowly slowly things were dropping off and now I've realised I actually don't have anything to do a lot of the time and it's really good but whereas I would have filled it up before with stuff</u>
<u n="165" who="S0607" trans="overlap">but also you were totally obligated then cos you'd like arranged to help people</u>
<u n="166" who="S0644">well each of the things and they they still are each of the things were things that I could never really not do like my aunt <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s shopping and help with my aunt <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I have to do that erm the animal people I felt really bad about that cos if I wasn't doing it then who was <trunc>help</trunc>? that's a whole other topic I won't get into it erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> of course I wanted to help her where I could do like cos she couldn't drive the last</u>
<u n="167" who="S0607">ah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0644" trans="overlap">six months</u>
<u n="169" who="S0607">okay</u>
<u n="170" who="S0644">she wasn't allowed to drive cos she was she was ill so not that I did a lot by any stretch but I used to occasionally give her a lift and get</u>
<u n="171" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0644">get something for her or do whatever erm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0607">oh so</u>
<u n="174" who="S0644" trans="overlap">and it was constant though</u>
<u n="175" who="S0607" trans="overlap">so good</u>
<u n="176" who="S0644">it was but I'm not complaining obviously I'm just saying how if you've got this you're like a magnet right? and if you it just attracts some more so if you've already got this momentum going on this is the theory of everything if you've already got this momentum going on where you're looking for things to do helping people out trying to help here trying to do this trying to do this and your thing is organising innit and booking and trying to fit in as much and</u>
<u n="177" who="S0607" trans="overlap">and researching to the nth degree like</u>
<u n="178" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="179" who="S0607">any potential like anything check it</u>
<u n="180" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0607">you know how I said to you one day <vocal desc="laugh"/> oh I've just remembered there's no reception on this stretch of the highway <vocal desc="laugh"/> and you were like</u>
<u n="182" who="S0644">well I heard it but I couldn't believe I'd heard it</u>
<u n="183" who="S0607">oh my goodness is that a hotel? no</u>
<u n="184" who="S0644" trans="overlap">it's a museum</u>
<u n="185" who="S0607">it's a museum</u>
<u n="186" who="S0644">still pretty good innit?</u>
<u n="187" who="S0607">but is there a is there a hotel that's a <unclear>boat</unclear>?</u>

<u n="300" who="S0644">erm</u>
<u n="301" who="S0607">or or just try and explain it again otherwise</u>
<u n="302" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/> right <pause dur="short"/> so there's this <pause dur="short"/> imagine you looking in the mirror right?</u>
<u n="303" who="S0607">that's bad</u>

<u n="309" who="S0607">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="310" who="S0644">and you have in your er experience of going through life they'll call it contrast right? so the contrast choose gets you to decide what you do like so there's the something so for example erm Frankfurt very erm fast paced hardworking conformist and the experience of that has not made you go yes I'm gonna be hardworking driven conformist work as hard as I possibly can for as many hours as I possibly</u>
<u n="311" who="S0607" trans="overlap">I don't I don't want that</u>
<u n="312" who="S0644">it's gone I don't like this now if you had gone straightaway</u>
<u n="313" who="S0607" trans="overlap">that's the busy part of you</u>
<u n="314" who="S0644">yeah cos you're the one that's having the the experience now so as soon as you've gone I don't like this <pause dur="short"/> the non-physical you goes what I do like is to be more relaxed I like to be more</u>
<u n="315" who="S0607" trans="overlap">ah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="316" who="S0644" trans="overlap">erm enjoying everything not feeling so under pressure and it becomes that straightaway now if you decide to to do that as well then you you can do that</u>
<u n="317" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="318" who="S0644">but erm what often happens what we often do is instead of just going yeah I'm not gonna do that anymore I'm gonna do this we go concentrate on the I don't like it here it's really it's not me it's horrible here I'm not enjoying myself I'm not enjoying myself it's really awful I don't like it what am I gonna do? and then it's just gonna get worse and it's just gonna get worse and it's just gonna get worse</u>
<u n="319" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="320" who="S0644">now this sounds very simple doesn't it? and</u>
<u n="321" who="S0607" trans="overlap">and that which which you is that doing that?</u>
<u n="322" who="S0644">that's the physical you erm <pause dur="short"/> but occasionally and depending on what type of thoughts you what type of person or thought patterns you're used to having some people just go bollocks don't like this I'm off</u>
<u n="323" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="324" who="S0644">and and they'll not worry about it but then a different person not using you as an example but another type of person might go well I've got this fantastic job and I really ought to stay because that's what everyone else tells me I should do and everyone says that you've gotta the more money you're earning the better off you are and the the harder you're working the more money you're gonna earn and then it's it's just the way life is it's just how it is but another person might go well no er I'm gonna do what I like I can do whatever I want to it's my life and I can I can change it if I want to</u>
<u n="325" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="326" who="S0644">so basically that's the spectrum</u>
<u n="327" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="328" who="S0644">that you're talking about and there's the you and if you're a negative person then that person is always gonna veer upon the negative it's it's so interesting and it's so hugely massive I can't tell you all the examples in one go anyway if it's launched into a monologue so we're now gonna go back to your thing but I I get it what you're saying about the whole</u>
<u n="329" who="S0607" trans="overlap">what was my thing?</u>
<u n="330" who="S0644" trans="overlap">spectrum of of I can be a bit like this or I can be less like this</u>
<u n="331" who="S0607" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="332" who="S0644">but the the moral of the story of that was if you don't like something you can completely change it</u>
<u n="333" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="334" who="S0644">and the thing that says you can't that's your personality it's wrong it's not  your personality if it makes you not happy</u>
<u n="335" who="S0607">but do you think that it it's actually possible for me to become an Along Came Polly?</u>
<u n="336" who="S0644">yes it's neurological linguistic programming is the technical term <pause dur="short"/> you really could <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> if you had like a few weeks with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she could change your thinking</u>
<u n="337" who="S0607">I think it might take longer than two weeks</u>
<u n="338" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="339" who="S0607">but I do think that I can you know I keep reading that As You Think which I got because of you because you had a book that told you what book to get and erm it all makes total sense and then I don't do it I'm like</u>
<u n="340" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="341" who="S0607">right I'm gonna do it I'm gonna think differently why why on earth would I not be?</u>
<u n="342" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah yeah and then it goes back to normal that's cos it's a habit habits are not difficult they're not easy things to change that's why they're called habits innit? they're you have to work at it but eventually it does become</u>
<u n="343" who="S0607">maybe this house-sitting thing will be good because you're I'm forced to like be on my own and and work stuff out erm</u>
<u n="344" who="S0644" trans="overlap">I think it's completely what you need it's the opposite of erm what you've been doing</u>
<u n="345" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="346" who="S0644">innit? so it's it is what you need</u>
<u n="347" who="S0607">because erm for example when I was at that <unclear>camping thing</unclear> <vocal desc="yawn"/> erm and I was telling you how I <trunc>di</trunc> like was walking along the beach</u>

<u n="508" who="S0644" trans="overlap">if if I really run out of something I'll have to I'll have to find <trunc>s</trunc> there's always we're not really going to the proper outback are we? like if I have to buy some more knickers I can buy some more knickers</u>
<u n="509" who="S0607">mm</u>

<u n="588" who="S0644">uhu mm</u>
<u n="589" who="S0607">but we were doing clothes</u>

<u n="604" who="S0644">brilliant brilliant brilliant</u>
<u n="605" who="S0607">and I chucked out you won't believe it cos I can't believe I had this much stuff I chucked out like five bin liners of clothes right?</u>

<u n="632" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="633" who="S0607">and I think it would be a mistake cos my mum said don't chuck away stuff that you're gonna have to buy again cos that's a waste of money</u>
<u n="634" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="635" who="S0607">so like a basket that you're gonna put things in in this fictional apartment or you know er loads of cables that do long</u>

<u n="642" who="S0644">oh look</u>
<u n="643" who="S0607">but what do you think? cos I'm thinking I'm gonna reduce my stuff and I've got I've I'm not gonna be working right? so I'm gonna go into the attic</u>
<u n="644" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="645" who="S0607">and I'm gonna start with the stuff that was already in the attic before I arrived</u>
<u n="646" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="647" who="S0607">and I'm gonna get rid of all and I want to get rid of eighty percent of it because do you know what <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="648" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="649" who="S0607">I don't want loads of physical reminders of memories</u>
