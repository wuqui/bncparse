<u n="699" who="S0041">then you don't  you don't  care <pause dur="short"/> and that really makes people feel disposable</u>
<u n="700" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="701" who="S0041">and I think before Christmas especially because then we took on agency staff</u>
<u n="702" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="704" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="705" who="S0041">people weren't having personal development <pause dur="short"/> they weren't recognized <pause dur="short"/> and they just felt they were disposable <pause dur="short"/> and I think it that goes to proving how many <trunc>sta</trunc> how much staff you lost at that time</u>

<u n="722" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="723" who="S0041">um and I know she had a conversation about becoming supervisor <pause dur="short"/> and that was basically a proviso of whether she could stay <pause dur="short"/> cos she felt disposable</u>
<u n="724" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="725" who="S0041">I said where's  now? He said I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I said America</u>

<u n="731" who="S0041">isn't it</u>
<u n="732" who="S0084">Cos my group director Geoff of our group the he's probably responsible obviously er it cascades down but he's probably responsible for seventy people including the US <pause dur="short"/> and he knows everybody  he knows everybody</u>
<u n="733" who="S0041">you should <pause dur="short"/> that's</u>
<u n="734" who="S0084">on the team</u>

<u n="737" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="738" who="S0084">and but you've gotta trust that their line manager's cos you're responsible for hiring your next in charge</u>

<u n="741" who="S0041">they're doing that <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="742" who="S0084">but he's obviously not taking any active interest in his staff <pause dur="short"/> otherwise he would be pulling up on</u>
<u n="743" who="S0041">not at all</u>
<u n="744" who="S0084">so does <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> report to him?</u>
