<u n="1414" who="S0493">it's a word one</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0666">yeah</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0493">easy enough <trunc>s</trunc> into teams <pause dur="short"/> and you get ah just wait you get a good five <pause dur="short"/> by five different words so they'll I think what's five by five? twenty isn't it?</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0492">twenty-five</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0666" trans="overlap">twenty-five</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0493">where are the games?</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0492">oh here</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0493">so you'd have twenty-five words on the table <pause dur="short"/> and they'll be just nouns <pause dur="short"/> and one team <pause dur="short"/> each team has a guy who knows what the <trunc>s</trunc> the words pertaining to their team are so eight of the names will be for the blue team eight of the cards will be for the red team eight of them will be neutral and like a few of them can end the game immediately and lose you the game <pause dur="short"/> so you get a grid and you'll know that the words tennis horse and bath er <trunc>y</trunc> the team that you want your teammates to guess those three words and you've gotta think of one word just to tell them that they'll go tennis relates to that word so does bath and so does cow <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> what could that be for example? tennis cow <pause dur="short"/> bath</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0666">what?</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0493" trans="overlap">there would be one <pause dur="short"/> I dunno but there would be one</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0492">I dunno</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0493" trans="overlap">I'll I'll it's I'll just I'll show you <pause dur="short"/> so mum if you wanna get <pause dur="short"/> wanna count out twenty-five <pause dur="long"/> okay? <pause dur="long"/> okay so for example on this if I looked at this grid <pause dur="short"/> right and I was the red team</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0493" trans="overlap">I knew that this card this card this card would be red I knew these ones would be blue and if I give a clue where my red team accidentally go for a blue one they're given a point to the other team so for example they and <unclear/> if they were both read and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and dad were on my team I <trunc>kn</trunc> I know that these red cards are the ones I want them to go for cos we're the red team so I would say</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0666">how do you know the what do you mean you know that they're red?</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0493">cos this grid tells me</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0666">oh okay</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0493" trans="overlap">so I would say knight a knight of armour <trunc>wa</trunc> er is a suit and day is the opposite of night so I would say night and hope that dad and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> would get would would say</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0666">yeah</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0493">I would say night two and they know that there are two cards out there pertain to night</u>
<u n="1434" who="S0666" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="1435" who="S0493">they would say suit and day however if there was something else that I hadn't seen <pause dur="short"/> if there was a word out there that I hadn't seen that also pertained to knight</u>
<u n="1436" who="S0666">yeah</u>
<u n="1437" who="S0493">they could accidently or go yeah a suit right a knight wears a suit but I didn't think about the connection between knight and <unclear/> for argument's sake they could choose this and that one accidentally loses a point or possibly end the game</u>
<u n="1438" who="S0666">yeah</u>
<u n="1439" who="S0493">so basically you're gonna have a list of the one player on each team will see that there's this is the five by five grid and they'll know if you're looking at it from this way that this is red this is red this is red but these two are two this is neutral so if you do this by mistake</u>
<u n="1440" who="S0666">mm</u>
<u n="1441" who="S0493" trans="overlap">you haven't got a point but then you haven't lost the point</u>
<u n="1442" who="S0666">mm</u>
<u n="1443" who="S0493">this is neutral this is neutral this is red this is red and this black one is if any player from any team chooses <trunc>t</trunc> the word table at any time you automatically lose the game so if I wanted to give the clue leg for octopus that would be a good clue if I was on the blue team</u>
<u n="1444" who="S0666" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1445" who="S0493" trans="overlap">but obviously you might go right yeah table leg I'll <trunc>ch</trunc> I'll go table no I'll go leg two <pause dur="short"/> you choose octopus and table and you'd lose the game and so whoever's given the clues we need to be conscious of the fact they don't wanna give</u>
<u n="1446" who="S0666">mm</u>
<u n="1447" who="S0493" trans="overlap">that one away</u>
<u n="1448" who="S0666">mm okay</u>
<u n="1449" who="S0493">any questions?</u>
<u n="1450" who="S0492">how do you make sure you get those cards the right way round?</u>
<u n="1451" who="S0493">erm you've just gotta remember so there's a little stand that you can just put it on</u>
<u n="1452" who="S0492">okay</u>
<u n="1453" who="S0493" trans="overlap">and it will be in front of you but because there's five which is a bit of a weird number and I have I've only played this once before it's up to you you're <trunc>ei</trunc> you're either better off having one player who's neutral and then giving clues to the blue team and the red team <pause dur="short"/> or</u>
<u n="1454" who="S0605" trans="overlap">that's easier isn't it?</u>
<u n="1455" who="S0493">yeah</u>
<u n="1456" who="S0604">right yeah I'll do it</u>
<u n="1457" who="S0493">yeah?</u>
<u n="1458" who="S0604">uhu</u>
<u n="1459" who="S0493">okay <pause dur="short"/> so if you take that <pause dur="short"/> then do you want it to be you and dad together?</u>
<u n="1460" who="S0666" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="1461" who="S0493">okay so one of do you wanna be the blue or the reds?</u>
<u n="1462" who="S0605">blue</u>
<u n="1463" who="S0493">okay so if mum and dad go first you're the blue team</u>
<u n="1464" who="S0666">uhu</u>
<u n="1465" who="S0493">but cos you're going first <pause dur="short"/> you've got it slightly harder you've gotta get one two three four you've gotta put nine cards over to win the game you've gotta get nine points</u>
<u n="1466" who="S0666">okay</u>
<u n="1467" who="S0493">by getting a point if <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> says like is said table er leg two and he was correct you'd put a blue point there a blue point there when you do that nine times</u>
<u n="1468" who="S0666">uhu</u>
<u n="1469" who="S0493">you've won the game we've gotta do it eight times cos we're not going first</u>
<u n="1470" who="S0666">okay</u>
<u n="1471" who="S0493">if you say <pause dur="short"/> a a word that isn't blue but it's red then even though it's your turn we put the red card on according to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s grid if it happens to be neutral then you just put a neutral character on there</u>
<u n="1472" who="S0666">okay</u>
<u n="1473" who="S0493">but again there's one black card</u>
<u n="1474" who="S0666">uhu</u>
<u n="1475" who="S0493">which is the assassin so if anyone there's gonna be one of these cards now which is</u>
<u n="1476" who="S0666" trans="overlap">for the assassin?</u>
<u n="1477" who="S0493">yeah and</u>
<u n="1478" who="S0666" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1479" who="S0493">that will go on there then</u>
<u n="1480" who="S0492">and does is it <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> that puts the the colours on?</u>
<u n="1481" who="S0493">when we're right or wrong?</u>
<u n="1482" who="S0492">yeah</u>
<u n="1483" who="S0493">so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will say a clue like <pause dur="short"/> festival three or festival one or festival two the number tells you how many cards there are</u>
<u n="1484" who="S0492">uhu</u>
<u n="1485" who="S0493" trans="overlap">that pertain to that clue <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will say festival two then you will openly talk about it</u>
<u n="1486" who="S0492">right</u>
<u n="1487" who="S0493">and we'll say which one do you think it is? okay we think it's circle and shoe and when we touch them that means we're locked in and he will go we will put either according his grid either the red card</u>
<u n="1488" who="S0492" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="1489" who="S0493">which we won the blue card the neutral card or the assassin card</u>
<u n="1490" who="S0492" trans="overlap">okay yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1491" who="S0493">mum and dad need to be listening to what we're saying as well because you'll get clues from what we're saying and you'll know if if <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> says <pause dur="short"/> tentacle and for some reason we missed octopus you will know that you are not looking for octopus because octopus is a blue card</u>
<u n="1492" who="S0666">oh okay</u>
<u n="1493" who="S0493" trans="overlap">right?</u>
<u n="1494" who="S0666">okay so he's gonna yeah okay</u>
<u n="1495" who="S0493">so if your first two or three</u>
<u n="1496" who="S0666" trans="overlap">so he's gonna give clues yeah</u>
<u n="1497" who="S0493">but really you're doing well you'll will be doing really well if you can get three cards that are all blue</u>
<u n="1498" who="S0492" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1499" who="S0493">that can all be linked by one word</u>
<u n="1500" who="S0666">yeah</u>
<u n="1501" who="S0493">so you can't use a foreign word you can't use an accent</u>
<u n="1502" who="S0604">okay</u>
