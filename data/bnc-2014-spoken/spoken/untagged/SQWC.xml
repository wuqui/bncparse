<u n="14" who="S0041">how did that come about then? Did he come around?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> We were talking last night <pause dur="short"/> and he was he'd <trunc>go</trunc> had some sort of drama <pause dur="short"/> obviously <pause dur="short"/> cos his middle name's drama</u>

I said free during the day <pause dur="short"/> cos I was supposed to go and see Hannah but <trunc>sh</trunc> but of course cancelled again <pause dur="short"/> third time is the charm <pause dur="short"/> might see her next week</u>
<u n="20" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

So I thought I'll just I do wanna see him <pause dur="short"/> cos I wanna clear the air <pause dur="short"/> and I wanna make sure everything's alright <pause dur="short"/> and then I'll you know I've been <unclear/> sort of calm about the whole thing <pause dur="short"/> he said yeah sounds brilliant <pause dur="short"/> and then this morning I was sort of lazing around in bed thinking I probably should get up at some point <pause dur="short"/> at half eleven <pause dur="short"/> thinking oh he'll probably just cancel cos er or he'll forget</u>
<u n="22" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> But he texted in the morning saying what time's lunch? So <trunc>quar</trunc> <trunc>pr</trunc> probably should get up now</u>

<u n="25" who="S0084">like quarter to twelve <pause dur="short"/> probably should wash myself <pause dur="short"/> so he came over <pause dur="short"/> I didn't cook lunch <pause dur="short"/> couldn't be bothered <pause dur="short"/> oh well my plan was to make soup and he could've had which I have now done <pause dur="short"/> and he could've had soup <pause dur="short"/> but it was really hot <pause dur="short"/> like it was too hot to make soup even <pause dur="short"/> in the house <pause dur="short"/> so that's when we went out to the pub <pause dur="short"/> and er it was fine actually <pause dur="short"/> it was really nice <pause dur="short"/> I had a little talk eventually <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and I just said look can we not make this into too much of a drama <pause dur="short"/> can we just you know <trunc>wha</trunc> do you wanna  do you wanna  just see what happens? Or? You know cos he obviously sent me that message saying oh I I think we should stop seeing each other</u>
<u n="26" who="S0041">yeah</u>

<u n="32" who="S0041">negating said message</u>
<u n="33" who="S0084">so yeah <pause dur="short"/> hmm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> And from what he tells me I don't think he's got anybody else in his life who he's could particularly talk to about stuff <pause dur="short"/> so even if it's just that you're a bit of a saddo <pause dur="short"/> because that's what annoys me <pause dur="short"/> it's that it's not just a a shagging</u>
<u n="34" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0084">situation</u>
<u n="36" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0084">there is more to it <pause dur="short"/> which is I think is where that's gonna get confused <pause dur="short"/> that line is already a bit blurred</u>
<u n="38" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="39" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> but then at the same time it's quite nice to have a bit of chat and a bit of banter <pause dur="short"/> and know that you get on <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> that it's not just</u>
<u n="40" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0084">a a shag thing <pause dur="short"/> but we've both agreed that <vocal desc="cough"/> for me he's mental <pause dur="short"/> like as much fun as he is he's not</u>

<u n="44" who="S0041">right <pause dur="short"/> mhm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0084">well <pause dur="short"/> not quite as callously as that <pause dur="short"/> I did just say</u>
<u n="46" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0084">I did just say you've got quite a lot going wrong in your life <pause dur="short"/> you you know you are pro-drama <pause dur="short"/> he was like yeah well not through choice <pause dur="short"/> and I said no I appreciate that but you you have got a lot of stuff going on <pause dur="short"/> it's like a really big year for you <pause dur="short"/> and um I can't get embroiled in that <pause dur="short"/> and you need to just sort of concentrate on what's going on <pause dur="short"/> and I know that that's what you think <pause dur="short"/> and he said yeah <pause dur="short"/> so we're both sort of on the same page about it</u>
<u n="48" who="S0041">ah <pause dur="short"/> that's good</u>
<u n="49" who="S0084">I think if it gets to a point where it's too much for either of us we'll just have to walk away</u>
<u n="50" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">for now we have er quite a giggle</u>

<u n="53" who="S0084">so <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="54" who="S0041">definitely sounds like a good plan</u>
<u n="55" who="S0084">I mean it it sounds like it's really good <pause dur="short"/> and everyone is you know on board with it</u>
<u n="56" who="S0041">on yeah</u>
