<u n="22" who="S0589">it's high tide again</u>
<u n="23" who="S0588">look it's the same time as yesterday</u>

<u n="27" who="S0588">well thing is if I had the clip-on microphone I wouldn't have to hold this</u>

<u n="35" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it doesn't no <pause dur="short"/> if we want to go to <anon type="place"/> we'll have to catch that ferry <vocal desc="laugh"/> but I think getting the ferry would be quite fun but where you actually end up?

<u n="36" who="S0589" trans="overlap">nothing just that</u>

<u n="38" who="S0589">those three blocks and the <anon type="place"/> factory</u>
<u n="39" who="S0588">yeah but then then <pause dur="short"/> but then if you wanted to er anything along the Thames that side that's what we would do otherwise there's no other way of getting across a bit like when we nearly ended up</u>
<u n="40" who="S0589" trans="overlap">the <anon type="place"/> darling</u>
<u n="41" who="S0588">in north <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="42" who="S0589">yeah that's what we would have had to actually</u>
<u n="43" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah the thing is I would have thought that yeah we would have had to get the <anon type="place"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="44" who="S0589">no but we would have got the er the the the ferry</u>
<u n="45" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="46" who="S0589" trans="overlap">the crossing the ferry</u>
<u n="47" who="S0588">but er which wouldn't have been that bad but a bit erm <trunc>un</trunc>unexpected but if I hadn't been with you I would have thought oh it's <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="48" who="S0589">ah yes you would have</u>
<u n="49" who="S0588" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="53" who="S0588" trans="overlap">well I didn't know there was a big difference <pause dur="short"/> but then you don't until a <trunc>lo</trunc> you've been somewhere for a long time I didn't know <anon type="place"/> for ages and ages</u>
<u n="54" who="S0589" trans="overlap">it would be quite funny if the the bus did get on the ferry and took as across</u>
<u n="55" who="S0588"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0589"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="58" who="S0589" trans="overlap">erm well the bit towards</u>
<u n="59" who="S0588">and it gradually seeps into your consciousness doesn't it?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0589" trans="overlap">the bit towards erm <anon type="place"/> we never really explored much</u>
<u n="61" who="S0588">and we had just started to really</u>

<u n="63" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah there wasn't really anything there</u>
<u n="64" who="S0589">well two thousand and twelve I suppose</u>
<u n="65" who="S0588">it's true</u>
<u n="66" who="S0589">but I would have gone a lot of times</u>

<u n="68" who="S0589">to the <anon type="place"/> brewery where do you remember we had that lovely</u>

<u n="98" who="S0589">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0588">but not ideal because it's nice to have a bit of a life but the thing about working full time like that is it just you don't really get one</u>
<u n="100" who="S0589" trans="overlap">and then then we became briefly wealthy</u>
<u n="101" who="S0588"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="136" who="S0589" trans="overlap">is there a swimming pool through there too?</u>
<u n="137" who="S0588">the crucial thing is having a nice <pause dur="short"/> a nice route to wherever you're going because what's I find so off putting is for example seeing this leisure centre along that busy road I have not wanted to go</u>
<u n="138" who="S0589">look there's another pool</u>
