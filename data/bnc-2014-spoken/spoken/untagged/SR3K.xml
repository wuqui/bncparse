<u n="552" who="S0493" trans="overlap">don't you <unclear>Stokes Croft</unclear> again</u>
<u n="553" who="S0603" trans="overlap">yeah er level four so okay so that's level two and three so you get two levels</u>
<u n="554" who="S0604">yeah</u>
<u n="555" who="S0603" trans="overlap">with of rioting so level four is collapsing</u>
<u n="556" who="S0604">so what that says what? discard one card the city's colour to drive into it at all</u>
<u n="557" who="S0603">discard one card</u>
<u n="558" who="S0493">to move into it</u>
<u n="559" who="S0603" trans="overlap">of of <unclear/></u>
<u n="560" who="S0604" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="561" who="S0603" trans="overlap">you need to discard a</u>
<u n="562" who="S0604">wow</u>
<u n="563" who="S0603">so you've gotta get rid of a card to get there</u>
<u n="564" who="S0493">to either drive to to to drive into it to walk into it</u>
<u n="565" who="S0603">to get there yeah</u>
<u n="566" who="S0493" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="567" who="S0603" trans="overlap">or yeah anything er</u>
<u n="568" who="S0604" trans="overlap">so you probably just go around it or</u>
<u n="569" who="S0603">that will be it would slow you down yeah</u>
<u n="570" who="S0493" trans="overlap">well you that's er if it's got three because it will have three cos it's an outbreak</u>
<u n="571" who="S0604">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay?</u>
<u n="572" who="S0493" trans="overlap">that's amazing</u>
<u n="573" who="S0603">so each time a city's a <trunc>pa</trunc> whenever an outbreak occurs in a city</u>
<u n="574" who="S0605">don't worry about it</u>
<u n="575" who="S0603" trans="overlap">its panic level will go up by one so yeah basically as soon as there's an outbreak you go up one</u>
<u n="576" who="S0493">yeah</u>
<u n="577" who="S0603" trans="overlap">so in one game it's quite <trunc>com</trunc> it's quite you know</u>
<u n="578" who="S0493" trans="overlap">so you really don't want outbreaks more so than usual</u>
<u n="579" who="S0603">that like Baghdad if you <trunc>ge</trunc> you get two outbreaks in Baghdad you</u>
<u n="580" who="S0493">yeah</u>
<u n="581" who="S0604" trans="overlap">yeah so what we were saying dad er the cities have panic levels now yeah good idea so these have panic levels now that erm if people start rioting so if there's an outbreak er more than more than</u>
<u n="582" who="S0493" trans="overlap">three</u>
<u n="583" who="S0604" trans="overlap">once</u>
<u n="584" who="S0493">more than three cubes on a city</u>

<u n="589" who="S0603" trans="overlap">yeah I don't know what the civs do yet but</u>
<u n="590" who="S0604">so that means you know once they if there's more than two outbreaks that means you know there are three cubes on there more than er two times you can't get in or out no direct flights and you can't try to charter one in or out and you can't all the research stations there are destroyed and you can't <unclear/> so if there's</u>
<u n="591" who="S0605">very realistic actually that's</u>
<u n="592" who="S0604" trans="overlap">yeah it's good</u>
<u n="593" who="S0605" trans="overlap">you know in</u>
<u n="594" who="S0493" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="983" who="S0604" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="984" who="S0603" trans="overlap">move anywhere but I think one quiet night is really helpful</u>
