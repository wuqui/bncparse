<u n="80" who="S0655">because of you?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0653">mm I guess so</u>
<u n="82" who="S0655">I would think so too</u>
<u n="83" who="S0653">mm <pause dur="short"/> there could have been other questions which would have been more of a challenge but all of these students are working in English as a second language so it is very difficult for them</u>
<u n="84" who="S0655">so they need to like <trunc>remem</trunc> so they actually need to know how to read the questions?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0653">sit down please well they it's not just reading the questions they need to understand them and be able to answer in in a lot of detail</u>

<u n="120" who="S0653" trans="overlap">because that would be <trunc>s</trunc> a sad thing wouldn't it? <pause dur="short"/> I mean you can still play together <pause dur="short"/> outside of school but it would just be a bit more difficult to arrange won't it? <pause dur="long"/> are you looking forward to doing your history <pause dur="short"/> experience on Saturday? <pause dur="short"/> the Ottoman Empire I don't know very much about the Ottoman Empire <pause dur="short"/> so you'll be able to tell me lots and lots <pause dur="short"/> erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s mum messaged me <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> she said <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I well she initially said <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> doesn't mind coming to ours or you coming to his on Saturday but I said let the boys talk about it tomorrow</u>
<u n="121" who="S0655">I really really want to go to his house</u>
<u n="122" who="S0653">yeah but you are not going you are not going to go to his house because you haven't been invited because this is a <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> thing but it may be <pause dur="short"/> I don't know their house is don't keep tapping their house is a bit of a building site they haven't got a roof at the moment you know <pause dur="short"/> they actually have no roof</u>
<u n="123" who="S0655">what if it rains?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0653">they've got a plastic sheet over it now</u>
<u n="125" who="S0654">mm</u>
<u n="126" who="S0655">what if it thunders? what if a lightning bolt strikes the roof?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0653">well I think we'd all be in trouble if that that happened but <pause dur="short"/> yeah amazing isn't it but they the lady that used to own the house was very old and so didn't really couldn't really look after the property for the last sort of ten years or so they need a new roof and a new lots of new things electricity kind of new wires and things like</u>
<u n="128" who="S0655">what are we doing?</u>
<u n="129" who="S0653">well for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s mum because they were all I think it it was very cold when they went in there for a while and they were all sleeping in the same room for a bit it's just it's always this sort of thing that happens when it's not very nice weather like lots of people's boilers seem to need fixing and that kind of thing in winter it never happens in the summer because it wouldn't be too bad to have no roof in the summer would it but this is it is still winterish</u>
<u n="130" who="S0655">it wouldn't be bad at all</u>
<u n="131" who="S0653">well it depend if it was like a roasting hot day it would be okay wouldn't it but this is although it's spring it's still very icy outside</u>
<u n="132" who="S0655" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mum</u>
<u n="133" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="134" who="S0655">in the summer I don't think I'm actually going to need a blanket</u>
<u n="135" who="S0653">no well that's why you still have your baby blanket so they're the lightest blanket you can have the thing is I don't ever sleep well in the summer because I like to have a quilt I like to be all snuggly and I find it very difficult to sleep without one even if it's really hot I still try and have a quilt</u>
<u n="136" who="S0655" trans="overlap">me to <pause dur="short"/> although I cannot sleep with a quilt in the summer</u>
<u n="137" who="S0653">no we've got like we've got an autumn quilt and a spring quilt which we put <trunc>toget</trunc> a summer quilt which we put together to make a winter one but even that is still but then we didn't really have a very hot summer last year did we? not really we had like a weekend when it was boiling and that was it</u>
<u n="138" who="S0654" trans="overlap">freezing <pause dur="short"/> you should have gone to Spain it was so hot</u>
<u n="139" who="S0653">well I yeah I <trunc>w</trunc> I mean it's alright being in a hot country if you are next to water isn't it?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0654">there was hardly any water</u>
<u n="141" who="S0653">no I mean swimming pool</u>
<u n="142" who="S0654">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0653">you can keep cool that way</u>
<u n="144" who="S0655">I was normally next to water</u>
<u n="145" who="S0653">sorry</u>
<u n="146" who="S0655">I was normally next to water and if not I'd probably be inside water</u>
<u n="147" who="S0653" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0654">er mama I saw this like thing on another house it was like a pool with a waterfall going into another bit and erm you could get out the other bit to the so if you like fell down that bit you couldn't get out yeah because the waterfall was going down</u>
<u n="149" who="S0653" trans="overlap">oh wow <pause dur="short"/> oh really <pause dur="short"/> into a swimming pool?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0654">into a pool</u>
<u n="151" who="S0653">into a pool that seems was it meant for people to go in there?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0654">I don't know</u>
<u n="153" who="S0653">that seems a bit of a silly design</u>
<u n="154" who="S0654">because I saw a house across</u>
<u n="155" who="S0653">how nice was it a man-made waterfall presumably someone built it?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0654">yeah it was basically like erm towers <unclear/> it was basically like a <trunc>wa</trunc> a waterfall like you've got at Legoland that you slide down</u>
<u n="157" who="S0653">like the one in Legoland ah</u>
<u n="158" who="S0654">it just goes down down down down down</u>
<u n="159" who="S0653">okay but in someone's house that's pretty cool</u>
<u n="160" who="S0654">outside</u>
<u n="161" who="S0653">well yes that would be less cool inside I think</u>
<u n="162" who="S0655">mum?</u>
<u n="163" who="S0653">yes</u>
<u n="164" who="S0654">you are allowed two <unclear/></u>
<u n="165" who="S0655">why do people die if they fall down a waterfall?</u>
<u n="166" who="S0653">well they don't necessarily die but it's a long way to fall so they tend to hit their head on something</u>
<u n="167" who="S0654">yeah and it has erm the and it has rapids you are basically like has really <unclear/></u>
<u n="168" who="S0655">no the rapids are before the waterfall</u>
<u n="169" who="S0653">the rapids are before the waterfall it <trunc>basic</trunc> it tends to have jaggedy rocks at the bottom so it's the fall I mean actually the force of water can break your arm on its own when it's very strong but it's that long drop and then for hitting something even the water because diving people when they go diving you can break an arm you know when you were doing five metre dives people do can easily break things sort of at the ten metre mark so it's hitting the force of the water badly</u>
<u n="170" who="S0655">I may have like erm I nearly broke my arm when I fell when I did a face plant into the water from the three metre</u>
<u n="171" who="S0653">well you didn't nearly break your arm but it does hurt doesn't it?</u>
<u n="172" who="S0655">yeah a huge amount</u>
<u n="173" who="S0653">it does hurt yes it's surprising how much getting landing in the water badly can really hurt</u>
<u n="174" who="S0655">yeah but if you point your feet and you land down straight as long as there's no jaggedy rocks at the bottom and it's quite and it's deep enough then you will survive</u>
<u n="175" who="S0653">but the problem with a waterfall is that that you know you are in water you are not leaping into water you are in water already and it's pushing you around and you probably don't know where you are going you can't see anything so you can't right yourself and get yourself into a position</u>
<u n="176" who="S0655"><unclear> I'm the same</unclear> I'd been like you might have actually missed the water and might be flying</u>
<u n="177" who="S0653">you might do but I just think it's very dangerous and they they can be very big drops can't they?</u>
<u n="178" who="S0655">yeah</u>
