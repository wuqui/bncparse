<u n="197" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0454">or even the health side then actually game is a very ethical meat to eat because it's not being kept cooped up</u>
<u n="199" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="200" who="S0454">it's lived wild all its life and it doesn't have much fat on it unlike</u>

<u n="232" who="S0454">it was really professional it was underground all soundproofed <pause dur="short"/> when you go in they give you a catalogue at the reception I mean you could be in a doctor's surgery it was so nice</u>
<u n="233" who="S0579">oh</u>
<u n="234" who="S0454">a catalogue full of guns and you have to choose which gun you want hundreds in there so I thought I don't know so I asked the man I thought well he knows doesn't he? I said I want erm a small gun without much recoil cos I've shot those big rifles before</u>
<u n="235" who="S0579" trans="overlap">nearly break your arm yeah</u>
<u n="236" who="S0454">and I had a bruise</u>

<u n="238" who="S0454">yeah it was too heavy for me the whole thing was too heavy so I said I want something small without much recoil</u>
<u n="239" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="240" who="S0454">and erm yes he said oh you need erm a Glock that's what they have in all the films it's very light and there's not much recoil so a lot of women like these</u>
<u n="241" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="242" who="S0454">and then they gave you all the training without the bullets obviously so they teach you how to stand how to hold it <trunc>s</trunc> firmly you know not to turn around with a loaded gun in your hand</u>
<u n="243" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no no it's <trunc>dang</trunc> not supposed to turn around no</u>
<u n="244" who="S0454">not supposed to turn around</u>
<u n="245" who="S0579">no</u>
<u n="246" who="S0454">yes how how to load the bullets that sort of thing so they show you all of that and then you go down to the range and they've got those moving targets you know?</u>
<u n="247" who="S0579">oh yes</u>
<u n="248" who="S0454">a proper you know gun range so at first they put it about twenty-five metres away or something</u>
<u n="249" who="S0579" trans="overlap">they're moving targets? oh wow <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>mm</unclear></u>
<u n="250" who="S0454">er you know it's a sort of it was just erm the ones with circles and</u>
<u n="251" who="S0579">I'd forgotten those targets we used to have them I know <unclear/></u>
<u n="252" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah yeah and you have to aim</u>
<u n="253" who="S0579">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="254" who="S0454">erm of course cos you close one eye</u>
<u n="255" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0454">actually that throws your eye off doesn't it?</u>
<u n="257" who="S0579">it does yeah</u>
<u n="258" who="S0454">it's quite interesting they made us practise actually without a gun and they said you know look at your finger with both eyes now close one eye and say what happens to your finger so if I close my right eye it actually makes my finger look like it's moved to the left</u>
<u n="259" who="S0579" trans="overlap">moved yeah yeah</u>
<u n="260" who="S0454">so he said you've got to counteract for that with the gun because you're thinking</u>
<u n="261" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="262" who="S0454">things are further to the left when they really are cos you've closed one eye so you've actually got to aim slightly more to the right than you think</u>
<u n="263" who="S0579">yes yeah</u>
<u n="264" who="S0454">and also when you shoot a gun the barrel comes up as you shoot as you pull the trigger the <trunc>gu</trunc> the barrel will come up slightly so he said you've got to aim slightly further down than you think the target is</u>
<u n="265" who="S0579" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="266" who="S0454">so it's quite interesting there's quite a lot of like calculation cos you've got to aim <pause dur="short"/> yeah further to the right and further down than you think then you'll hit the bullseye</u>
<u n="267" who="S0579">mm</u>
<u n="268" who="S0454">I was terrible at it</u>

<u n="404" who="S0454">yes</u>

<u n="406" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah they're not yes they're not always very good in the supermarket</u>
<u n="407" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no</u>

<u n="411" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes yeah I was reading about growing your own oyster mushrooms the other day it's a bit of a long-term project though it takes at least a year to get your first harvest</u>
<u n="412" who="S0580" trans="overlap"><unclear>is it?</unclear></u>
<u n="413" who="S0454">it's easy apparently well firstly you need to get the right kind of logs and they like oak so you you're supposed to go and buy green oak you know as in newly cut because you don't want older wood cos then it'll already be infected with various fungi anyway and then on mine like off Amazon you can buy you know those dowel pins you get like on</u>
<u n="414" who="S0580">mm</u>
<u n="415" who="S0454">sort of tables and <trunc>e</trunc></u>
<u n="416" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="417" who="S0454">you know cheap furniture they have the the slot together with those so you buy those off the internet but you can get ones that have been erm I don't know what they call it sort of impregnated with spores from the oyster mushroom or whatever</u>
<u n="418" who="S0579">mm</u>
<u n="419" who="S0454">tree mushroom it is you're after and what you do is you get a drill and you drill into the the wood and then you insert these dowel</u>
<u n="420" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="421" who="S0454">like pins into it</u>
<u n="422" who="S0579">mm</u>
<u n="423" who="S0454">erm and that's it you just like leave it for a year outside and off they come or in your garage whatever</u>
<u n="424" who="S0580">are you going to try?</u>
<u n="425" who="S0454">I might do it as a project this autumn actually</u>
<u n="426" who="S0580">yeah</u>
<u n="427" who="S0579">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="428" who="S0454" trans="overlap">if I <trunc>s</trunc> find some oak or I'll look up what other woods you could use yeah be quite fun wouldn't it? other countries do it a lot more</u>
<u n="429" who="S0580" trans="overlap">I like <unclear>mushrooms</unclear> yeah</u>
<u n="430" who="S0454">yeah it's quiet common in Japan or China people do grow mushrooms but in the UK it's quite unusual it's quite hard to grow other sorts of mushrooms</u>
<u n="431" who="S0580">yes they're a bit specialised aren't they those?</u>
<u n="432" who="S0454">it's a quite a specialised thing and</u>
<u n="433" who="S0579">yes</u>
<u n="434" who="S0454">if it gets infected with another soil you have to throw the whole lot away so it's not simple at all</u>
<u n="435" who="S0579">no I know we used to act for some people who used to do mushrooms</u>
<u n="436" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that's right yeah you you had that mushroom farm client</u>
<u n="437" who="S0579" trans="overlap">and they er they used to erm spray them quite often like</u>
<u n="438" who="S0454">ah right yes apparently it's very complicated to grow</u>
<u n="439" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yes yes <unclear>it's</unclear></u>
<u n="440" who="S0454">one sort of mushroom</u>
<u n="441" who="S0579">that's right</u>
<u n="442" who="S0454">in you know that medium because of the infectation</u>
<u n="443" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah you get one's like that and then the other one's like that <unclear>that's all</unclear></u>
<u n="444" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah you basically have to to work in a clean room</u>
<u n="445" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="446" who="S0454">to start them off a sterile room with all the gear and everything it's</u>
<u n="447" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="448" who="S0454">yeah it's things just infect it otherwise it makes sense doesn't it? cos we know like mould grows even in fridges</u>
<u n="449" who="S0580" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="450" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="451" who="S0580" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="452" who="S0454">even if you leave you know even if you put something in a fridge and you put bleach in there and you leave it a bit too long it will still grow</u>
