<u n="82" who="S0115">for mayonnaise?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0037">anyway</u>
<u n="84" who="S0115">have you not googled How to make mayonnaise?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0037">yeah I've got I'm on the BBC Food one that I normally like</u>
<u n="86" who="S0115" trans="overlap"><unclear/> uh rather obvious</u>
<u n="87" who="S0037">um <pause dur="short"/> anyway</u>
<u n="88" who="S0115">is that my one actually</u>
<u n="89" who="S0037">that's mine I've just opened that <pause dur="short"/> tE do you want? Yours is here</u>
<u n="90" who="S0115"><unclear/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0037">anyway so <pause dur="short"/> so then he was saying um <pause dur="short"/> then I said Have you thought about any? <trunc>Th</trunc> then they said he they decided not to find out if it's a girl or a boy</u>
<u n="92" who="S0115">decided not to?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and he said and I said Oh I mean understand like it's a good surprise <pause dur="short"/> I said Oh is there any reason? And he said well Apparently <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> TE  mam had loadsa miscarriages and so did her nana and her aunties and they're just worried like <pause dur="short"/> suppose they're just being a bit cautious he said like if he <pause dur="short"/> if they sort of started thinking about it like as a boy or a girl <pause dur="short"/> and then anything happened <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0115">make it worse?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0037">so okay here's Delia's recipe <pause dur="short"/> two egg yolks <pause dur="short"/> put the egg yolks in a basin <pause dur="short"/> add the salt and pepper</u>
<u n="96" who="S0115">okay <pause dur="short"/> I'll just get some salt</u>
<u n="97" who="S0037">then holding your electric whisk in one hand</u>
<u n="98" who="S0115">right</u>
<u n="99" who="S0037"><vocal desc="laugh"/> uh add a drop of oil to the mixture and whisk in</u>
<u n="100" who="S0115">right it's just sort of whisked in</u>
<u n="101" who="S0037">then it says However stupid this may sound the key to successful mayonnaise is make sure each drop of oil is thoroughly whisked in before adding the next drop <pause dur="short"/> it won't take all day because after a few minutes the mixture will go thick and very stiff and lumpy <pause dur="short"/> when you get to this stage add a teaspoon of vinegar <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0115">so could use uh</u>
<u n="103" who="S0037" trans="overlap">so you pour it you you pour it a drop at a time</u>
<u n="104" who="S0115">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0037">and then</u>
<u n="106" who="S0115">could use um <pause dur="short"/> uh <pause dur="short"/> our um blender thing</u>
<u n="107" who="S0037">yeah? It <trunc>prob</trunc> that would probably be better</u>
<u n="108" who="S0115">but uh wasn't sure like if that would like rip it up and?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0037">no I it'll be fine <pause dur="short"/> that'll be quicker</u>
<u n="110" who="S0115">and um <pause dur="short"/> so any other news from Tom?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0037" trans="overlap">oh and then I said erm have you thought of any? Are you staying with the same names? And they said he said Oh if it's a boy I'm still going to call him <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="112" who="S0115">fair enough</u>
<u n="113" who="S0037">if it's a girl they're had a new idea and they're thinking of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="114" who="S0115">oh right</u>
<u n="115" who="S0037">but calling her <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> which I quite like <pause dur="short"/> definitely better than <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> which isn't even a real name anyway</u>
<u n="116" who="S0115">yeah I mean well I would have said you like there is a slight risk with with uh with rarer names</u>
<u n="117" who="S0037" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> sounds quite nice</u>
<u n="118" who="S0115">I think the rarer name can be a bit like be a bit of a stigma sometimes</u>
<u n="119" who="S0037">but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s quite nice?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0115">yeah I think that's that's that's alright yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0037">I was like Yeah <pause dur="short"/> do that one <pause dur="short"/> do that one  <pause dur="short"/> never mind <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="122" who="S0115">that's pretty um</u>
<u n="123" who="S0037">so</u>
<u n="124" who="S0115">that's that sounds good yeah <pause dur="short"/> I like it</u>
<u n="125" who="S0037" trans="overlap">that's where that is <pause dur="short"/> and then he was saying</u>
<u n="126" who="S0115">getting kind of thicker now</u>
<u n="127" who="S0037">have you put any oil in?</u>
<u n="128" who="S0115">yeah I have</u>
<u n="129" who="S0037">but just do a drop <pause dur="short"/> like literally a drop at a time Delia said</u>
<u n="130" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah I know <pause dur="short"/> that's the second drop <pause dur="short"/> yeah second drop's gone in yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0037">um</u>
<u n="132" who="S0115">you've got to uh yeah like I guess you've got to uh yeah like I guess you've got to like whisk whip it for ages so that it um</u>
<u n="133" who="S0037">do you want me to do some? Is your hand getting tired?</u>
<u n="134" who="S0115">uh yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> whisk it to make sure all the oil is um distributed <pause dur="short"/> uh so that'll be fine</u>
<u n="135" who="S0037">and then?</u>
<u n="136" who="S0115">so yeah <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s a better name isn't it uh than <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="137" who="S0037">that's much better</u>
<u n="138" who="S0115">I think it would <pause dur="short"/> it might be a bit of a stigma if you gave</u>
<u n="139" who="S0037">I know</u>
<u n="140" who="S0115">if you had a name like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> and then uh anything else?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0037">um <pause dur="short"/> what was he saying? He was saying they're thinking about like maybe moving to a different place cos obviously they're in like a one-bedroom flat <pause dur="short"/> at the moment</u>
<u n="142" who="S0115">yeah yeah it's hard to raise a child if you've only got one bedroom</u>
<u n="143" who="S0037">but he said he'll obviously have to just save up because they need to get</u>
<u n="144" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well he seems to be making quite a bit of money doesn't he?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0037">well they need to get the new deposit before they get the old deposit back <pause dur="short"/> you know same as us here</u>
<u n="146" who="S0115">you need to?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0037">like we've got a <trunc>de</trunc> like we've got like fifteen hundred pounds of deposit held with our letting agent</u>
<u n="148" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0037">but if we wanted to move we'd have to find a new fifteen hundred pounds before we got the old one back</u>
<u n="150" who="S0115">I see right <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> some house deposits are very high aren't they?</u>
<u n="151" who="S0037">oh if you wanted to buy yeah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0037">no I don't think he's in quite that state yet <pause dur="short"/> anyway and then um <pause dur="short"/> what else what he saying? Oh I said I was telling him about  <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and he was like Oh we should go there on like me you and Matt <pause dur="short"/> we should go <pause dur="short"/> and I was thinking um baby?</u>

<u n="165" who="S0037">no</u>
<u n="166" who="S0115">um <pause dur="short"/> I guess it's kind of partly up to the discretion of the uh TE you know how much oil you put is is up to TE you know personal taste innit?

I think we might've um think think we might've <pause dur="short"/> can I help <pause dur="short"/> I think we might've made a mistake because like that's the wrong type of instrument I think like</u>

<u n="689" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <trunc>some</trunc> but if I was <pause dur="short"/> yeah it sounds nice  sounds nice  like to get out and go south of France or something get a house and like grow loads of like grapes and stuff but uh</u>
<u n="690" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but it's the same as anything like <pause dur="short"/> I think I'm realistic like any job  any job  it no matter how fantastic it sounds there's always like crap bits isn't there like? And I think</u>
<u n="691" who="S0115">well I mean you got some some jobs are just some jobs are definitely better than others well  you know I suppose</u>
<u n="692" who="S0037" trans="overlap">like if if my job was like knitting things all day I would I'm sure I would get totally pissed off with it like <pause dur="short"/> but because it's not and it's just something I like doing then I like doing it <pause dur="short"/> like I was just saying there like the gardening I'd like a bigger garden with like <trunc>mo</trunc> I'd like a greenhouse I'd like more space</u>

<u n="895" who="S0115" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Tent Tent Peg</u>

<u n="902" who="S0037">well no <pause dur="short"/> I mean to buy one for himself and it was like pardon me it was really expensive so then</u>
<u n="903" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah so bought like a <unclear/> like like he's like bit like Del Boy he's a bit of that in him</u>
<u n="904" who="S0037">he <trunc>i</trunc> he is definitely like Del Boy <pause dur="short"/> so then he worked so then he looked into how much he would cost to buy <pause dur="short"/> cos he had some mates who wanted one as well or something</u>
<u n="905" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="906" who="S0037">and so then he worked how much it would cost to buy ten and how much it would cost to buy a hundred or whatever <pause dur="short"/> so then he got in touch with some <trunc>h</trunc> whoever and bought like however many</u>
<u n="907" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="908" who="S0037">then started selling them online <pause dur="short"/> so he's been doing that and then I think now I'm not sure if he's rented a a rail in like a alternative shop in the Galleries <pause dur="short"/> alternative I mean like</u>

<u n="912" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well he said it's doing some <pause dur="short"/> it's paying some bills</u>
<u n="913" who="S0115">it it did sound promising um</u>
<u n="914" who="S0037" trans="overlap">so <pause dur="short"/> and he's like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s he's doing <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s nana's garden and he's washing someone else's car and</u>

<u n="925" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I think that that is  that is  more it's the most promising sort of thing</u>
