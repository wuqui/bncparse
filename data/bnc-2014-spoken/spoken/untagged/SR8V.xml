<u n="30" who="S0612">you need people to endorse your skills?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0610">yeah and you will find that loads of people that you know are on it and it'll automatically tell you cos it's like links up to Facebook or <trunc>kn</trunc> it just fucking knows it's scary I'll show you if you like on what mine looks like</u>
<u n="32" who="S0428">yeah I need to update mine as well</u>

<u n="34" who="S0612">what? Linkedin?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0610">yeah and especially if you're in HR I bet lots of HR people use it</u>
<u n="36" who="S0612" trans="overlap">oh that's so <trunc>annoyi</trunc> why can't people just like your read CVs nowadays?</u>
<u n="37" who="S0610" trans="overlap">I know but</u>
<u n="38" who="S0428" trans="overlap">erm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0610">it's just a case really of getting whatever's on your CV on there and then getting a a <trunc>prof</trunc>a profile picture of yourself and then really all it is is it'll just automatically say oh do you know this person? link up with them do you know this person? <unclear>and go</unclear> and then so everyone you know you can just link up with and then you might think oh who have I worked with in the past? <trunc>l</trunc><trunc>l</trunc>look them up <trunc>mayb</trunc> you know and they might be on there <pause dur="short"/> it's easier than you think</u>
<u n="40" who="S0428">and actually like I have a really bad profile like I don't even have a picture don't have anything on it and erm I've been headhunted a couple of times through it like</u>
<u n="41" who="S0612">oh wow</u>
<u n="42" who="S0428">yeah people have said oh er erm have you thought about applying for this job?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0610">yeah so that's a really good way of using it</u>
<u n="44" who="S0428">and I I haven't I haven't put myself honestly I've not put myself out there at all so</u>
<u n="45" who="S0612">but cos the girls were talking about it at work and they were like endorse mm the fact that I'm good with customers so people click on something</u>
<u n="46" who="S0610">yeah so there are these skills so it says</u>
<u n="47" who="S0612" trans="overlap">but nobody's gonna like my skills now</u>
<u n="48" who="S0610">yeah they will cos er I even like people who say your friends at work or your er</u>
<u n="49" who="S0428" trans="overlap">oh you took my tea away</u>
<u n="50" who="S0610">no</u>
<u n="51" who="S0428">my green tea</u>

<u n="53" who="S0428"><unclear>just hiding it from me</unclear></u>
<u n="54" who="S0610">erm</u>
<u n="55" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0612">you took my tea</u>
<u n="57" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="58" who="S0610">erm <pause dur="short"/> if they're on it then they can endorse you you know? and do you have what who's your manager at work? or <trunc>h</trunc> who er do you know someone above you at work?</u>
<u n="59" who="S0612">uhu</u>
<u n="60" who="S0610">would they be on Linkedin?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0612">I dunno</u>
<u n="62" who="S0610">well you might be surprised <pause dur="short"/> or if they are and they've just got a dormant profile maybe you could always just like message them and say hey do you mind just logging in to Linkedin and? <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="63" who="S0612">mm</u>
<u n="64" who="S0428">the thing is it's quite cringey but then it's the way things are done now</u>
<u n="65" who="S0610">yeah what I don't like is that you just type in <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> or whatever on Google and it's like the third thing on there and then people just see everything <trunc>ab</trunc> you know?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah I don't like it at all and also the endorsing skills my dad endorsed me how shit does that look? like <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="67" who="S0610">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0612">does it say does it show you who endorses who?</u>
<u n="69" who="S0610">yeah you can click on it</u>
<u n="70" who="S0428"><unclear>but er</unclear></u>
<u n="71" who="S0610" trans="overlap">the worst thing I think is that you can see when someone's seen your profile?</u>
<u n="72" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0610">so like you'll go onto people who you're interested in and they know that you've <trunc>see</trunc> like you've been looking at their profile which I think's a bit weird</u>
<u n="74" who="S0428" trans="overlap">so I never look at anyone</u>
<u n="75" who="S0610">mm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0428">I never go on it to be honest</u>
<u n="77" who="S0610">erm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0612">it's just annoys me that you have to have Twitter Facebook</u>
<u n="79" who="S0428">but I don't think you do</u>
<u n="80" who="S0612">blah blah blah blah di blah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0428">I just I also think in a <trunc>wa</trunc>in a way like that you can do that and you also can not? like I no like erm <vocal desc="misc"/> when when I started my master's they were like right you'll have a Twitter account in a week and I was like I probably won't because I don't want that and er obviously</u>
<u n="82" who="S0612" trans="overlap"><unclear>right</unclear> yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0428">there is that whole part of the industry where everyone's like <trunc>ma</trunc> there are loads of jobs that are on there and blah blah blah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0610">yeah it's true</u>
<u n="85" who="S0428" trans="overlap">but also they're not <trunc>j</trunc> they don't just put them on Twitter they put them er other places as well</u>
<u n="86" who="S0612">do you guys have Twitter?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0428">no</u>
<u n="88" who="S0610">I do although I haven't ever used it really and er oh it's embarrassing cos actually that's like the second thing down and there's a shitty picture of like oh anyway but actually a lot of journalists say but maybe it's different for HR cos journalism er you have to have a Twitter account but I don't use it</u>
<u n="89" who="S0428">but then that's what Twitter's was was set up for journalism wasn't it? I guess</u>
<u n="90" who="S0610">but don't worry about that but Linkedin if you're looking for a job first thing you should do I think cos it is like taking your CV</u>
<u n="91" who="S0612" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0610">to just online and that can only be a good thing</u>
<u n="93" who="S0612">yeah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0610">and once you've set it up and put your CV on there and stuff you don't necessarily have to use it again it's just a good way of maybe of just having <trunc>yours</trunc>yourself out there</u>
<u n="95" who="S0612">yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0610">it is scary though when you look up your name and then see like everything you've done in the past is on there and I hate it cos I thought god if I ever if I ever get famous</u>
<u n="97" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="98" who="S0612">well with your articles coming out left right and centre</u>
<u n="99" who="S0428" trans="overlap"><unclear>I'm sure</unclear></u>
<u n="100" who="S0610"><unclear/> no but if you ever became like a reputable journalist or whatever then people will look you up won't they? that's the first thing they might do if they like</u>
<u n="101" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0610">trying to commission you whatever and then you've got like your blog from when you were fucking fifteen on there or like</u>
<u n="103" who="S0612">I think Facebook's difficult for us <trunc>b</trunc> well</u>
<u n="104" who="S0610">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0612">er it depends what you've done but</u>
