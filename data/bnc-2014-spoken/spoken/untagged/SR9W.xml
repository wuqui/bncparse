<u n="1" who="S0671">yeah</u>
<u n="2" who="S0670">okay right so is this a good distance to throw from then?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0671">yeah I think so</u>
<u n="4" who="S0670">so you</u>
<u n="5" who="S0671" trans="overlap">but I <trunc>d</trunc> well I</u>
<u n="6" who="S0670" trans="overlap"><unclear/> further?</u>
<u n="7" who="S0671">we could go further we could go like let's try this yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0670">so I mean how are you gonna do this?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0671" trans="overlap">as in before I had it like there and we were both spread out so</u>
<u n="10" who="S0670">okay so</u>
<u n="11" who="S0671" trans="overlap">so when we were talking just now it was like that whole</u>
<u n="12" who="S0670">yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0671"><unclear>like</unclear></u>
<u n="14" who="S0670">okay so do you wanna be a little closer?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0671">no this is fine</u>
<u n="16" who="S0670">okay cool perfect we'll get equidistant</u>
<u n="17" who="S0671"><unclear>we'll</unclear></u>
<u n="18" who="S0670">and it can pick up everything</u>
<u n="19" who="S0671" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it's I think I should do a study on erm when people well obviously there have been studies done before on</u>
<u n="20" who="S0670" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0671">the whole like the fact that you're being recorded in some way makes you change your erm the way you speak and what you talk about</u>
<u n="22" who="S0670">so like the uncertainty <trunc>pr</trunc>principle? like on quantum mechanics where if you observe a erm a particle then you change what it's doing you cannot know for sure where a particle is and how fast it's going you can know how fast one's going and or you can know where it is but if you know both then in observing it you're going to change its course</u>
<u n="23" who="S0671">really?</u>
<u n="24" who="S0670">yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0671">oh so that's er</u>
<u n="26" who="S0670" trans="overlap">and that is like the scientific equivalent of this wherein</u>
<u n="27" who="S0671" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="28" who="S0670">when you know you're <trunc>b</trunc> when you're being observed it changes what you're saying</u>
<u n="29" who="S0671">erm okay what about could you translate it into attributes of character? so</u>
<u n="30" who="S0670">okay</u>
<u n="31" who="S0671">it's like</u>
<u n="32" who="S0670" trans="overlap">can you elaborate on that?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0671" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <unclear>thing</unclear> so erm you don't a part of you doesn't erm <pause dur="short"/> I mean <trunc>th</trunc>things are changing all the time but er perhaps I'm talking about <pause dur="short"/> oh no it's a slightly different thing isn't it? cos obviously things are changing without you thinking about it</u>
<u n="34" who="S0670">yeah but I mean like what? so you're are you talking about erm characteristics in relation to being recorded? or characteristics in the whole idea of uncertainty</u>
<u n="35" who="S0671" trans="overlap">of self</u>
<u n="36" who="S0670" trans="overlap">principle? of self?</u>
<u n="37" who="S0671">yeah so how much does the self change when you think about it?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0670">oh that's good you lost me there for a minute but in that</u>
<u n="39" who="S0671" trans="overlap">yeah sorry cos I</u>
<u n="40" who="S0670" trans="overlap">last sentence you you brought it all back you whipped it round erm</u>
<u n="41" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="42" who="S0670">it was it was like an eclipse I I lost sight of the conversation for a second there</u>
<u n="43" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/> erm when I did the recording with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="44" who="S0670">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="45" who="S0671">erm and it's happening er to an extent now</u>
<u n="46" who="S0670">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0671">but</u>
<u n="48" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0671">it was like a it was like it was almost as if like we weren't chatting to each other it was like a radio show <vocal desc="laugh"/> it was brilliant</u>
<u n="50" who="S0670"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I mean it is a little bit like</u>
<u n="51" who="S0671" trans="overlap">and it's happening now cos like <vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm not I'm we're kind of like there's another party in the room so</u>
<u n="52" who="S0670">I'm not gonna lie there have been points in this conversation where like</u>
<u n="53" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="54" who="S0670">I'm talking to you but my eyes are kind of just flicking towards the phone like</u>
<u n="55" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0670">like we have some kind of mediator between us <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="57" who="S0671">I know we need to talk about something like</u>
<u n="58" who="S0670">yes</u>
<u n="59" who="S0671">that is <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>well er</unclear></u>
<u n="60" who="S0670" trans="overlap">abstract? solid?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0671">that is what we'd normally be talking about</u>
<u n="62" who="S0670">right so let's <trunc>d</trunc> okay two topics of conversation do you want to talk about your trip in the summer? or do you want to talk about the abstract concept of the self and how it changes upon thought?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> neither I'll tell you er well <unclear>but er</unclear></u>
<u n="64" who="S0670" trans="overlap">great <vocal desc="laugh"/> thanks for that</u>
<u n="65" who="S0671"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="66" who="S0670">destroying</u>

<u n="68" who="S0670" trans="overlap">all of my ideas there <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="69" who="S0671">when I was when I was out getting the shopping I erm I wanted I like wanted to do two things when I got home one was watch an international rugby match</u>
<u n="70" who="S0670">uhu okay</u>
