<u n="1" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> and it's I bought that recorder actually to try to record birdsong because I'm hopeless at identifying birdsong and I thought I've got a DVD but you watch the DVD then you go out in the woods and you can't remember so I thought if I recorded stuff while I was out there <pause dur="short"/> I could come back and play it and immediately watch the DVD and try to identify what I'd heard and it does it <trunc>work</trunc> you're walking through the woods and yes it picks up birds from quite a distance away but I've never actually got around to to listening to them trying to it's really difficult you you press record and the damn thing shuts up again <pause dur="short"/> erm or you press record and you get fifteen different birds all calling <vocal desc="laugh"/> at the same time in different with different songs and it's just</u>
<u n="2" who="S0389" trans="overlap">we'll have to buy you one of those clocks have you seen the clocks where er er every so there are twelve different bird songs so at</u>
<u n="3" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="4" who="S0389">on the hour at one o'clock two o'clock three o'clock</u>
<u n="5" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="6" who="S0389">then you will get a different bird tweeting and it's like a</u>
<u n="7" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and does it tell you what it is?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0389">erm I haven't investigated cos I haven't <vocal desc="cough"/> we <vocal desc="cough"/> <pause dur="short"/> we don't have clocks that chime or but erm</u>
<u n="9" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0389">but erm yeah we'll have to investigate yeah I I presume I presume certainly if it it'll tell you when you get with the instructions of the box you'll get you know at one o'clock you will hear I presume and I think there are also pictures on the face</u>
<u n="11" who="S0238">right</u>
<u n="12" who="S0389"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="13" who="S0238">I'm looking very dubious though cos I can imagine it keeping me awake all night <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0389">well you'd have to have it in here always</u>
<u n="15" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yeah but I sleep with with I normally have that door open cos I get up from time to time and get a drink of water or something so</u>
<u n="16" who="S0389">mm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0238">that wouldn't necessarily stop me hearing it</u>
<u n="18" who="S0389">ah right no that that might not be a good idea</u>
<u n="19" who="S0238">put it this way <pause dur="short"/> I bought I used to have a lovely little erm alarm clock which was really neat for travelling and everything <pause dur="short"/> which was in my bedroom and it broke I'd had it for years and years and it broke and it just I you know I thought the battery had gone and I'd replace it and no it didn't <unclear/> so I went to buy another one and I all I was looking for at that point was something small and neat bought it brought it home first night I had to put it I just couldn't take it cos the tick was too loud</u>
<u n="20" who="S0389">mm</u>
<u n="21" who="S0238">so <pause dur="short"/> I went again I mean they're only little cheap things from the market so I went again and said look I've got to listen to this before I take it you know and buy I'm gonna buy another one and I listened to it and in the shop it was that was the quietest one he'd got it was really quiet fine I bring it home here I can't it's ridiculously loud in my bedroom I can't stand the thing <unclear/> put it out in the hall and even in the hall with the bedroom door open I could hear it ticking <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> it must depend on what it's standing on</u>
<u n="22" who="S0389">erm <vocal desc="cough"/> <pause dur="short"/> does such a thing exist as a digital little really tiny alarm clock? they must mustn't they?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I guess</u>
<u n="24" who="S0389">where you can actually set it for eight thirty-six whatever because at the moment I'm the alarm clock I've got I mean it wakes me up vaguely when I want to be woken up</u>
<u n="25" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="26" who="S0389">but I can't put it to quarter</u>
<u n="27" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mobile</u>
<u n="28" who="S0389">well or ten past eight or quarter to eight</u>
<u n="29" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I use my mobile</u>
<u n="30" who="S0389">oh right okay</u>
<u n="31" who="S0238" trans="overlap">which is why I haven't bothered to replace the clock</u>
<u n="32" who="S0389">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0238">I mean I want I like to have I like to know what I always wake up in the night at least once often two or three times and I like to know what time it is and the only way I can do it at the moment is to switch the light on and look at me watch <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> it's not worth the price having something ticking cos it really does irritate you</u>
<u n="34" who="S0389" trans="overlap">mm well I mean mine ticks you didn't hear mine did you through the wall?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="36" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0389">cos it you do hear it you do hear it but I mean mine's good because it's it's luminous and so you know you wake up in the night and you do know what time it is without switching the lights on and stuff but as I say it it you can't make to sort of</u>
<u n="38" who="S0238" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="39" who="S0389">accuracy and sometimes in the morning if I'm going out and catching you know six thirty train five minutes actually makes quite a difference in the middle of the night</u>
<u n="40" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm yes mm mm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0389">you know erm so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> always asks me what I want for Christmas so I said well if you can find me a little you know so that it can go in a suitcase a little erm digital</u>
<u n="42" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0389">alarm clock and that's what she's buying me so she hasn't no I can't what else do you want? so</u>
<u n="44" who="S0238">mm see you know the light of a digital one also irritates me</u>
<u n="45" who="S0389">mm hm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0238">I <unclear>won't</unclear> wear it all the time erm so I it was an analogue on that I'd got but I if its got luminous paint on the hands that's not enough to <pause dur="short"/> jump out at you</u>
<u n="47" who="S0389" trans="overlap">that's what mine's like that's what mine that's what got mm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0238">yes that's fine yeah erm but but an actual digital one it it actually glows and you can even if you turn it round you can still see the glow</u>
<u n="49" who="S0389">oh right</u>
<u n="50" who="S0238">erm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0389" trans="overlap">I don't think that'll put me off</u>
<u n="52" who="S0238">but I don't I don't think that you can well I think you're right with an analogue one that you can't be that accurate with with the alarm unfortunately</u>
<u n="53" who="S0389" trans="overlap">mm no and as I say normally it really doesn't matter but it's just if I have early mornings and if I do the <pause dur="short"/> I've been offered erm erm <pause dur="short"/> a course at the agricultural ministry in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="54" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0389">and they like to have it before work so that's eight o'clock</u>
<u n="56" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="57" who="S0389">so I have to be there like quarter to eight so it means getting a half past six train more or less and and then you really don't want to be woken up ten minutes more than more than necessary</u>
<u n="58" who="S0238" trans="overlap">no no</u>
<u n="59" who="S0389">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0238">mm <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> I I've started using my mobile as an alarm and discovered by accident that you don't need to leave the clock you don't need to leave the phone on if you switch it off it still works as an alarm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0389">oh right and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> uses when we're away</u>
<u n="62" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0389">he uses his his digital</u>
<u n="64" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and obviously you can set that to a precise minute</u>
<u n="65" who="S0389">yeah his his phone as a as an alarm</u>
<u n="66" who="S0238" trans="overlap">and it's not okay you get this voice going the <trunc>ti</trunc> it's time to get up the time is seven twenty-two</u>
<u n="67" who="S0389"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0238">it's time to get up the time is seven <trunc>thir</trunc></u>
<u n="69" who="S0389"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="70" who="S0238">you know</u>
<u n="71" who="S0389">ah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0238">the whatever you get it's some kind of noise <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="73" who="S0389">yeah we just set the</u>
<u n="74" who="S0238" trans="overlap">you could probably actually change what it does anyway I mean I haven't I haven't investigated that but if you can change the ringtone I would imagine you can change the alarm noise as well</u>
<u n="75" who="S0389" trans="overlap">and if you can and if you can turn your satnav to an Australian an Australian male instead of a instead of a British female <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0238">mm exactly so</u>
<u n="77" who="S0389">er</u>
<u n="78" who="S0238">anyway I mean if you're getting one from <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> then it doesn't matter does it</u>
<u n="79" who="S0389" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0238">but if if you don't get one I would investigate that</u>
<u n="81" who="S0389">yeah oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> she always wants to know in about October you know what do you want for Christmas? and I think I've no idea and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s useless but this year he did know what to ask her for because we'll we've been watching Lewis</u>
<u n="82" who="S0238">oh right</u>
<u n="83" who="S0389">and we obviously missed out a complete series <pause dur="short"/> erm because we watch it on ITV three I think it is and they're <trunc>lu</trunc> they're often repeats</u>
<u n="84" who="S0238">right</u>
<u n="85" who="S0389">but we've obviously missed out erm a whole series so he said well he wanted series X of Lewis</u>
<u n="86" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0389">so it was very easy to tell her</u>
<u n="88" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="89" who="S0389">she was she was like you know ecstatic that <vocal desc="laugh"/> three days before Christmas she knew what she was buying for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="90" who="S0238">help yourself</u>
<u n="91" who="S0389">yep</u>
<u n="92" who="S0238">yep</u>
<u n="93" who="S0389">right yours'll be in the post <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> I hope it's RSVP <pause dur="short"/> the card</u>
<u n="94" who="S0238">it is yes</u>
<u n="95" who="S0389"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0238" trans="overlap">erm <pause dur="short"/> well as I say I actually found some this year that said season's greetings <vocal desc="laugh"/> and and that I really liked</u>
<u n="97" who="S0389">and did you buy them from the from the meeting or did you get them online?</u>
<u n="98" who="S0238">I bought them from the meeting</u>
<u n="99" who="S0389">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0238">erm because you're not paying postage then</u>
<u n="101" who="S0389">true</u>
<u n="102" who="S0238">erm and in fact if you want something big she will get it for you and because she's getting a lot of stuff she's not paying postage so that doesn't then that doesn't the cost doesn't get passed onto the</u>
<u n="103" who="S0389">right</u>
<u n="104" who="S0238">customer so</u>
<u n="105" who="S0389">mm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0238">it just makes sense at any time if I want something from them to order it from her</u>
<u n="107" who="S0389">and is the person who did the seed and stuff is she a member of the RSPB?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0238">no er not as far as I know</u>
<u n="109" who="S0389">mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0238">she's just a friend of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who is the treasurer</u>
<u n="111" who="S0389">oh I see</u>
<u n="112" who="S0238">and the <unclear/></u>
<u n="113" who="S0389" trans="overlap">cos I mean it's quite a good idea but some people might get a bit you know well annoyed that you've got some sort of commercial thing going on that's not RSPB I don't I mean it wouldn't worry me</u>
<u n="114" who="S0238" trans="overlap">well well as I say we used to she used to do the actual the seed from the <trunc>RS</trunc> and and there's times of year when it goes and times of year when it doesn't and it's heavy and so on and she ended up stopping doing it and I think fair enough cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> really do an awful lot</u>
<u n="115" who="S0389">mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0238">erm <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> came along committee meeting before last and said her friend and it's all <pause dur="short"/> well <pause dur="short"/> she's got a shop in <anon type="place"/> and it's sort of the equivalent of fair trade coffee but animal food if you see what I mean you know</u>
<u n="117" who="S0389" trans="overlap">okay yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0238">so I think it's something that the RSPB would approve of in other words</u>
<u n="119" who="S0389" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0238">even though it's not actually their stuff <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0389">mm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0238">so we said well we'll give it a try</u>
<u n="123" who="S0389">well when I was waiting for you for the meeting to start there were people behind me talking</u>
<u n="124" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0389">and saying oh this is a good idea cos they have big sacks and they can order and so obviously they were happy</u>
<u n="126" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0389">you know and I would imagine they were not the only ones</u>
<u n="128" who="S0238" trans="overlap">I don't know I can't remember what the what we <trunc>deci</trunc> whether we're actually getting anything from it or whether it's just <pause dur="short"/> she's coming and we're providing her a venue I mean she's giving up an evening when she wouldn't normally be working</u>
<u n="129" who="S0389" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="long"/> but as I say if it's the people behind me were anything to go by people are really quite happy about it there was no question of why's she there or anything</u>
<u n="130" who="S0238">well <pause dur="short"/> you see the <pause dur="short"/> yes okay the RSPB sells stuff <pause dur="short"/> but it sells stuff to make money for what it does <pause dur="short"/> and it is a charity that that it I can't remember what the how what the timeframe is but they sort of said they've only they only have so many months of reserves of money so</u>
<u n="131" who="S0389" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="132" who="S0238">if if money doesn't keep coming in they don't sort of have lots of investments and things they the money that comes in gets used very quickly <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> so yeah they need their commercial enterprises but they're not a commercial organisation what they're interested in is wildlife and if people are buying birdseed then they're preserving the birds for the next year so they shouldn't really have any problem with it I don't think</u>
<u n="133" who="S0389">are you supposed to feed birds the whole year?</u>
<u n="134" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0389">yeah?</u>
<u n="136" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0389">I mean <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> do my dad used to too but I just didn't know whether you could leave off in the summer but</u>
<u n="138" who="S0238">that is actually really a crucial time cos it's when they're feeding their young</u>
<u n="139" who="S0389">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0238">and they've done <trunc>ex</trunc> erm <pause dur="short"/> studies would be a better word than experiments erm cos sparrows the number of sparrows has gone down quite drastically</u>
<u n="141" who="S0389">that's why my sister was so annoyed</u>
<u n="142" who="S0238">yes</u>
<u n="143" who="S0389" trans="overlap">because when on the day there was the count there were no sparrows and the next day she said you know she had lots in her garden</u>
<u n="144" who="S0238">well they'd done studies of sparrows in urban settings where <pause dur="short"/> they fed some of them on mealworms at the time that they were feeding the young and others not and it made a huge difference to how many broods were successfully raised</u>
<u n="145" who="S0389" trans="overlap">oh right uhu</u>
<u n="146" who="S0238">erm which would suggest that we're just erm spraying all our flowers to get rid of the insects or something and they're not getting the protein at the time that they need it I don't know <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but for some reason</u>
<u n="147" who="S0389">mm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0238">they're not getting what they what they need <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and I had I mean the first last year <pause dur="short"/> it was really noticeable I had some grey tits and some blue tits who both had but young which they were bringing <unclear/></u>
<u n="149" who="S0389" trans="overlap">in the trees right at the bottom?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0238">I don't know where the nest was</u>
<u n="151" who="S0389">uhu</u>
<u n="152" who="S0238">but they were coming to my feeder cos I put food out and for <pause dur="short"/> a a couple of months I got nothing and I was quite disappointed I do get quite a lot of cats coming through erm and then suddenly when they'd got the babies I'd got a great tit coming with one day she'd got two babies and she was coming and bringing them to the feeder then she got the food and was putting it in their mouths it was quite interesting to watch next day there were three and the next and then after that there were four so they were just fledging</u>
<u n="153" who="S0389">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0238">erm and even after they'd the the mum had stopped coming with them I was getting the four babies all you know for for quite a few weeks they knew this is where we can get food and and as far as I know all four survived you know at least</u>
<u n="155" who="S0389">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0238">er and blue tits I can't remember how many baby blue tits there were but I'd actually learnt the to recognise the difference between adult and and a baby because they do look different</u>
<u n="157" who="S0389">and <unclear>how</unclear> you recognise the call</u>
<u n="158" who="S0238">well</u>
<u n="159" who="S0389"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0238">I learnt a great tits call cos it's a it's a quite an irritating sort of two-tone squeak <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="161" who="S0389"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="162" who="S0238">and I was sitting <trunc>o</trunc>outside going I wonder what that is? and went and checked and yes that was definitely a great tit but I mean I can identify a few things but you go out on a guided walk with these blokes who are <pause dur="short"/> the the chap sitting behind that guy <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> with the beard who's doing the who does the</u>
<u n="163" who="S0389" trans="overlap">who you were talking who you were talking to</u>
<u n="164" who="S0238" trans="overlap">yes he's a warden at <anon type="place"/> nature reserve which is just down in <anon type="place"/> erm and you and I've been and done erm what they call vis-mig which is visible migration which is a time that everything's migrating you go and stand there's a couple of weeks where you just go out every night at duskish and and count how many things you see go over that's all he's <unclear>doing</unclear></u>
<u n="165" who="S0389" trans="overlap">you don't have to say what it is?</u>

<u n="499" who="S0238">oh that's not nice is it</u>

<u n="501" who="S0238" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="502" who="S0389">and that's why she went into to to erm sheltered accommodation not really because she was forced to</u>
<u n="503" who="S0238">mm</u>
<u n="504" who="S0389">erm and it it wasn't a huge she wouldn't have really been rattling around in the <trunc>fl</trunc> in the bungalow</u>
