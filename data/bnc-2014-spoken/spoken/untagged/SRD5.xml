<u n="41" who="S0293" trans="overlap">well I'd been well I'd been referred to this bloke before</u>
<u n="42" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0293">and er I didn't get on very well with my last physio cos he kept <unclear/> <unclear>stuff which I really don't care I really can't bear to even talk about quite a lot</unclear> <unclear/> and erm er he always held it <unclear/></u>
<u n="44" who="S0282">oh right yes</u>
<u n="45" who="S0293" trans="overlap">and erm and so er and in the end anyway I I didn't end up going to two appointments and er was obviously blacklisted they were furious with me absolutely furious <unclear/></u>
<u n="46" who="S0282">was this a referral? <trunc>w</trunc> did you <trunc>ge</trunc> had you been referred by the?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0293">I'd been referred and then I was referred back a second time yeah I was referred for my back which is the reason well I the reason I wanted to go the er reason I asked for the referral was because I am so bloody stiff all the time I can't move and erm I really can't move any more erm I I I can't put my clothes on and things like that I've been <trunc>t</trunc>been telling you haven't I? for some time how stiff I am and erm I asked them to erm I'll do that afterwards if I start even thinking about it I will not stop talking and erm er <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="48" who="S0282">mm mm <unclear/> so you so you went to the physio? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0293">can't bear it <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I hate it</u>
<u n="50" who="S0282">just pretend that nothing's going on</u>
<u n="51" who="S0293">but I can't when you're <trunc>p</trunc>putting your little pen down it's horrid</u>
<u n="52" who="S0282">sorry</u>
<u n="53" who="S0293">anyway erm</u>
<u n="54" who="S0282">I don't have to do that</u>
<u n="55" who="S0293">erm yeah so I'd already been referred for my back and er then I ended up doing this <unclear/> stuff which drove me mad and erm then I got referred again and I missed two appointments so she was absolutely hopping mad with me so I went in there and I thought oh my god she's gonna be <trunc>s</trunc> she did give me such a hard time and erm actually I said look I'll be perfectly frank what I want is I want a set of exercises cos I am so stiff I don't know what to do with myself and I've got knee pain and back pain and actually she was really very switched on erm and she says yes I am extraordinarily erm stiff <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="57" who="S0293">I've been you know I keep saying this to everybody but nobody believes me you know I have <trunc>n</trunc> I have a very flat back which is an indicator of how stiff I am and I can't rotate in any</u>
<u n="58" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="59" who="S0293"><unclear/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0282"><vocal desc="laugh"/> in any dimension</u>
<u n="61" who="S0293">in any way no I can't and I keep saying this to people and I know you know it's not a a major thing but it it makes life quite hard work and also things like I fall off my bike I fall over I I er cos I can't bend to get out of situations</u>
<u n="62" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0293" trans="overlap">I'm all so it's actually quite</u>
<u n="64" who="S0282">but also if you're <trunc>st</trunc> if you're tense</u>
<u n="65" who="S0293"><unclear>exactly</unclear></u>
<u n="66" who="S0282">then you can't fall properly and you can't correct yourself because you need a certain amount of fluidity and relaxation</u>
<u n="67" who="S0293" trans="overlap">yeah yeah so my daily life is more dangerous as a consequence everything is more dangerous about it so</u>
<u n="68" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0293">erm anyway she <trunc>r</trunc> agreed with me that yes it was a level of stiffness that was really quite acute so I I felt quite kind of you know sometimes they look at you as if you're mad you're saying you're stiff you know oh why are you coming? why are complaining about this? I said you know I just need some exercises I need to know what to do but I have to be very careful cos otherwise I set my back off and if I start doing things that set my back off then I just don't don't do the exercises so erm and then she said with the knee which is even more useful she said the reason I'm er she <trunc>sai</trunc> she reckons with <trunc>s</trunc> the correct exercise plan I may actually be able to stop the knee pain because what's happened is my knee caps have moved outwards</u>
<u n="70" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0293">I guess cos of the back and erm I'm very strong on the outside</u>
<u n="72" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0293">but on the inside and therefore they're not being supported correctly</u>
<u n="74" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="75" who="S0293">so if we can build up muscles here</u>
<u n="76" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0293">actually we could probably physically rectify the stress which is oh I've got arthritis but not very bad arthritis</u>
<u n="78" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="79" who="S0293">so I can probably improve the situation a lot myself</u>
<u n="80" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0293">which is what I wanna do you know?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0293">I'm not saying miraculously cure me I'm saying you know there must be a way of improving life cos again with the knee it's it's incredibly impractical you know you can't get <trunc>dow</trunc> I can't get up and down I can't get out the bath I can't get into my cupboards erm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0282">I've ended up on in a supermarket going to get something off the bottom shelf and thinking I can't get up now <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="85" who="S0293" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0282">and having to put a hand on the floor or on the shelf and <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="87" who="S0293">I can't get up I've fallen over</u>
<u n="88" who="S0282" trans="overlap">pull myself up</u>
<u n="89" who="S0293">erm in the street and not been able to get up you know it's really really embarrassing</u>
<u n="90" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0293">erm and I've been in situations with big steps when I actually just can't get out of the situation I'm thinking oh shit what do I do now? <unclear/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0282">mm could be your feet as well</u>
<u n="93" who="S0293">no no I've been <unclear>down</unclear> that alley</u>
<u n="94" who="S0282">have you?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0293">mm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0282">cos I mean that <trunc>m</trunc>my er the pronation of my knees came out as a consequence of me going to see the podiatrist about pains in my feet and they they they had this little er studio where they made you walk on a treadmill they attached electrodes to your bum and they filmed you erm at the same time so they could see so they could see what your feet were doing your knees your thighs your bum and so I was all one side so one buttock higher than the other my knees were pointing outwards my toes were pointing inwards</u>
<u n="97" who="S0293">yeah but I don't know about you but didn't they just give you thick insoles which you can't get in any shoes you see that's what they did with me</u>
<u n="98" who="S0282">ah they gave me a thick pair of insoles which I can er wear in one pair of shoes and when I have pains in my feet I wear those shoes and if I'm walking a lot or</u>
<u n="99" who="S0293" trans="overlap">oh you see I do have pain I do have pain but a very high arch it's which is the problem</u>
<u n="100" who="S0282">oh I have the opposite I have really low arches</u>
<u n="101" who="S0293" trans="overlap">mm mine are exceptionally high <unclear/> exceptionally high arches so and very high feet er <trunc>m</trunc>my feet are you know very solid and sort of high so but I can't get anything in I can't get them in any shoe even walking shoes so you know it's no bloody good</u>
<u n="102" who="S0282">I think the only way you can go from there is to actually have your shoes made and have them made so that they're the right shape for you</u>
<u n="103" who="S0293">oh mm well my mum's been down this <trunc>ba</trunc> cos we've all got my mum's feet basically</u>

<u n="379" who="S0293">yeah it is and she's very dismissive of it but that's cos she's so pliant about the money she gets terribly worried about paying out money I mean that's part of the problem I have with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is she tries to economise on things so for example reeds she won't buy enough reeds and then she runs out and then <unclear>they're like</unclear></u>
<u n="380" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="381" who="S0293">and you can't order them or she won't do the coaching cos she says it's too expensive or she won't take she hasn't got enough money on her therefore she ends up at a station without enough train fare to get home that kind of thing that kind of thing happens to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> quite a bit</u>
<u n="382" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="383" who="S0293">cos she's so busy trying to save money it doesn't doesn't help really</u>
<u n="384" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="385" who="S0293">a good good attitude but it just doesn't help in the long run like she wouldn't have any money in her account like I like to have a hundred pounds in her account for when she needs money urgently for an audition or reeds or something turns up and otherwise I have to be available at <unclear/> precisely that moment lots of things have deadlines you know you've got to be able to do it sometimes and she wouldn't have it her account and of course we just ended up with me having to do three very complicated transfers against the clock and I'm thinking you know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> if you'd only had the bloody money</u>
<u n="386" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="387" who="S0293">it would've been an awful lot easier for all of us</u>
<u n="388" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="389" who="S0293">erm but anyway we'll see</u>
<u n="390" who="S0282">mm so where is she at school at the moment?</u>
<u n="391" who="S0293">yeah she's got an orchestra course she's doing they're doing this concert actually and erm in <anon type="place"/> a symphony concert on Sunday they've got a course and then she goes off to this holiday that we totally disapprove of to Spain without her oboe and without her text books</u>
<u n="392" who="S0282">oh right oh yes</u>
<u n="393" who="S0293">with the girl who's got her place in the orchestra</u>
<u n="394" who="S0282">oh</u>
<u n="395" who="S0293">so yes so we</u>
<u n="396" who="S0282">do you think their friendship will survive this?</u>
<u n="397" who="S0293"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s quite generous about it actually she <trunc>f</trunc> she couldn't talk to her for a day but she seems to have worked it out</u>
<u n="398" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="399" who="S0293">but then er the girl worked out why <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was so upset it's funny isn't it? that's she's slightly she slightly caught cold she didn't work that bit out I guess if you haven't been in a I dunno I don't know why she hadn't worked out how erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> couldn't care about anything else except <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="400" who="S0282">oh no <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="401" who="S0293">it's funny but er</u>
<u n="402" who="S0282" trans="overlap">that's er</u>
<u n="403" who="S0293">anyway her teacher her teacher was very good and</u>
<u n="404" who="S0282" trans="overlap">poor kid</u>
<u n="405" who="S0293">her old teacher was really good she we brilliant actually she couldn't couldn't get hold of her teacher this is when you realise they're such fantastic human beings she couldn't get hold of her current teacher so she rang up her old teacher and she's so brilliant at sort of putting it all in perspective and being sensible about it and calming <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> down and understanding the realities of it all she was absolutely fantastic</u>
<u n="406" who="S0282">that's good I mean will will it help that she did it for a year?</u>
<u n="407" who="S0293">oh yeah yeah no it does help yes you can two years</u>
<u n="408" who="S0282">you can you can you can present it that actually for <trunc>person</trunc>personal reasons she couldn't do it <unclear/></u>
<u n="409" who="S0293">you wouldn't want you couldn't lie cos they all they work with these people er all the time people would be able to tell</u>
<u n="410" who="S0282">well in which case everybody will know that there was a change of policy or that there was a decision made so</u>
<u n="411" who="S0293" trans="overlap">well no it wasn't exactly it wasn't as it's not as clear as that they never tell you er it's a very strange email they send through they <trunc>ne</trunc> they're never really clear of the reason</u>
<u n="412" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="413" who="S0293">so they said it's a <trunc>e</trunc> it's a general email they sent through saying that they had to balance er that first and foremost it's the erm <trunc>ha</trunc> er it is does on merit it's meritocratic <trunc>how</trunc> <trunc>how</trunc> the best the person gets the best position however this is balanced out with how this has to be balanced with how much each person would get from continuing in the orchestra so there has to be a balance of whether they feel that she would get enough from continuing in the orchestra or whether somebody else who hadn't been in it before would gain more and I can understand that if you're a <trunc>s</trunc> equal standard</u>
<u n="414" who="S0282">that's very weasely</u>
<u n="415" who="S0293">it's very weasely it basically gives them</u>
<u n="416" who="S0282">and how are they to say? erm I suppose that that you know that's kind of sop cos you're <trunc>s</trunc> then you're supposed to conclude well actually I'm so good now and I've progressed so much</u>
<u n="417" who="S0293">it's weasely</u>
<u n="418" who="S0282">that actually I've got eighty per cent of the value I can get out of this and another year would only give me another twenty per cent and therefore somebody else would</u>
<u n="419" who="S0293">but then on the other hand they're saying it's completely meritocratic</u>
<u n="420" who="S0282">yes</u>
<u n="421" who="S0293">so it's not really it's <trunc>i</trunc></u>
<u n="422" who="S0282">no it's not meritocratic is it?</u>
<u n="423" who="S0293">no</u>
<u n="424" who="S0282">how can?</u>
<u n="425" who="S0293"><unclear/></u>
<u n="426" who="S0282">no it's either meritocratic or it isn't you can't have meritocratic er mitigated with some other factor</u>
<u n="427" who="S0293">exactly</u>
<u n="428" who="S0282">because then it's it's</u>
<u n="429" who="S0293">yeah er but er it it er <anon type="place"/> is renowned I mean Paul Daniel who is most famous oboist there is never got in to <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="430" who="S0282">really?</u>
<u n="431" who="S0293">yes</u>
<u n="432" who="S0282"><unclear/></u>
<u n="433" who="S0293">and erm er we know many stories whereby a teacher would say this is the most definitely will get in this person hasn't got a cat's chance in hell and then that person that hasn't got a cat's chance in hell will get the position and the other one won't so it is very idiosyncratic</u>
<u n="434" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm yes</u>
<u n="435" who="S0293">they never give you any rationale you never know what's really happened there's quite a lot about personality in fact <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> got on very well with this tutor but I don't think she's she had a terrible injury so I don't think she'd seen much of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> er operating so she probably didn't realise how serious she was erm it's a variety of things there always are always are a variety of things</u>
<u n="436" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="437" who="S0293">I mean if <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> er when she got chucked out it was for very good reason and er but we were very lucky cos he felt so bad <pause dur="short"/> well <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s teacher knew him very well and and he she made him ring her up and that was brilliant because he said you know you didn't know the pieces well enough you you <trunc>y</trunc> and she was she was <trunc>l</trunc> she didn't</u>
<u n="438" who="S0282">she was winging it again</u>
<u n="439" who="S0293" trans="overlap">practise it she was winging it yeah</u>
<u n="440" who="S0282"><vocal desc="misc"/> yes</u>
<u n="441" who="S0293">and and you know that was a reality to that and it it was a terrible shock but er you know there was some reality to it</u>
<u n="442" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="443" who="S0293">erm anyway <unclear/></u>
<u n="444" who="S0282">I don't know perhaps it's better if you have an experience like that somewhere along the line when you</u>
<u n="445" who="S0293">it is you have to have it you have to have it</u>
<u n="446" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm so it just teaches you what happens</u>
<u n="447" who="S0293">well you have to <unclear>be</unclear></u>
<u n="448" who="S0282" trans="overlap">when you don't</u>
<u n="449" who="S0293">you have to be robust enough to deal with the knocks you can't be a musician and many many good musicians fall by the way at this stage</u>
<u n="450" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="451" who="S0293">or at music college cos they can't can't cope with the rejection if they've always been the best</u>
<u n="452" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="453" who="S0293">and suddenly they start getting knocks</u>
<u n="454" who="S0282">but then on the other hand this is where it starts getting serious because it's <trunc>y</trunc>you know beyond a certain age nobody's going to stand up and clap you and beam all over their face and be pleased to see you standing on a stage just cos you're you as your parents and your friends and your aunties and uncles et cetera would do you know you become just another musician in an orchestra one of however many perhaps you're cannon fodder you're certainly paid a shitty amount of money you know and actually the reality of being a musician as an adult is is you're not a gilded youth any more at all you're a hack</u>
<u n="455" who="S0293">no no no</u>
<u n="456" who="S0282">and the transition from gilded youth to hack must also be</u>
<u n="457" who="S0293" trans="overlap">it's a really rough transition</u>
<u n="458" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="459" who="S0293">it's really rough and and and interestingly now I've gone through it with the kids I think it's more interesting because <pause dur="short"/> they are trained to such a high level and they dedicate themselves from such a young age all of these kids will've been practising serious amounts of time from fourteen onwards</u>
<u n="460" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="461" who="S0293">you know it's they are adults in their playing</u>
<u n="462" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="463" who="S0293">from the age of fourteen onwards</u>
<u n="464" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="465" who="S0293">and then as you say they just become any old hack who's sort of hired for a pittance to do you know play a tune <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="466" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm yes</u>
<u n="467" who="S0293">and it <unclear/></u>
<u n="468" who="S0282">and nobody notices you again and actually you're probably sitting in the dark most of the time</u>
<u n="469" who="S0293">yeah</u>
<u n="470" who="S0282">cos erm you know you're just you're just at the back and super you know just I don't know just</u>
<u n="471" who="S0293">well that's why <unclear/></u>
<u n="472" who="S0282" trans="overlap">you might as well be playing the triangle or something ping</u>
<u n="473" who="S0293">but it's a society unto itself I think the musicians all appreciate each each other so <unclear/></u>
<u n="474" who="S0282">oh yeah there must be a benefit there must be a benefit to it I mean I suppose I don't know <unclear>perhaps is it a bit like being</unclear> an artist? or?</u>
<u n="475" who="S0293" trans="overlap">yes it is an artist</u>
<u n="476" who="S0282">any any other kind of performing really that that actually the comradeship of your peers and being part of the little</u>
<u n="477" who="S0293" trans="overlap">well they know whether you're good or they know whether you're good or not</u>
<u n="478" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah no</u>
<u n="479" who="S0293">and you are creating music and er you know you know whether you're doing it well or not <unclear/> about personal satisfaction I think</u>
<u n="480" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="481" who="S0293">for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you know like with er with the <anon type="place"/> she actually really didn't care whether she got through or not all she cared about was whether she felt she had done her best</u>
<u n="482" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="483" who="S0293">it was about it was a personal thing</u>
<u n="484" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="485" who="S0293">it was <unclear/> she could stand up in front of her contemporaries and feel pride in what she had produced and she could and that's it wasn't anything to do with anybody else <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's just whether she could actually say she actually played like she wanted to</u>
<u n="486" who="S0282">yeah and what was really nice when we went to that concert is other people seeing other people around going oh that's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> oh that's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and coming up and saying oh hello <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="487" who="S0293"><unclear>what was that one</unclear>?</u>

<u n="516" who="S0282">mm they were down at our house the other day mending the boiler again again something else went wrong but it's a three-way valve and they always go wrong it's very boring indeed it drives me bonkers you wake up in the middle of the night and you think what's that noise? you think it's the boiler what is the what time is it? <unclear/> why is the boiler going? and of course because it's the the valve has blocked it's still just going like billy-o and it's the middle of the night and all the radiators are boiling hot and the water is piping hot and everything and it won't switch itself off because the valve is stuck in the open position it's really frustrating</u>
<u n="517" who="S0293">mm mm yeah they are annoying we when we do the kitchen we need a new boiler I guess <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will talk to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <unclear/></u>

<u n="523" who="S0293"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> saw the builder but he can't do us till next year so I don't think any builder's going to be able to do us until next year <unclear/></u>
<u n="524" who="S0282">oh it's frustrating isn't it?</u>
<u n="525" who="S0293">to be honest there's quite a few things we have to do ourselves and we're not progressing with those you know we've got to change some guttering we've got to move a flower bed we've got to empty the sheds get rid of the sheds you know there's quite a lot of stuff we have to do</u>
<u n="526" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="527" who="S0293">which erm we're not really addressing at the moment we've got to get</u>
<u n="528" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no it's very frustrating</u>
<u n="529" who="S0293" trans="overlap">skips in and we've got to actually</u>
<u n="530" who="S0282">it's very satisfying getting a skip</u>
<u n="531" who="S0293">I know well I want to get one now cos it's the only way I'm going to get <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to empty the bloody sheds and we've got just we've emptied <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s loft which is a huge <unclear/> and to be fair to him he did it himself erm which was well <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> helped him</u>
<u n="532" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="533" who="S0293">erm but that is a huge relief cos we did a whole load of old carpets and god knows what else <unclear/></u>
<u n="534" who="S0282">oh that's terrible and you imagine that they're still gonna be alright and you look at them and you think <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="535" who="S0293">they probably would've been alright but you know there comes a point when you just don't have the will to lay these things do you?</u>
<u n="536" who="S0282">no and actually also we rolled up the carpet in one room in our house to put to to put the wardrobe in new wardrobe what I didn't realise is once you've rolled up the carpet the last thing you should do is walk on it because when the guy came round and I said oh can you relay that carpet he said no I can't cos it's all creased up if I lay it now you're gonna have to call me back in about three weeks' time because when all the creases have have unfolded from it again it will be too loose so therefore you have to lay it back down and not pin it down for the next sort of three or four weeks and when call me back after that when all the creases have gone and then I'll then I'll pin it back down again</u>
<u n="537" who="S0293">mm</u>
<u n="538" who="S0282">that and he sort of said has anybody been <trunc>wor</trunc> walking on there so <unclear/> said er er well yeah didn't realise we weren't supposed to so so it's <trunc>ve</trunc> so once they've been rolled up in the loft for however long I would imagine they're never gonna lie flat again actually</u>
<u n="539" who="S0293">no</u>
<u n="540" who="S0282">they're not rolled down to a piece of cardboard like they were in the first place</u>
<u n="541" who="S0293">no</u>
<u n="542" who="S0282">they're just sort of sloppily thrown up there likewise lino</u>
<u n="543" who="S0293">and the other thing well <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s friends have just been sleeping on them and <unclear/> sleeping on em</u>
<u n="544" who="S0282">oh yeah</u>
<u n="545" who="S0293">but erm the other thing is I suspect this bloody project is gonna end up er exponentially must more expensive than we'd anticipated</u>
<u n="546" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="547" who="S0293">because actually when it comes to it <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s beginning to realise that he can't do certain things himself and he hasn't got he just hasn't got the time</u>
<u n="548" who="S0282">is that his knees as well?</u>
<u n="549" who="S0293">it's just time hasn't go the time erm</u>
<u n="550" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="551" who="S0293">you know er</u>
<u n="552" who="S0282">er <unclear/> I was gonna say earlier as well is have you do you ever have massages? cos er if you had massages that I think that would help as well</u>
<u n="553" who="S0293">I don't find anybody I trust cos the cos I've had a back problem I'd only want to do it with somebody I really trust for massage</u>
<u n="554" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="555" who="S0293">I wouldn't go for a general massage cos some people can <trunc>bu</trunc>bugger me up</u>
<u n="556" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0293">and there are people that that are good but I would only go on personal recommendation</u>
<u n="558" who="S0282">yeah no quite but I was wondering if that might help really</u>
<u n="559" who="S0293">it's expensive expensive <unclear/></u>
<u n="560" who="S0282">yeah all these things are expensive</u>

<u n="789" who="S0293">well I quite understand that <unclear/></u>
<u n="790" who="S0282" trans="overlap">and stuff like that but because I didn't have a hospital appointment on Monday</u>
