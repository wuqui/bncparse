<u n="316" who="S0559">yeah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0543">it's basically just reading one book for each language and then the other one is very it's an empirical one where I just have to do loads of data so</u>

<u n="319" who="S0543" trans="overlap">it shouldn't be too I have to compare it to a theory but it shouldn't be too bad it's just the sociology one</u>
