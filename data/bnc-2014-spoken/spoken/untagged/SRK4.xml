<u n="59" who="S0024">yeah well he must be though because I don't think this job is shit and I feel like I've worked</u>
<u n="60" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm I mean there is parts of it that's a bit er <unclear/></u>
<u n="62" who="S0144" trans="overlap">no I'm really happy with this job</u>
<u n="63" who="S0024">yeah I'm happy with what I teach them too I feel like I'm er I am teaching them the structure of essays and I am teaching</u>
<u n="64" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0024">I feel like I'm helping them</u>
<u n="66" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0024">but some people think that it's just</u>
<u n="68" who="S0144">just a shitty dossy job</u>
<u n="69" who="S0024">that it's shit and we're not teaching them anything</u>
<u n="70" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="71" who="S0024">that really really <unclear>gets me</unclear></u>
<u n="72" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I think it's what you make of it isn't it? but</u>
<u n="73" who="S0024">huh?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0144">it's what you put into it</u>
<u n="75" who="S0024">yeah but then <pause dur="short"/> they all end up with the same grades anyway</u>
<u n="76" who="S0144">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0024">because the marking schemes everybody gets like <pause dur="short"/> they only fail if they're really shit they only get really great if they're all of the middle ground they all get fifty-sixty percent er <pause dur="short"/> doesn't make any difference</u>
<u n="78" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well yeah no cos that's all education is it's just a money making scheme <pause dur="short"/> there's too much impetus on the teachers I think <pause dur="short"/> I'd say ninety percent of it comes down to the student's motivation</u>
<u n="79" who="S0024">no but I I feel like I <trunc>tea</trunc> I really help them</u>
<u n="80" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah yeah I do</u>
<u n="81" who="S0024" trans="overlap">by teaching them different things that if if a teacher didn't bother with</u>
<u n="82" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0024">then</u>
<u n="84" who="S0144">yeah I feel like that</u>
<u n="85" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I don't understand</u>
<u n="86" who="S0144" trans="overlap">as well</u>
<u n="87" who="S0024" trans="overlap">why my students don't do better than those</u>
<u n="88" who="S0144">I feel like that as well but then on the other side of that you've got things like what we were doing the other week with er presentations showing them bad examples you know where you've got I don't know grey writing on dark grey writing on a black background</u>
<u n="89" who="S0024">and the students do exactly</u>
<u n="90" who="S0144">and everyone in class when you were showing that they were laughing going oh ha ha you know</u>
<u n="91" who="S0024">yeah that's it</u>
<u n="92" who="S0144" trans="overlap">that's funny and then lo and behold when they give their presentations <vocal desc="laugh"/> you've got fucking rainbows and yellow writing and it's like what the fuck? what have I been teaching you? I mean</u>
<u n="93" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0144">that's just pure laziness on their I mean they <pause dur="short"/> could you grab me one?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0024">yeah bit sad isn't it?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0144">so I mean how much <pause dur="short"/> of what I'm saying is actually going in? or how much</u>
<u n="97" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0144" trans="overlap">are they just sat there going through the motions but not actually paying attention? I dunno</u>
<u n="99" who="S0024">they say to me that they are but then <unclear/> but</u>
<u n="100" who="S0144">yeah some of them <pause dur="short"/> I mean some of them are really smart right? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="101" who="S0024">but the marking it's it's like the <trunc>ess</trunc> exams it's just a joke</u>
<u n="102" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0024">it is a joke because even I'm gonna do it now sit there and work out exactly what people have got for their <trunc>e</trunc> like be really careful about <pause dur="short"/> fifty-sixty percent</u>
<u n="104" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0024">if I was at uni I'd be gutted if I got fifty-five but most of these kids are gonna get fifty-five <pause dur="short"/> just because the markers can't be bothered to</u>
<u n="106" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0024">decide <pause dur="short"/> whether they'll get a sixty-five there's a massive difference between a fifty-five and a sixty-five <pause dur="short"/> even the examiners go oh it doesn't matter it doesn't make an difference to them</u>
<u n="108" who="S0144">well it doesn't in the sense that it's a foundation so it's not going towards any overall mark is it? it's just getting them on to the next year</u>
<u n="109" who="S0024">well</u>
<u n="110" who="S0144" trans="overlap">any marks than that it's the top ten percent</u>
<u n="111" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0144" trans="overlap">who'll get the scholarships <pause dur="short"/> or maybe it's not top ten is it? it's the top <pause dur="short"/> it's the top ten students or something</u>
<u n="113" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah but even the top <pause dur="short"/> even if they write something really well the examiner could disagree</u>
<u n="114" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0024">and just <pause dur="short"/> too tired</u>
<u n="116" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="117" who="S0024">too tired</u>
<u n="118" who="S0144" trans="overlap">there are such problems cos I mean I never give over seventy well I very rarely</u>
<u n="119" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0144">I think about seventy-five is the highest I've given and</u>
<u n="121" who="S0024">me too</u>
<u n="122" who="S0144" trans="overlap">you see some people and</u>
<u n="123" who="S0024" trans="overlap">very rarely</u>
<u n="124" who="S0144" trans="overlap">they're doing like eighty-five</u>
<u n="125" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0144" trans="overlap">that's a massive difference</u>
<u n="127" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0144">and what's the difference between a seventy-five and an eighty-five? it gets really complicated <pause dur="short"/> and the same with the lower end as well what's the difference between twenty-five and a thirty-five?</u>
<u n="129" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0144">that's not that's not clear at all</u>
<u n="131" who="S0024">twenty-five and thirty-five? <vocal desc="laugh"/> well they just fail don't they?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0144">well they don't if they get thirty-five they get put through anyway</u>
<u n="133" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
