<u n="199" who="S0589">I enrolled as an English literature student</u>
<u n="200" who="S0588">you see I think you're better off for life purposes doing English language than English literature <pause dur="short"/> english literature is so bloody subjective I actually think that everything that I did was the wrong choice cos I chose really subjective things and actually I should have been choosing stuff that was really there is one answer and one answer only</u>

<u n="255" who="S0589" trans="overlap">haven't you darling?</u>
<u n="256" who="S0588">I mean the thing is my my big sleepless night thing is how much I just fucking should've done music in my lifetime and <pause dur="short"/> cos that that's the thing that I'm best at and I didn't do it so it's my greatest regret but what it takes is parents to sort of totally you know like parents of that violinist</u>
