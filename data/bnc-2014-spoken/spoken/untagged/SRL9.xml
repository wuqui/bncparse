<u n="2375" who="S0588" trans="overlap">but actually in your area that would</u>
<u n="2376" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2377" who="S0588">work fine because</u>
<u n="2378" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="2386" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah you see that means we only get bottles for instance collected once a fortnight and in a fortnight we collect <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2387" who="S0588">quite a few bottles <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2388" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah we occasionally pass them up to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s house actually when they're</u>
<u n="2389" who="S0588"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2390" who="S0590">the collection's due so</u>
<u n="2391" who="S0588">sneaky</u>

<u n="2393" who="S0588"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2394" who="S0590">or <unclear/> just</u>
<u n="2395" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it's embarrassing</u>
<u n="2396" who="S0590"><trunc>sh</trunc>she just has a she has just as many as us and of course periodically we go to the dump</u>
<u n="2397" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="2398" who="S0590">most people go to the dump with an awful lot of stuff</u>
<u n="2399" who="S0588">mm <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="2400" who="S0590">but again it goes back to what we were talking about last night the <trunc>initia</trunc> individual's responsibility they don't</u>
<u n="2401" who="S0588" trans="overlap">well again</u>
<u n="2402" who="S0590">they they don't think</u>
<u n="2403" who="S0588" trans="overlap">that's another one it's like</u>
<u n="2404" who="S0590" trans="overlap">you know they put it in a bucket and it goes</u>
<u n="2405" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah someone deals with it</u>
<u n="2406" who="S0590" trans="overlap">end of it</u>
<u n="2407" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="2408" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah well god knows we're all responsible for our</u>
<u n="2409" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2410" who="S0588">but that's also the supermarket's fault and the culture of wrapping everything up</u>
<u n="2411" who="S0590">yeah well they've done well with the plastic bag</u>
<u n="2412" who="S0588" trans="overlap">and the packaging culture yeah</u>
<u n="2413" who="S0590">business actually</u>
<u n="2414" who="S0588" trans="overlap">at least that's one thing that I can say</u>
<u n="2415" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2416" who="S0588">that this government that's done that's good</u>
<u n="2417" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2418" who="S0588">only one thing that I can think of</u>
<u n="2419" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2420" who="S0588">that was of benefit</u>
<u n="2421" who="S0590"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2422" who="S0588">to the earth</u>
<u n="2423" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2424" who="S0588">or life in general is that</u>
<u n="2425" who="S0590">plastic bags</u>
<u n="2426" who="S0588" trans="overlap">really and <trunc>peo</trunc> making people aware that this is not free</u>
<u n="2427" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2428" who="S0588">it's not free</u>
<u n="2429" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2430" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it doesn't matter if you</u>
<u n="2431" who="S0590">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2432" who="S0588">get given them it's not free</u>
<u n="2433" who="S0590" trans="overlap">mind you we we miss those plastic bags because <trunc>w</trunc>we've always taken our own shoppers always but we did collect plastic bags we use them to line waste paper baskets</u>
<u n="2434" who="S0588">that's what I use them for</u>
<u n="2435" who="S0590" trans="overlap">we use them to collect ash</u>
<u n="2436" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2437" who="S0590">and now we've we've actually had to buy plastic bags</u>
<u n="2438" who="S0588" trans="overlap">well no I've had to actually I've got to buy plastic bags <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2439" who="S0590">yeah in</u>
<u n="2440" who="S0588" trans="overlap">for that</u>
<u n="2441" who="S0590">yes</u>
<u n="2442" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2443" who="S0590">yeah but</u>
<u n="2444" who="S0588" trans="overlap">rather negates the whole point in a way</u>
<u n="2445" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah but certainly all our plastic bags that we got from any supermarket were put to use</u>
<u n="2446" who="S0588">no but the point is</u>
<u n="2447" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2448" who="S0588">it's made people think about it</u>
<u n="2449" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2450" who="S0588">and it's just a bit it's only five P on your shop as well and people are kind of I find that's a bit weird that oh five P oh I'm going to bring a bag</u>
<u n="2451" who="S0590">yes</u>
<u n="2452" who="S0588" trans="overlap">so it obviously that five P has worked really well</u>
<u n="2453" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah because it's quite</u>
<u n="2454" who="S0588" trans="overlap">so it's good cos it's made people</u>
<u n="2455" who="S0590" trans="overlap">you know for one plastic bag it's quite a lot of money</u>
<u n="2456" who="S0588" trans="overlap">think about it but it's just the point of</u>
<u n="2457" who="S0590">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2458" who="S0588" trans="overlap">that fact that you have to pay for it</u>
<u n="2459" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2460" who="S0588">that has got into people's brains</u>
<u n="2461" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2462" who="S0588">and that's good but I personally think it should be fifty P</u>
<u n="2463" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2464" who="S0588" trans="overlap">if you're gonna do that then the cost is whatever that would really work if it was fifty P</u>
<u n="2465" who="S0590">yeah then there would be no no bags</u>
<u n="2466" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah no</u>
<u n="2467" who="S0590">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2468" who="S0588" trans="overlap">you'd never just not forget your bag</u>
<u n="2469" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2470" who="S0588">yeah why not? if you're gonna do that</u>
<u n="2471" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2472" who="S0588">do it all the way</u>
<u n="2473" who="S0590" trans="overlap">because we we occasionally have found out well actually we always keep things in the car big bags in the car but just occasionally we've passed somewhere and spontaneously gone in</u>
<u n="2474" who="S0588">yes exactly</u>
<u n="2475" who="S0590" trans="overlap">and and</u>
<u n="2476" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it's the spontaneous thing</u>
<u n="2477" who="S0590" trans="overlap">had a look and then bought some things and had to</u>
<u n="2478" who="S0588" trans="overlap">that catches you out yeah</u>
<u n="2479" who="S0590" trans="overlap">a plastic bag and it's always been useful because we've always used it</u>
<u n="2480" who="S0588">mm it's always the spontaneous shops</u>
<u n="2481" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2482" who="S0588" trans="overlap">that catch me out <pause dur="short"/> but the trick is to always have one in your handbag a carrier bag in your handbag</u>
<u n="2483" who="S0590" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> keeps one in his pocket</u>
<u n="2484" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="2485" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2486" who="S0588">and I think the most beneficial aspect of the five P charge is it will make people just never go out without a bag</u>
<u n="2487" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2488" who="S0588">and so that must have reduced it</u>
<u n="2489" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2490" who="S0588">quite significantly</u>
<u n="2491" who="S0590">hugely actually</u>
<u n="2492" who="S0588" trans="overlap">by at least</u>
<u n="2493" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2494" who="S0588">a quarter</u>
<u n="2495" who="S0590">yeah well it think</u>
<u n="2496" who="S0588" trans="overlap">I'd have thought</u>
<u n="2497" who="S0590" trans="overlap">much more than that actually really</u>
<u n="2498" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="2499" who="S0590" trans="overlap">because</u>
<u n="2500" who="S0588">probably more</u>
<u n="2501" who="S0590">yeah cos certainly down in our neck of the woods most people go into a shop with bags</u>
<u n="2502" who="S0588">yeah well er I think they probably did anyway</u>
<u n="2503" who="S0590">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="2504" who="S0588" trans="overlap">where you live</u>
<u n="2505" who="S0590">well</u>
<u n="2506" who="S0588" trans="overlap">less so where</u>
<u n="2507" who="S0590" trans="overlap">yeah but of course up here people go <trunc>b</trunc> in their car really? do they?</u>
<u n="2508" who="S0588" trans="overlap">what here?</u>
<u n="2509" who="S0590">yeah</u>
<u n="2510" who="S0588">I don't</u>
<u n="2511" who="S0590" trans="overlap">well no I don't know maybe not</u>
<u n="2512" who="S0588" trans="overlap">no</u>
