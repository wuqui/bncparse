<u n="17" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="long"/> yeah that's what I think as well and then <pause dur="short"/> cos I don't think when you're on a plane you have no sense of how far you go I mean obviously you know how long you're on there for and it was four hours which is quite long but I didn't <trunc>exp</trunc> when they explained <trunc>th</trunc>this erm skin care advisers <trunc>they</trunc>they're like okay even if you've been to Lanzarote before you still need to know the know about the climate here cos we're so close to Africa and you're like what</u>
