<u n="1" who="S0588">it's like an old an old tape recorder so</u>
<u n="2" who="S0613" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh oh that's great isn't it?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0588"><vocal desc="laugh"/> you can't get easier than that really</u>
<u n="4" who="S0613" trans="overlap">there's something rather comforting about that isn't it?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0588" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it is isn't it?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0613" trans="overlap">oh it's going round</u>
<u n="7" who="S0588">yes <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="8" who="S0613" trans="overlap">that means it's yes recording</u>
<u n="9" who="S0588" trans="overlap">press record I'm still in the old-school way of doing things</u>
<u n="10" who="S0613">right so the green light means it's recording?</u>
<u n="11" who="S0588">well it's going round so that always used to mean</u>
<u n="12" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0588">it's recording <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0613">right <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah or some of them yeah the more sophisticated one you had to get a certain coloured light on as well didn't you?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0588">oh I don't know</u>
<u n="16" who="S0613">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0588" trans="overlap">I can't remember but er</u>
<u n="18" who="S0613" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="19" who="S0588">gosh those were the days everything physical none of this digital crap erm yeah stomach enzymes what were we saying? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0613">no you were you were saying that</u>
<u n="21" who="S0588">oh it's very interesting anyway yeah er that you do have some control over it and I know for fact that well <pause dur="short"/> some control over your body there is some control over</u>
<u n="22" who="S0613">yes <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="23" who="S0588" trans="overlap">your body there there definitely is</u>
<u n="24" who="S0613">in everything that you've read though does your as you get older does your body change?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0588">uhu</u>
<u n="26" who="S0613">because something I've noticed I I've suddenly erm I'm definitely getting middle-aged spread</u>
<u n="27" who="S0588">well there's reasons for that and</u>
<u n="28" who="S0613" trans="overlap">well it's my age I should imagine is one of them <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0588">yeah but there's also some control over that as well depending on and I can't remember I've just read the <vocal desc="laugh"/> books on it I can't remember what the thing is that you do but erm that's to do with like sugar levels as well</u>
<u n="30" who="S0613" trans="overlap">what there are certain foods you can eat?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0588">yeah there's all that erm but the worst culprits to simplify it the culprits are sugar alcohol glucose erm probably dairy but I don't think dairy's as bad erm cheese is quite bad but er yeah sugar and alcohol <unclear/></u>
<u n="32" who="S0613" trans="overlap">but that's natural sugars as well you're talking about?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0588">and natural sugars so erm although not nearly as bad but if you were to eat a piece of fruit you've got all the fibre and all the good things as well so that in context is still good</u>
<u n="34" who="S0613" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0588">but if you also mix it with a lunch that has other things that aren't sweet or you can put it in with a savoury thing as well then it doesn't have the bad blood sugar effect</u>
<u n="36" who="S0613" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="37" who="S0588">erm but I know for a fact and how I know for a fact that it has a bearing on one's body what one eats is I get these flabby earlobes I've got flabby earlobe syndrome <vocal desc="laugh"/> and erm it gets kind of lumpy under my ears when I have lots of sugar it gets</u>
<u n="38" who="S0613">really?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0588" trans="overlap">really lumpy yes</u>
<u n="40" who="S0613">god I've never heard of that</u>
<u n="41" who="S0588">yeah that's a fatty thing it's a fatty inflammation thing</u>
<u n="42" who="S0613" trans="overlap">well I've got pierced ears though so maybe would</u>
<u n="43" who="S0588">no</u>
<u n="44" who="S0613">the same thing happen?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0588">no you've got I you've got different earlobes to me so probably not</u>
<u n="46" who="S0613" trans="overlap">so I wouldn't tend to get the syndrome anyway even if</u>
<u n="47" who="S0588">no it's not a syndrome</u>
<u n="48" who="S0613" trans="overlap">it it might</u>
<u n="49" who="S0588" trans="overlap">I've just made up the syndrome</u>
<u n="50" who="S0613"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="51" who="S0588">but I just know that I get flabby earlobes and that's to do with sort of inflammation and deposits of crap and <vocal desc="laugh"/> all sorts</u>
<u n="52" who="S0613" trans="overlap">well I tell what I've noticed I've noticed I'm getting a layer of fat on the back of my neck</u>
<u n="53" who="S0588">well yes it crops up in many strange places yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0613" trans="overlap">which I never used to have I caught sight of myself in a changing room mirror you know when</u>
<u n="55" who="S0588" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0613" trans="overlap">you can see the back of yourself and I suddenly thought</u>
<u n="57" who="S0588">and suddenly the back of you</u>
<u n="58" who="S0613" trans="overlap">I never used to look like that</u>
<u n="59" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0613">I've just this kind of extra layer of fat round there</u>
<u n="61" who="S0588">no it it comes in really strange places and that's to do with your eating as well because it will kind of store things but if you eat it the right way it won't store things erm</u>
<u n="62" who="S0613">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0588" trans="overlap">so there's a very straightforward er scientific thing you can do in around how you eat but the first thing is glucose and sugar and alcohol it really is</u>
<u n="64" who="S0613" trans="overlap">I've always I've always gone before on how I feel rather than how I look</u>
<u n="65" who="S0588">mm</u>
<u n="66" who="S0613">so</u>
<u n="67" who="S0588">looks are quite a good barometer though I find</u>
<u n="68" who="S0613">yeah I mean the fact okay like the an extra layer of fat on the back of my neck er I don't I don't it doesn't I don't feel bad about it other than when I see it</u>
<u n="69" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it doesn't it yeah it yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0613" trans="overlap">and then I go oh that's not very nice <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="71" who="S0588">it doesn't hurt I mean getting erm thing these things</u>
<u n="72" who="S0613" trans="overlap">oh batwings</u>
<u n="73" who="S0588">batwings</u>
<u n="74" who="S0613">yes</u>
<u n="75" who="S0588">that doesn't hurt it's not painful but it's just bloody what the fuck?</u>
<u n="76" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="77" who="S0588"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="78" who="S0613">oh yeah no it's</u>
<u n="79" who="S0588" trans="overlap">because I didn't no I noticed that in my thirties that everything was going a little bit</u>
<u n="80" who="S0613">going south</u>
<u n="81" who="S0588">well just not as er taut and firm as it was so I started exercising straightaway and it sorted it out the only problem is you do have to work you have to keep working hard at it</u>
<u n="82" who="S0613">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0588">but that's the only way</u>
<u n="84" who="S0613">well have you erm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0588" trans="overlap">to keep it at bay</u>
<u n="86" who="S0613">have you ever read interviews with oh god who's this Gillian Lynne? she's a a choreographer but she was a dancer she's now god in er well into her eighties</u>
<u n="87" who="S0588">uhu</u>
<u n="88" who="S0613">erm and she's still dancing she has this</u>
<u n="89" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0613" trans="overlap">regime she gets up every morning</u>
<u n="91" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0613">and she's had two hip replacement operations as well <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="93" who="S0588">mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0613" trans="overlap">but she still does it all</u>
<u n="95" who="S0588">mm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0613">she's absolutely incredible but she says the thing is it gets harder every day</u>
<u n="97" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0613" trans="overlap">it gets harder so it requires more effort</u>
<u n="99" who="S0588">well your body has changed you I think you have to accept that your body's not the same as it was when you were twenty it starts to change in the thirties but it's radically changed by the time you're reached sort of over fifties it really has so you have to adapt and and change your your whole everything really</u>
<u n="100" who="S0613">but it seems to to maintain <trunc>th</trunc> your the physicality you had when you were younger you have to keep</u>
<u n="101" who="S0588">work harder</u>
<u n="102" who="S0613" trans="overlap">work harder</u>
<u n="103" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0613">and that that just <trunc>ge</trunc> you work harder and harder and harder</u>
<u n="105" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0613">as each</u>
<u n="107" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0613">each year goes by</u>
<u n="109" who="S0588">but</u>
<u n="110" who="S0613" trans="overlap">which is kind of there must come a point where you got I just <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="111" who="S0588">no</u>
<u n="112" who="S0613">I can't</u>
<u n="113" who="S0588">not quite because if you do the right sort of exercise you don't have to exert yourself too much it only takes ten minutes a day to keep it all together really</u>
<u n="114" who="S0613">what are you talking about aerobic exercise or?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah yeah or weights are really important cos that kind of makes everything come together again <vocal desc="laugh"/> but erm resistance a little <trunc>b</trunc> a little bit of resistance exercise and a tiny bit of aerobic but not whole cos that's actually really ageing if you do the whole really going for it thing or jogging that's really ageing</u>
<u n="116" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah cos everything just bounces about and it</u>
<u n="117" who="S0588" trans="overlap">and it's just like yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0613" trans="overlap">and you can feel it tugging at your</u>
<u n="119" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah no no don't</u>
<u n="120" who="S0613" trans="overlap">your your everything bouncing and tugging</u>
<u n="121" who="S0588" trans="overlap">don't do it it's</u>
<u n="122" who="S0613">yeah</u>
<u n="123" who="S0588" trans="overlap">just it's the worst</u>
<u n="124" who="S0613">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it's it has to be gentle and no no big er sort of erm bumps or anything like that</u>
<u n="126" who="S0613" trans="overlap">no jerky yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0588" trans="overlap">no jerky stuff</u>
<u n="128" who="S0613">that's why erm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0588" trans="overlap">just really gentle</u>
<u n="130" who="S0613">that's why I love yoga I absolutely adore yoga</u>
<u n="131" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="132" who="S0613">because also it it makes me feel so because it's all you kind of</u>
<u n="133" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0613">go inside yourself and</u>
<u n="135" who="S0588" trans="overlap">well it opens up all the energy blocked energy things and then everything starts flowing energetically nicely between the body and that's what you ultimately really so that's lovely I don't think though yoga's enough or in itself cos you need just a little bit of sort of resistance and</u>
<u n="136" who="S0613">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0588">erm er <pause dur="short"/> aerobic</u>
<u n="138" who="S0613" trans="overlap">to really make make</u>
<u n="139" who="S0588" trans="overlap">a tiny bit</u>
<u n="140" who="S0613">well something that's making the muscles work hard so that they're</u>
<u n="141" who="S0588" trans="overlap">because they're losing something they're <trunc>lo</trunc> literally losing some whatever it is they're losing so they become weaker</u>
<u n="142" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0588">and that is also the reason why people shrink when they get older as well so <trunc>mas</trunc> muscle mass or <trunc>so</trunc> bone something or other</u>
<u n="144" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="145" who="S0588" trans="overlap">density</u>
<u n="146" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="147" who="S0588">goes</u>
<u n="148" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0588">less and it's all to do with the hormones and everything erm so that that's changed fact that won't you can't change the fact that the body has changed but if you erm do certain sorts of exercises you can kind of slow down the process</u>
<u n="150" who="S0613">mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0588">and feel better really erm so</u>
<u n="152" who="S0613" trans="overlap">is there any more tea in the pot?</u>
<u n="153" who="S0588">yeah and I'll get some milk</u>
<u n="154" who="S0613">I'm gonna put the tea in first I I erm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0588">okay you're a tea first girl</u>
<u n="156" who="S0613" trans="overlap">oh <trunc>t</trunc> yeah cos then you can you can add the milk till it's the right colour</u>
<u n="157" who="S0588">yes true</u>
<u n="158" who="S0613" trans="overlap">if you've already put the milk in there's no going back is there?</u>
<u n="159" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="S0613">sorry do you want some more? or</u>
<u n="161" who="S0588">yeah I've got plenty</u>
<u n="162" who="S0613" trans="overlap">I'll let you do your own</u>
<u n="163" who="S0588">do you want to do it yourself?</u>
<u n="164" who="S0613">yeah I'll do it myself yes it's</u>
<u n="165" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0613">bit easier</u>
<u n="167" who="S0588">but oh I'm absolutely certain that we have some control over it but yeah simple things er which I haven't done in the last few days like I say cos I need to do a whole new shop for vegetables but er sugar alcohol gluten they're the worst but you don't have to come off them completely but just cut down</u>
<u n="168" who="S0613">mm</u>
<u n="169" who="S0588">right</u>
<u n="170" who="S0613">no I guess I should have one one last bash at erm before it all fully falls apart</u>
<u n="171" who="S0588">I don't think it needs to fall apart</u>
<u n="172" who="S0613">it's quite erm it requires er a lot of erm headspace to concentrate on it you know?</u>
<u n="173" who="S0588">it does what er to concentrate on not falling apart?</u>
<u n="174" who="S0613">yes</u>
<u n="175" who="S0588">yes it does it's a whole area of study <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="176" who="S0613">yeah and there's other things <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="177" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0613" trans="overlap">I I <vocal desc="laugh"/> rather be doing to be</u>
<u n="179" who="S0588">but those other things you need a body for and I think it's important to give it head space cos those other things are dependent on your body</u>
<u n="180" who="S0613">yes oh no that is true and it's all linked isn't it? and with your mind and everything else no you are right really</u>
<u n="181" who="S0588">so the body is ultimate <pause dur="short"/> temple?</u>
<u n="182" who="S0613"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I knew you were going to say that <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's going to be said at some point</u>
<u n="183" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it was going there <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="184" who="S0613"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="185" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0613">my body is a temple</u>
<u n="187" who="S0588" trans="overlap">so it it all comes through your body all the creativity so without that and if you get ill and stuff <pause dur="short"/> but I dunno I think people are rather passive about it I think there is a lot more that you can do I don't think it's as simple as oh I'm ageing that's that</u>
<u n="188" who="S0613" trans="overlap">so therefore it's all going to yeah</u>
<u n="189" who="S0588" trans="overlap">yeah it's not it there's it's not as straightforward as that</u>
<u n="190" who="S0613">yes I've got a sinking feeling you're probably right and I'm just saying that <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="191" who="S0588">well it's easier to but I mean how great to know that you do have some control over it</u>
<u n="192" who="S0613" trans="overlap">well you have a choice if you if you're</u>
<u n="193" who="S0588">you've got a choice</u>
<u n="194" who="S0613" trans="overlap">if you're prepared to put the time and the energy in</u>
<u n="195" who="S0588">mm</u>
<u n="196" who="S0613" trans="overlap">you you can</u>
<u n="197" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0613">to a certain extent erm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0588">uhu it is to an extent but you can actually feel better <pause dur="short"/> for it you can feel younger and feel better just healthier or whatever it is</u>
<u n="200" who="S0613" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="387" who="S0588">no but a sense of it</u>
<u n="388" who="S0613" trans="overlap">but that kind of idea of it being a chemical imbalance in your brain</u>

<u n="398" who="S0613">yeah but you get the sort of sense of watching yourself</u>
<u n="399" who="S0588">mm</u>
<u n="400" who="S0613">and and I became terribly aware of <trunc>s</trunc> the stuff the what I was doing that that wasn't wasn't healthy or good for for me or those people around me or anything and then and yet still doing it it was almost like this sort of lemming mentality <vocal desc="laugh"/> <trunc>whi</trunc> was</u>
<u n="401" who="S0588">yes and</u>
<u n="402" who="S0613" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="403" who="S0588">it's extra effort to stop doing it because you can see what you're doing and <pause dur="short"/> it it and but with a little helping hand you can stop doing it <vocal desc="laugh"/> like an antidepressant or whatever it is</u>
<u n="404" who="S0613" trans="overlap">yeah I suppose it's yes you</u>
<u n="405" who="S0588" trans="overlap">but erm</u>

<u n="409" who="S0588">mm</u>

<u n="413" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="414" who="S0613" trans="overlap">it's when you're in the middle of the er <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>

<u n="416" who="S0613">but erm</u>
<u n="417" who="S0588">but erm interesting because it makes you think about our mother and she she probably menopausal for years and wouldn't even have</u>
