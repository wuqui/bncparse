<u n="680" who="S0192">but a computer wouldn't be able to pick that up and you'd have to have it so updated all of the time with everything they really need still humans analysing this and as well problem again with the computer is with homophony or homonym where a word has the same pronunciation but a different meaning and how would a computer be able to pick up whether I'm talking about a bat or a bat?</u>
<u n="681" who="S0189">mm</u>
<u n="682" who="S0192">it would have to understand the entire context of the sentence</u>

<u n="724" who="S0191">now</u>
<u n="725" who="S0192">okay three last corpus they made was they got three hundred million words is the last corpus so that was all writing <pause dur="short"/> so they use it they use the written corpus for things like if you go on the website</u>
<u n="726" who="S0191" trans="overlap">what was it?</u>
<u n="727" who="S0189">it was about eight seconds</u>

<u n="734" who="S0192">they erm you'll go on the computer programme and you'll type in a phrase an idiom a lexeme or something or other and then the machine will tell you how common it is or like other random statistics so then they use it for ELT books that's how they make their money because then they make five so close one more time and I think you can do it in three</u>
<u n="735" who="S0191"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="736" who="S0192">give it a try</u>
<u n="737" who="S0189">It's actually about ten</u>
<u n="738" who="S0192">so they use it in ELT books so it will say in the ELT book it will say a phrase and it will say according to the Cambridge Corpus this is the tenth most used phrase in such and such so <trunc>s</trunc> native and non-native speakers can feel confident knowing that we native speakers use these words</u>
<u n="739" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="740" who="S0192">you know what I mean? that they're common in <unclear/></u>
<u n="741" who="S0189">careful <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="742" who="S0192">so I guess they will make money off this somehow</u>
<u n="743" who="S0189">yeah</u>

<u n="745" who="S0191" trans="overlap">what was it?</u>
<u n="746" who="S0192">part of the consensus that they can it can be replayed in other places</u>
<u n="747" who="S0191">what was it?</u>
<u n="748" who="S0192">so you could find you get put in a textbook somewhere you know what I mean?</u>

<u n="785" who="S0192" trans="overlap">problem is I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s got to come and it's makes it really really difficult</u>
<u n="786" who="S0189">why does he have to come?</u>
<u n="787" who="S0192">I don't know unless he stays with you</u>
<u n="788" who="S0189">mm</u>
<u n="789" who="S0192">yeah that's exactly it and then it kind of makes it difficult to record when he's there</u>
<u n="790" who="S0191">I wanna come</u>
<u n="791" who="S0192">I know you wanna come</u>
<u n="792" who="S0189">do they need like child data?</u>
<u n="793" who="S0192">no actually you're not meant to record anyone that's less than eighteen and I have to get my mother to write consent for him but in general they don't want people but I can't what can I do about that? there must be a lot of people that have I mean the children are everywhere</u>
<u n="794" who="S0189">mm</u>
<u n="795" who="S0192">you can't really avoid it can you?</u>
<u n="796" who="S0189">no okay so that Dictaphone you've got</u>
<u n="797" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="798" who="S0189">is don't know it looks directional</u>
<u n="799" who="S0192">yeah I think it slightly is I keep trying to point it roughly at people</u>
<u n="800" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="801" who="S0192">pointing at the ceiling at the moment though</u>
<u n="802" who="S0189">yeah cos otherwise it would have it would have to come out of the device</u>
<u n="803" who="S0192">yeah it's picking it up pretty good</u>
<u n="804" who="S0189">mm</u>
<u n="805" who="S0192">it's the sound quality's quite good it's about forty pounds so two hours of recording will pay it off <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s got one too so hopefully she's doing some recordings</u>
<u n="806" who="S0189">that's good a Sony</u>
<u n="807" who="S0192">yeah <pause dur="short"/> obviously don't press any buttons</u>
<u n="808" who="S0189">no I won't</u>
<u n="809" who="S0192">we're getting on for an hour</u>
<u n="810" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="811" who="S0192">I pause it as well I paused it earlier while I was eating and then un-paused it I made sure that I stopped talking and paused it and then re-started talking and un-paused it but I don't know if that's actually allowed I'm not so I might have to get in contact with them</u>
<u n="812" who="S0189">well during moments of silence I don't see the problem</u>
<u n="813" who="S0191">I can get them</u>
<u n="814" who="S0192">no I don't see the problem either</u>
<u n="815" who="S0189">and well I suppose the conversation would suddenly change you know</u>
<u n="816" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="817" who="S0189">or the context and everything changes as well</u>
<u n="818" who="S0192">but it doesn't really <trunc>ch</trunc> that's another thing although I'm just recording it it's not finished then I have to get these forms and then I have to probably <pause dur="short"/> at least briefly listen to it again and it asks me what topics roughly were talked about and it asks me what kind of conversational clues are happening you know is it interrogatives is it questions is it whatever so it's I have to fill out a little bit of paperwork for each one but I mean for eighteen pound an hour</u>
<u n="819" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="820" who="S0192">I can't really complain</u>
<u n="821" who="S0189">are you sure they're not going to like take your MP3 <pause dur="short"/> strip down all the empty space</u>
<u n="822" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="823" who="S0189">and it's actually about four minutes of speaking <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="824" who="S0192">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> they could do couldn't they</u>
<u n="825" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="826" who="S0192">I mean if we deleted all of the er the blank and it can't too much empty space though</u>
<u n="827" who="S0189">oh no</u>
<u n="828" who="S0192">people talk pretty consistently</u>
<u n="829" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="830" who="S0192">I just need to try and record as many people as possible <pause dur="short"/> well obviously if I'm going to be able to make this my proper job <pause dur="short"/> then I'm going to have to be doing a lot of recordings</u>
<u n="831" who="S0189">mm</u>
<u n="832" who="S0192"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I to get the money that we wanted we we gave ourselves a target of a hundred pounds each a week to live off</u>
<u n="833" who="S0189">yeah</u>
<u n="834" who="S0192">while we are here and that means we need to do five hours of recording each week every week</u>
<u n="835" who="S0189">yeah but that's</u>
<u n="836" who="S0192" trans="overlap">until next June</u>
<u n="837" who="S0189">like that's what? forty minutes a day and you're over it</u>
<u n="838" who="S0192">yeah <pause dur="long"/> but it's finding the people you've got to be able to find enough people I mean although I have I can apparently record people an infinite amount of times <pause dur="short"/> I still think that I'd like to make the research as varied as possible therefore I should get as many people as I can so although I will record all of my family and all my friends numerous times I will do probably make an effort to meet with random people that I don't know</u>
<u n="839" who="S0189">it depends how much of a pain these forms are</u>
<u n="840" who="S0192">they're not too bad</u>
<u n="841" who="S0189">no?</u>
<u n="842" who="S0192">it's just like two pages just asks you some basic details I think you hit the nail on the head though going to an old people's home <pause dur="short"/> they like to speak with people</u>
<u n="843" who="S0189">they do</u>
<u n="844" who="S0192">effectively just go and do some volunteering at an old people's home</u>
