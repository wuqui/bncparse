<u n="1" who="S0018">so what did your tutor say?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0125">I'm just going to <trunc>fi</trunc> this is the last page</u>
<u n="3" who="S0018" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="4" who="S0125"><unclear/> easier really</u>
<u n="5" who="S0018">can I pop this on the floor just</u>
<u n="6" who="S0125" trans="overlap">yeah of course <pause dur="short"/> yep help yourself <pause dur="short"/> so my tutor sent me some feedback about um the draft</u>
<u n="7" who="S0018" trans="overlap">uh huh</u>
<u n="8" who="S0125">um and</u>
<u n="9" who="S0018">oh is that what your <trunc>stat</trunc> status update was?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0125">errr</u>
<u n="11" who="S0018">something about thanks for telling me with like twenty-four hours notice that <trunc>m</trunc></u>
<u n="12" who="S0125" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="13" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0125">oh I don't know about that <pause dur="short"/> um yeah so my tutor sent me err feedback on the draft and it's really helpful actually <pause dur="short"/> because I sent it to the one who is not my course director and she is normally quite um restrictive with her comments <pause dur="short"/> she doesn't seem to like to help um people um out that much <pause dur="short"/> but this guy this tutor has given me some really constructive um feedback</u>
<u n="15" who="S0018"></u>
<u n="16" who="S0125">um which has enabled me to um make my final changes to the document and <trunc>o</trunc> go over the word count unfortunately quite a lot <pause dur="short"/> but um quite significantly <pause dur="short"/> but um hopefully with your help I can get it down</u>
<u n="17" who="S0125"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="18" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="19" who="S0125">um</u>
<u n="20" who="S0018" trans="overlap">what kind of feedback did he give you was it</u>
<u n="21" who="S0125">errm</u>
<u n="22" who="S0018">what to add or what to take out or</u>
<u n="23" who="S0125" trans="overlap">he he suggests I actually change the title of the document <pause dur="short"/> which  I don't  I don't agree with <pause dur="short"/> but anyway that's fine</u>
<u n="24" who="S0018">uh huh</u>
<u n="25" who="S0125">he asks me to define whether there's a formal strategy document for a particular question that I'm trying to answer <pause dur="short"/> erm and he my question to him was I'm concerned that it's not critical enough</u>
<u n="26" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="27" who="S0125">in terms of a review <pause dur="short"/> erm but erm he says that his observation is yes you can make it more critical by linking the ideas that I have together <pause dur="short"/> erm and being err creating a stronger argument either by linking them through the report or raising clear questions at the end</u>
<u n="28" who="S0018">okay <pause dur="short"/> do they impose the the title on you?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0125">no no it's my title</u>
<u n="30" who="S0018">oh right and what have you chosen?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0125">um the title of the report is um How do design and cultural values within Nordic design led businesses influence digital and visual communications?</u>
<u n="32" who="S0018" trans="overlap">oh wow</u>
<u n="33" who="S0125">um so I'm looking at a few different things there but I'm looking at communications how they are influenced by design and cultural values</u>
<u n="34" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0125">within a business which happens to be in the Nordic region which happens to be design led</u>
<u n="36" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0125">um and er using the case study of my time spent working at the placement in the in <unclear/></u>
<u n="38" who="S0018" trans="overlap">oh okay so it's not just a report on what you learnt and stuff <pause dur="short"/> it's actually putting it into</u>
<u n="39" who="S0125"><trunc>Its</trunc></u>
<u n="40" who="S0018">an academic <trunc>cont</trunc> well a</u>
<u n="41" who="S0125" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0018">practical context</u>
<u n="43" who="S0125" trans="overlap">yeah it's about um</u>
<u n="44" who="S0018" trans="overlap"><unclear/> critically analysing it</u>
<u n="45" who="S0125" trans="overlap">it's I've I've proposed the piece of work myself so  it's not  it's not in answer to a explicit brief <pause dur="short"/> it's um it's of my own investigation and proposal <pause dur="short"/> so that's what I'm trying to answer</u>
<u n="46" who="S0018">and what did he suggest that you should change the title to?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0125">he suggested um how does <unclear/> the case study  this this  this business <pause dur="short"/> how does <unclear/> erm open brackets a design led Nordic business close brackets use cultural and design values to direct the communications strategy <pause dur="short"/> which I think I don't like because it's moving away slightly from from my original</u>
<u n="48" who="S0018">it is cos yours</u>
<u n="49" who="S0125">proposal</u>
<u n="50" who="S0018">yours isn't just about the design strategy it's about the digital and visual communications</u>
<u n="51" who="S0125">yes yes</u>
<u n="52" who="S0018">hmm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0125">so  I'm not  I'm not obliged to change it that's fine</u>
<u n="54" who="S0018" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0125">and I can ignore it if I choose to <pause dur="short"/> but I think I'm fine with it <pause dur="short"/> I'm not going to start changing the title of a document at the last minute just because I've got one piece of advice telling me to</u>
<u n="56" who="S0018" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0125">when in the whole process of this project which is about six weeks now so far nobody has asked me to change the title and this tutor has seen this document this proposal all the way through the <trunc>pro</trunc> project <pause dur="short"/> so why at the last minute tell me to change it I'm not quite sure</u>
<u n="58" who="S0018">did did he say that it that the title best that this title best suited the content? Because if you changed the title you would imagine that you'd have to rejuggle the content <unclear/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0125" trans="overlap">his his first observation is the title needs to be reviewed to make it more concise without really changing the meaning or scope of the research</u>
<u n="60" who="S0018">oh okay so it's not semantics</u>
<u n="61" who="S0125" trans="overlap">conciseness</u>
<u n="62" who="S0018">it's just making the title shorter but the title that he's suggested is actually changing the focus isn't it?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0125">to me it felt like that <pause dur="short"/> yep <pause dur="short"/> so that's why I'm ignoring it</u>
<u n="64" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="65" who="S0125">yep</u>
<u n="66" who="S0018">yep <pause dur="short"/> good idea</u>
<u n="67" who="S0125"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0018">is there do you want to try and make the title a bit more concise?</u>
<u n="69" who="S0125">no I'm fine with it <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>d</trunc> I'm not bothered <pause dur="short"/> what I'm more bothered about is the conciseness  to the  to the content</u>
<u n="70" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="71" who="S0125">I think that's the more critical</u>
<u n="72" who="S0018" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0125">nature <pause dur="short"/> because it's a a three thousand word report it has to be really concise</u>
<u n="74" who="S0018">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> yes that's sometimes the most difficult thing isn't it</u>
<u n="75" who="S0125">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0018">keeping within the word limit <pause dur="short"/> okay so what when I proofread it what kind of things do you want me to focus on</u>
<u n="77" who="S0125" trans="overlap">erm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0018">in particular</u>
<u n="79" who="S0125">erm like I said before um any instances of repetition <pause dur="short"/> um any um obvious um confusing arguments <pause dur="short"/> erm er anywhere you see that it's not concise <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="80" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah  have you got  have you got somewhere I can</u>
<u n="81" who="S0125" trans="overlap">yeah of course</u>
<u n="82" who="S0018">can write down</u>
<u n="83" who="S0125">here you go <pause dur="short"/> hold on</u>
<u n="84" who="S0018">ooh you've got post its <pause dur="short"/> oh look at <trunc>th</trunc> Ooh look at these post its</u>
<u n="85" who="S0125" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I know</u>
<u n="86" who="S0018">that's amazing</u>
<u n="87" who="S0125" trans="overlap">that's my selection</u>
<u n="88" who="S0018">where did you get that from?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0125">W H Smith's</u>
<u n="90" who="S0018">beautiful <pause dur="short"/> ooh I like it <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Okay so sorry repeat conciseness</u>
<u n="91" who="S0125" trans="overlap">conciseness any repetition</u>
<u n="92" who="S0018">uh huh</u>
<u n="93" who="S0125">um and erm confusing argument</u>
<u n="94" who="S0018" trans="overlap">confusing argument</u>
<u n="95" who="S0125">this is actually <trunc>th</trunc> the diary that I kept when I was there</u>
<u n="96" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="97" who="S0125"><unclear/> reflective diary didn't go that well</u>
<u n="98" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0125">because normally on my reflective diaries I try to leave one page for the day's observation and leave the next page free for returning to that observation <pause dur="short"/> but as you can see on that one it's blank</u>
<u n="100" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="101" who="S0125">so I haven't really reflected on that day</u>
<u n="102" who="S0018" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="103" who="S0125">erm yes <pause dur="short"/> but anyway <trunc>i</trunc> it was a useful tool none the less</u>
<u n="104" who="S0018">is that what your case studies based on notes <pause dur="short"/> observation notes</u>
<u n="105" who="S0125" trans="overlap">erm yeah <pause dur="short"/> the methodology is um er a mixture of traditional case study done through erm a couple of interviews erm er observation <pause dur="short"/> erm it's all qualitative <pause dur="short"/> erm and er then I've added into the mix a little bit of more erm which <trunc>I</trunc> I've used the word holistic</u>
<u n="106" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="107" who="S0125">to describe um my approach <pause dur="short"/> because I wanted to do it ethnographically <pause dur="short"/> however the timescale was too short to do it <pause dur="short"/> it was a four week</u>
<u n="108" who="S0125">what would that mean then?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0018">ethnographic erm is generally widely erm understood as being when a researcher goes into a community or group of people and becomes a native to that group</u>
<u n="110" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0125">erm and</u>
<u n="112" who="S0018" trans="overlap">but you wanted to do <trunc>i</trunc></u>
<u n="113" who="S0125">and  behaves as  behaves as one of them lives with them eats with them works with them <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> but erm er and I wanted  to do that  to do that visually by um taking photographic and video evidence of er erm of of my time in that group <pause dur="short"/> but um I did do this <pause dur="short"/> I did take photographic evidence and I've used quite a bit of it in the report</u>
<u n="114" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="115" who="S0125">it's quite a visual report but um er I don't know erm <trunc>the</trunc> there was some conflict and er it was slightly contentious um argument in er with my um not argument discussion with my um course tutor about using that particular <trunc>meth</trunc> methodology <pause dur="short"/> so I've changed it to case study through um observation</u>
<u n="116" who="S0018" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0125">interview and <trunc>particip</trunc> participatory um observation</u>
<u n="118" who="S0018" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="119" who="S0125">because um I was one of them <pause dur="short"/> I was working for them <pause dur="short"/> rather than a pure um silent observer</u>
<u n="120" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="121" who="S0125">erm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0018">cool <pause dur="short"/> okay so erm well shall I get down to reading it and then we'll have a brainstorm session</u>
<u n="123" who="S0125" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> If you like <pause dur="short"/> shall I give you a highlighter pen? Would that help?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0018">yep probably</u>
<u n="125" who="S0125">erm <pause dur="short"/> it hasn't printed out the um er annotations  to the  to the images <pause dur="short"/> but that's fine cos I'll go through that and sort that</u>
<u n="126" who="S0018" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="127" who="S0125">erm there you go</u>
<u n="128" who="S0018">cool</u>
<u n="129" who="S0125">um what else? <unclear/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> thank you</u>
<u n="130" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> You're welcome <pause dur="short"/> what you gonna do when <trunc>y</trunc> while I'm doing this?</u>
<u n="131" who="S0125">erm just going to work that bit out</u>
<u n="132" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> I'll put my head down and start reading then <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<event desc="recording skips"/>
<u n="133" who="S0125">so what did you think about reading that work?</u>
<u n="134" who="S0018">yeah I thought what what do you mean if it was easy to read or if it answers the question or</u>
<u n="135" who="S0125" trans="overlap">well <pause dur="short"/> I mean no um what what did you actually think of the subject <unclear/> things like that</u>
<u n="136" who="S0018">really interesting</u>
<u n="137" who="S0125" trans="overlap">yeah?</u>
<u n="138" who="S0018" trans="overlap">yeah I thought it was <pause dur="short"/> cos it kind of it does it it goes into stuff that you don't really think about  when you  when you think about a <trunc>comp</trunc> when you haven't studied stuff like this and you see a company and how they're communicating to the audience</u>
<u n="139" who="S0125" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0018">you're the audience but you don't really realise that there is a strategy behind the communication</u>
<u n="141" who="S0125">yeah I think sometimes it's um intrinsic</u>
<u n="142" who="S0018" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0125">or um er sometimes recognised but <trunc>bas</trunc> I think um er what's interesting for me is the comparisons you can draw between this which is talking about communication strategies and um strategies in design management <pause dur="short"/> because um when people talk about design in erm they <trunc>of</trunc> um famous designers like um oh who's the guy that um er German designer that's really famous for designing really simple things? Braun? You know the manufacturer</u>
<u n="144" who="S0018" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0125">braun Braun <pause dur="short"/> um talks about how design should be um effortless you don't even notice it's there</u>
<u n="146" who="S0018" trans="overlap">mm mm yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0125">and um so when you realise that there's a strategy behind something for me it's like the um comparison that I'm drawing is the same as when a designer talks about a <trunc>beau</trunc> a really well functioning um exquisite piece of design that you don't even realise it's been designed and it's designed to function in a certain way <pause dur="short"/> it's the same thing</u>
<u n="148" who="S0018" trans="overlap">mm yeah it's just there <pause dur="short"/> it works <pause dur="short"/> you just don't realise that it's had a lot of thinking put into it <pause dur="short"/> in a way it's like Mad Men <pause dur="short"/> you know when you see behind the scenes of what goes into an advertising campaign</u>
<u n="149" who="S0125" trans="overlap">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0018">it's like you know they <trunc>d</trunc> they think about every single little visual bit of communication</u>
<u n="151" who="S0125" trans="overlap">have you read any of the blog that's on The Guardian website about Mad Men?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0018">er no</u>
<u n="153" who="S0125">you should read it because if you're a fan of it it every episode gets um um dissected</u>
<u n="154" who="S0018">oh yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0125">through the blog and erm you can read about the nuances and the references that you probably didn't realise why they were there</u>
<u n="156" who="S0018">uh huh</u>
<u n="157" who="S0125">um that signify things to do with um a political um occasion or a historical event</u>
<u n="158" who="S0018" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0125">like I thin kin the last episode he <trunc>talk</trunc> he talked about a murder or a murderer in Texas that's where um a famous murderer and he like corrected the pronunciation or <trunc>th</trunc> the um one character er <trunc>D</trunc> Don Draper corrected who's the kind of weasly um character</u>
<u n="160" who="S0018" trans="overlap">oh yeah um</u>
<u n="161" who="S0125">the really annoying one</u>
<u n="162" who="S0018" trans="overlap">Pete Campbell</u>
<u n="163" who="S0125">Pete Campbell <pause dur="short"/> he corrected him because he used the wrong umm name to describe this murderer and so it puts it into the context of the history that's happening at the time</u>
<u n="164" who="S0018" trans="overlap">ah yeah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0125">and that's why you know it sort of adds <pause dur="short"/> but the blog articles are really interesting to read because he explains more about the script</u>
<u n="166" who="S0018" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="167" who="S0125">the scriptwriting and the the production the production values and things like that <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="168" who="S0018">yeah that's really interesting</u>
<u n="169" who="S0125">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0018">no I got into did you watch Lost?</u>
<u n="171" who="S0125">no only the first series really</u>
<u n="172" who="S0018" trans="overlap">really <pause dur="short"/> no I got really into Lost and I spent more time after watching it checking out the different theories of each different episode and um online</u>
<u n="173" who="S0125" trans="overlap">oh did you?</u>
<u n="174" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0125">so people used to write on forums</u>
<u n="176" who="S0018" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0125">or comment on blogs and things about it?</u>
<u n="178" who="S0018" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> and it was all dissecting cos there was a lot of cross referencing <pause dur="short"/> I really liked it because it didn't explicitly make everything very obvious</u>
<u n="179" who="S0125" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="180" who="S0018">it it relied</u>
<u n="181" who="S0125" trans="overlap">no which is a criticism of American um drama or any kind of TV that comes out of America that it's dumbed down</u>
<u n="182" who="S0018">yes <pause dur="short"/> but it yeah I liked the fact that it assumed that its viewer was intelligent and kind of dangled little bits in front of you</u>
<u n="183" who="S0125" trans="overlap">titbits</u>
<u n="184" who="S0018">to see if you could make the connections</u>
<u n="185" who="S0125" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="186" who="S0018">and so it was it's like there was a lot of cross referencing because they were jumping backwards and forwards in time a lot as well</u>
<u n="187" who="S0125">mm</u>

<u n="372" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="373" who="S0125">because <pause dur="short"/> because really you hand in this work you spend a great deal of your time studying but then what have you got to show for it? Cos actually the work is</u>

<u n="378" who="S0018">mm yeah</u>
<u n="379" who="S0125">erm and learn from</u>
<u n="380" who="S0018" trans="overlap">yep definitely</u>
<u n="381" who="S0125">or reflect upon maybe <pause dur="short"/> so when you get  the feedback back  the feedback back</u>
<u n="382" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="383" who="S0125">from your course tutor you can look over what they've said in relation to the piece of work with the actual piece of work in front of you and make more sense of it</u>
<u n="384" who="S0018">true <pause dur="short"/> where will you get it printed?</u>
<u n="385" who="S0125">in town <pause dur="short"/> mailboxes? It's um it's on Colmer Road</u>
<u n="386" who="S0018">is it expensive to <trunc>b</trunc> bind it and</u>

<u n="388" who="S0018">really?</u>

<u n="390" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="391" who="S0125">yeah but I I just I feel like it's worth it because this course it it means a lot to me</u>
<u n="392" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and for the durability if you're going to keep on referring to it <pause dur="short"/> hm <pause dur="short"/> and do you think that once you finish the course and you're out there back again doing the business side of it that you will that there'll be a lot of things that you think oh yes I remember reading something about that what did it <pause dur="short"/> do you think it will be you'll come back and refer to things</u>
<u n="393" who="S0125">hmm</u>
<u n="394" who="S0018">things like that or</u>
<u n="395" who="S0125">I think so <pause dur="short"/> I think also it's about expanding my knowledge like you say and having more references to call upon when you want to try and justify</u>
<u n="396" who="S0018" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="397" who="S0125">a belief that you have in in a business context <pause dur="short"/> it's always a stronger argument if you can back it up with some evidence</u>
<u n="398" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="399" who="S0125">so this is all evidence gathering in a way</u>
<u n="400" who="S0018">Will you do that to the client or  in your own  in your own interests</u>
<u n="401" who="S0125">in my own way of course it will be different because it won't be in an academic context and often it's about smaller pieces of information that you can get across clearly and concisely and easily</u>
<u n="402" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="403" who="S0125">that anybody can understand <pause dur="short"/> but if I have the academic understanding I can transpose it translate it</u>

<u n="406" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="407" who="S0125">so I think that's good <pause dur="short"/> and it makes me feel cleverer</u>

<u n="416" who="S0018">in teaching that er I actually felt it kind of messed with my head after I just competed it and that when I was teaching I was just aware of all the different possible factors or effects and consequences involved in every single step of every single stage of a lesson <pause dur="short"/> that I found it quite overwhelming</u>

<u n="419" who="S0125">that's good</u>
<u n="420" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="421" who="S0125">it's just choosing what information to use isn't it</u>
<u n="422" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="423" who="S0125">and what to discard <pause dur="short"/> like my report</u>
<u n="424" who="S0018" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh no but if you don't have to if it's not like of paramount importance</u>
<u n="425" who="S0125" trans="overlap"></u>
<u n="426" who="S0018">that you cut it down <pause dur="short"/> I mean how many words do you reckon you'll be able to get away with?</u>
<u n="427" who="S0125">it'd be nice to get to three thousand five hundred</u>
<u n="428" who="S0018">and what is it at now?</u>
<u n="429" who="S0125">hmm</u>
<u n="430" who="S0018">it was four thousand four hundred wasn't it?</u>

<u n="671" who="S0125">yeah it should be there then shouldn't it</u>
<u n="672" who="S0018">Cos it</u>
<u n="673" who="S0125"><unclear/></u>
<u n="674" who="S0018">can be quite clunky and it adds extra words to your word count as well</u>
<u n="675" who="S0125">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="676" who="S0018">so or you could say um it is argued that at the beginning of the sentence and then in in <trunc>pa</trunc> er brackets at the end put who it was who stated it and the year <pause dur="short"/> um also you don't need a full stop <pause dur="short"/> this is being really pernickety but you don't need a full stop at the end of the sentence before you open the brackets to put the reference</u>
<u n="677" who="S0125">sure</u>
<u n="678" who="S0018">so I've um scribbled that out on quite a few occasions <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah I didn't <pause dur="short"/> that was more research <pause dur="short"/> that part was</u>
<u n="679" who="S0125">that's to do with my methodology</u>
<u n="680" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="681" who="S0125">it's a challenge <pause dur="short"/> um I'll look at whether I can</u>
<u n="682" who="S0018">maybe cos you've done quite a lot of criticising your design method and suggesting</u>
<u n="683" who="S0125">yeah</u>
<u n="684" who="S0018">findings <pause dur="short"/> maybe that would be a bit you could target to take out <pause dur="short"/> oh these were just a few of the sentences that I thought that by fronting</u>
<u n="685" who="S0125">yeah</u>
<u n="686" who="S0018">the most important bit of the sentence it would be clearer <pause dur="short"/> and it would also um take your word count down <pause dur="short"/> um yeah and I've just um made some of your sentences shorter</u>
<u n="687" who="S0125">yep fine</u>
<u n="688" who="S0018">by splitting them up <pause dur="short"/> although that's not going to help you with the word count but <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> there's nothing else in there thought you could take out</u>
<u n="689" who="S0125">okay fine</u>
<u n="690" who="S0018">or there</u>
<u n="691" who="S0125">I might need to um tidy this bit up <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> okay fine</u>
<u n="692" who="S0018">oh and check that thing that if you um <pause dur="short"/> if it's not actually quoted as a direct reference as a direct quote with speech marks you don't need to put the</u>
<u n="693" who="S0125">okay</u>
<u n="694" who="S0018">the page number <pause dur="short"/> however if it is if it's in <trunc>quo</trunc> if you've paraphrased it I don't think you need the page that it's come from</u>
<u n="695" who="S0125">okay</u>
<u n="696" who="S0018">um <pause dur="short"/>  Um um um um  um <pause dur="short"/> yeah and that was just the thing about if it's not a published source you don't need to reference it</u>
<u n="697" who="S0125" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="698" who="S0018">and just the translated from Finnish as well just stuff like that <pause dur="short"/> it's just adding extra words</u>
<u n="699" who="S0125">yeah</u>
<u n="700" who="S0018">Don't know if it's necessary <pause dur="short"/> er I think I'm</u>
<u n="701" who="S0125">this bit I need to move cos that's kind of like a primary piece of evidence</u>
<u n="702" who="S0018">ah so you put it after the</u>
<u n="703" who="S0125">yeah and also I'm already <trunc>s</trunc> I'm going to say about the approach <pause dur="short"/> I can get rid of that sentence</u>
<u n="704" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="705" who="S0125">right fine</u>
<u n="706" who="S0018">okey dokey <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah  that was a that was a paragraph we talked about though wasn't it</u>
<u n="707" who="S0125">yep</u>
<u n="708" who="S0018">um yeah how come you've got a title here at the <trunc>bot</trunc> top of this</u>
<u n="709" who="S0125">I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> it's fine don't worry</u>
<u n="710" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="711" who="S0125">it's fine <pause dur="short"/> get rid of that</u>
<u n="712" who="S0018">and then</u>
<u n="713" who="S0125">I was thinkng this bit might be a bit big and maybe I can just reduce it</u>
<u n="714" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="715" who="S0125">either by putting more of this into the</u>
<u n="716" who="S0018">un-huh</u>
<u n="717" who="S0125">or um <pause dur="short"/> yeah okay fine</u>
<u n="718" who="S0018">or just cutting it out if it's not</u>
<u n="719" who="S0125">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it demonstrates how that previous point has been applied but I'll just okay</u>
<u n="720" who="S0018">is it part of the ongoing text or is it a caption?</u>
<u n="721" who="S0125">that's a caption <pause dur="short"/> quite a big caption though</u>
<u n="722" who="S0018">that bit's ongoing text?</u>
<u n="723" who="S0125">yep</u>
<u n="724" who="S0018">okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah with the research methodology there was <pause dur="short"/> how long was that supposed to be cos I think it falls more or less</u>
<u n="725" who="S0125">four hundred</u>
<u n="726" who="S0018">more or less falls into the word limit</u>
<u n="727" who="S0125">yep</u>
<u n="728" who="S0018">so I don't think there's a problem with that cutting that bit down <pause dur="short"/> oh the conclusion <pause dur="short"/> I just thought it was maybe a little structured in a bit of a willy nilly</u>
<u n="729" who="S0125">yep</u>
<u n="730" who="S0018">manner <pause dur="short"/> cos it um I think you need to summarise the key points <pause dur="short"/> so what was your question? The question was How do Design and Cultural Values Influence Communications? So actually say it the first sentence through the study I have ascertained that um communications are influenced to a certain extent by design and cultural values such as blah blah blah <pause dur="short"/> just summarise it</u>
<u n="731" who="S0125">yep</u>
<u n="732" who="S0018">and just make it really explicit <pause dur="short"/> cos then you've you've gone <trunc>un</trunc> basically you're saying a lot about how what you do in he future</u>
<u n="733" who="S0125">mm</u>
<u n="734" who="S0018">whereas I think it the booklet it said summarise your main your key points first</u>
<u n="735" who="S0125">yeah okay</u>
<u n="736" who="S0018">um</u>
<u n="737" who="S0125"><unclear/> shorter sentences</u>
<u n="738" who="S0018">I didn't really understand that</u>
<u n="739" who="S0125">that's because that's a piece I've <trunc>jus</trunc> I've just added and hadn't really looked at</u>
<u n="740" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="741" who="S0125">that's it okay</u>
<u n="742" who="S0018">oh and that was that last paragraph that we thought maybe</u>
<u n="743" who="S0125" trans="overlap">yeah that's fine</u>
<u n="744" who="S0018">wasn't necessary</u>
<u n="745" who="S0125">okay <pause dur="short"/> cool</u>
<u n="746" who="S0018">but kudos to you <pause dur="short"/> it's an amazing piece of work woman</u>
<u n="747" who="S0125">really I don't know yet</u>
<u n="748" who="S0018"><unclear/></u>
<u n="749" who="S0125">yes</u>
<u n="750" who="S0018"><unclear/> What you gonna do on it? You gonna read it through again and edit it?</u>
<u n="751" who="S0125" trans="overlap">I'm just going to start editing it now</u>
<u n="752" who="S0018">cool</u>
<u n="753" who="S0125">yeah</u>
<u n="754" who="S0018">right I'll go downstairs for a bit</u>
<u n="755" who="S0125">alright</u>
<u n="756" who="S0018">I'll come back up <pause dur="short"/> if there's anything like if you want to give me any of the pages and say can you keep all the meaning but cut fifty words out of that paragraph I could probably <trunc>re</trunc> I could probably juggle the sentences the words and sentences</u>
<u n="757" who="S0125" trans="overlap">well let me get  let me get through it based on what you've done here and then I'll see what I'm down to and then see how we go from there</u>
<u n="758" who="S0018">okay <pause dur="short"/> coolio coolio</u>
<u n="759" who="S0125">okay</u>
