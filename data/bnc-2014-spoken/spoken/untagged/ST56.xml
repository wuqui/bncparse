<u n="62" who="S0024">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0144">I thought clay was supposed to hold water</u>
<u n="64" who="S0024">yeah that's what we thought when we dug it <pause dur="short"/> it's all clay soil around here <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> and mum and dad they <trunc>pa</trunc> paddled <pause dur="short"/> is it paddle it? You know like like you do with grapes but you do with a bottom of a pond</u>
<u n="65" who="S0144">oh I don't know</u>
<u n="66" who="S0024">paddle it <pause dur="short"/> poddle it <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="67" who="S0144">poddle it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0024">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> pondle it <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/>  <pause dur="short"/> you know they get their wellies and they like squelching it around to try and make a seal  with the  with the clay</u>
<u n="69" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and it hasn't worked</u>
<u n="70" who="S0024">it doesn't want to take <pause dur="short"/> but it it is getting a little bit more water every year but maybe it's cos of the drought</u>
<u n="71" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> What  half a  half a centimetre</u>
<u n="72" who="S0024">hm <pause dur="short"/> well there was quite a bit in there the other day</u>
<u n="73" who="S0144">was there?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0024">when we had all that rain <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0144">yeah but he's got a hose leading from the runoff as well</u>
<u n="76" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0144">so that's why it's got</u>
<u n="78" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah what the runoff off the shed? Yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0144">I suppose if he keeps burning stuff in it it's gonna create a seal isn't it?</u>
<u n="80" who="S0024" trans="overlap">but it you've got to think <pause dur="short"/> oh I don't know <pause dur="short"/> is that why he's doing it?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0144" trans="overlap">that's the idea <pause dur="short"/> that's that's why he's burning it I think <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="82" who="S0024">but what about that part of it?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0144">well I don't know <pause dur="short"/> well I think he's going to move onto that bit he said</u>
<u n="84" who="S0024">oh <pause dur="short"/> I didn't know that's what why we always had our bonfires here <pause dur="short"/> because we used to have our bonfires there</u>
<u n="85" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it makes sense though doesn't it?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I just thought it was a nice place because it it was all indented in the thing</u>
<u n="87" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well <pause dur="short"/> that as well</u>
<u n="88" who="S0024">I don't know</u>

<u n="93" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0024">for it</u>
<u n="95" who="S0024">so I dug the <trunc>out</trunc> the outline and I said I wanted it like this with a little bridge going across there <pause dur="short"/> that was my my <trunc>dre</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> I had to draw a <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> you know what mum and dad are like <pause dur="short"/> I had to draw up plans and everything <pause dur="short"/> this is what I'm going to do</u>
<u n="96" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="97" who="S0024">here this is what it's going to look like <pause dur="short"/> I did all of that <pause dur="short"/> then I  then I  dug all the way around the outside of this <pause dur="short"/> this is the shape <pause dur="short"/> and then dad brought the digger in</u>
<u n="98" who="S0144">mm mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0024">and we found the end of the hose pipe right there <pause dur="short"/> it was perfect that we could just just get cos erm yeah the runoff from the shed the hosepipe is actually underground and it comes all the way up to here</u>
<u n="100" who="S0144">the hose is underground?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0024">yeah cos we used to have the goat sheds there until they all burnt down</u>
<u n="102" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0024">they all burnt down so we had water</u>
<u n="104" who="S0144" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="105" who="S0024">from I think it was from the <trunc>dai</trunc></u>

<u n="108" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0024">and so there was a a hose pipe underground there and we dug the pond just in the right place and we found the end of the hose pipe <pause dur="short"/> it was really lucky</u>
<u n="110" who="S0144" trans="overlap">ah <pause dur="short"/> that is lucky</u>
<u n="111" who="S0024">and it was like this is fate <pause dur="short"/> this is what  this is what  the <trunc>po</trunc> where the pond should be <pause dur="short"/> but alas it doesn't want to be <pause dur="short"/> but anyway yeah and then and then we brought in the digger to dig out the rest but I'd dug <pause dur="short"/> it  took me  took me months every weekend <pause dur="short"/> and I was only like fourteen or something</u>
<u n="112" who="S0144" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
