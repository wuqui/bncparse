<u n="1" who="S0421">so <pause dur="short"/> electric cars don't have petrol so you just <pause dur="short"/> plug them in?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="3" who="S0421">do you have to pay for the use of that <vocal desc="cough"/> <trunc>plug</trunc></u>
<u n="4" who="S0423" trans="overlap">eh?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0421">do you have to pay for the use of that plugging in?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0423">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I've never really <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>loo</trunc>looked at them <pause dur="short"/> I think there's some in there's one in the erm <pause dur="short"/> in Ikea in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="7" who="S0421">really?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0423" trans="overlap">car park yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0421">that's weird</u>
<u n="10" who="S0423">I wonder how long they take</u>
<u n="11" who="S0421">I know yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>have no idea</unclear></u>
<u n="13" who="S0421">like charging your phone or something <pause dur="short"/> I know that must be such a pain if you've got an electric car like how many places are there to <pause dur="short"/> charge them up?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0423">well the thing is if you have an electric car <pause dur="short"/> you you really have to plan for your journeys don't you <unclear>really</unclear>?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh do they not last that long?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0423">no they're not really <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>I</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> they don't have a wide radius so they're probably more suited if you're just going to use your car for round <pause dur="short"/> the city you know if you're going to have to do much</u>
<u n="17" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0423">motorway travelling <pause dur="short"/> you need to know there's somewhere to charge it up and whether it's practical to do it if you're travelling any distance <pause dur="short"/> cos the charge will only last so long and so many miles I don't know it's a hundred miles or something</u>
<u n="19" who="S0421">ah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0423">which'd probably be quite difficult doing a <pause dur="short"/> journey like this I suppose <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> that's why hybrid cars are more popular aren't they it's kind of a mixture of</u>
<u n="21" who="S0421">mm</u>
<u n="22" who="S0423">different fuels you could use <pause dur="short"/> well I don't know what <pause dur="short"/> how they work really but <pause dur="long"/> I'm guessing it's petrol and electric a hybrid is it? you can kinda switch from one to the other so it gives you that bit more of a range but you're using fuel less <pause dur="short"/> petrol less <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="23" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah it must be</u>
<u n="24" who="S0423">it's four o'clock</u>
<u n="25" who="S0421">I know</u>
<u n="26" who="S0423">probably about half way there I think <pause dur="short"/> I wanna try and get there before seven if <pause dur="short"/> not we'll have to call them</u>
<u n="27" who="S0421"><unclear>great</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> why?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0423">it says it on the website ring us if you're arriving <pause dur="short"/> says check in at four o'clock</u>
<u n="29" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="30" who="S0423">subject to delays if you're <pause dur="short"/> gonna be later than seven <pause dur="short"/> I think they need a car to make sure there's somebody there for the</u>
<u n="31" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0423">to give you the key <pause dur="short"/> and if you arrive after eleven at night then <pause dur="short"/> it says <pause dur="short"/> I don't think there'll be anyone there to accept you</u>
<u n="33" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="34" who="S0423">and they may give out your room to someone else</u>
<u n="35" who="S0421">huh</u>
<u n="36" who="S0423"><unclear>can't though</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> seems a bit odd so you can <pause dur="short"/> if you pay for it for four days</u>
<u n="37" who="S0421" trans="overlap">I know</u>
<u n="38" who="S0423">how could they give it out to anyone else?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0421">like would they just give it to someone for <trunc>th</trunc> a night or?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0423">I think it's unlikely you'd think they'd ring you first or <pause dur="short"/> if we were gonna be that late we'd ring them wouldn't we?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0423">let's hope <pause dur="short"/> traffic's not too bad cos it <pause dur="short"/> considering the traffic we've been in it's not too bad</u>
<u n="43" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0423">and we've stopped having a break so <pause dur="short"/> if we don't have much traffic we might be okay <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="45" who="S0421">they had sun cream two for eight pounds or something in Asda</u>
<u n="46" who="S0423">really I'm <trunc>s</trunc> that's where I got mine in Asda</u>
<u n="47" who="S0421">did you?</u>

<u n="55" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0423">I got Nivea <pause dur="short"/> I bought a kids' one</u>
<u n="57" who="S0421">oh why?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0423">cos it was cheap <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0423">it was on offer it was half price</u>
<u n="61" who="S0421" trans="overlap">that's like factor fifty or something isn't it?</u>
<u n="62" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's alright I'm not coming out with a suntan</u>
<u n="63" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I suppose though yeah</u>
<u n="64" who="S0423">it should've been ten pound got it for five so I thought well</u>
<u n="65" who="S0421">oh that's alright</u>
<u n="66" who="S0423">why would I pay more? for <pause dur="short"/> a different <unclear>one where it's the <trunc>s</trunc>same kinda thing like</unclear></u>
<u n="67" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah and it's less as well <pause dur="short"/> it'll be a <pause dur="short"/> lower UV</u>
<u n="68" who="S0423">yeah I think this one had <trunc>th</trunc>they had stars on that's why I went for this this has got like four stars <pause dur="short"/> the others had three</u>
<u n="69" who="S0421">oh</u>
<u n="70" who="S0423">so I thought right I'm going for the <unclear>highest now</unclear> <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> I don't know why I'm getting all conscientious about sun cream I never used to wear it</u>
<u n="71" who="S0421" trans="overlap">it's not the coloured one is it?</u>
<u n="72" who="S0423">what's coloured?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0421">cos you can get kids' coloured fifty so it's like for water and it's like green on your skin</u>
<u n="74" who="S0423"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear>it</unclear> didn't say that <unclear>I hope</unclear></u>
<u n="75" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="76" who="S0423">otherwise I'll be walking round with a green face</u>
<u n="77" who="S0421"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah it makes you like a pale green</u>
<u n="78" who="S0423">why do they do that? just cos kids like it?</u>

<u n="80" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>a higher</unclear> protection?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0421">I think it also shows you if it's still on <pause dur="short"/> if you're going to walk</u>
<u n="82" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah cos you see <pause dur="short"/> some of these Australians they put all these coloured ones on their nose or something don't they?</u>
<u n="83" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0423">and on their lips they have like a coloured thing</u>

<u n="86" who="S0423" trans="overlap">ah <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="87" who="S0421">and I think it's either <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>it's like for</unclear> water so it either doesn't wash off as easily</u>
<u n="88" who="S0423">or it shows you when it's wearing off?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0421">yeah or it show <trunc>w</trunc> like you know for kids <unclear>they're</unclear> like <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>when do I</unclear> top it up</u>
<u n="90" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think they're really <pause dur="short"/> like <pause dur="short"/> a bit obsessed in <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0421">Australia</u>
<u n="92" who="S0423">in Australia <unclear>about it it might be the same when when</unclear></u>
<u n="93" who="S0421" trans="overlap">quite rightly so though</u>
<u n="94" who="S0423">well yeah I can understand why you know cos there's so much sun <pause dur="short"/> but I think me mam <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>w</trunc> when she went over <pause dur="short"/> she was outside in it <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>outsi</trunc>outside in like midday <pause dur="short"/> in</u>

<u n="99" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know well it is a bit <pause dur="short"/> like even in erm <pause dur="short"/> like sometimes when grandma and granddad said <trunc>n</trunc> on <trunc>th</trunc>the radio and stuff they'll say they'll advise you not to go out at midday</u>
<u n="100" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well then I mean it's forty degrees up there it's ridiculous isn't it?</u>

<u n="129" who="S0421">I know but you know like face and arms? it's just it's a pain to like rub it all in and then <pause dur="short"/> you feel a bit sticky and</u>
<u n="130" who="S0423">yeah I if you know you're gonna be out all day it's probably a good idea isn't it you even if it's overcast and</u>
<u n="131" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="132" who="S0423">erm <pause dur="short"/> but most people <pause dur="short"/> generally <pause dur="short"/> unless you're going off for a day trip or you're you're you know you don't work outdoors then you tend not to need <pause dur="short"/> a great deal outdoors do you? <pause dur="long"/> I mean I don't think you have to worry too much in the winter</u>

<u n="143" who="S0421">no yeah there's a few foods that you can get it from <pause dur="short"/> I did look it up <pause dur="long"/> because some people are allergic to sunlight</u>
<u n="144" who="S0423">that's a quite rare thing though isn't it?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0421">yeah but <pause dur="short"/> they have to get their vitamin D from somewhere</u>

<u n="451" who="S0421">yeah they'd just be hidden wouldn't they in the?</u>
<u n="452" who="S0423">cos they're saying deer <pause dur="short"/> they want something to <pause dur="short"/> control the population of deer</u>

<u n="454" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>control them like a pest</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> yeah well I guess we have loads of those places where it is but they said <unclear>it's cos really</unclear> they're <pause dur="short"/> they're destroying the forest you know cos they eat bark and trees and</u>
<u n="455" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="456" who="S0423"><unclear>what maybe</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> the trees die when they eat them</u>
<u n="457" who="S0421">oh I like deers <pause dur="short"/> ah</u>
<u n="458" who="S0423">and occasionally they they have to do a cull <pause dur="short"/> they just go out and shoot them</u>
<u n="459" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="460" who="S0423">so they're saying well let's have a natural <pause dur="short"/> predator a lynx <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>it's good they</unclear> hunt the deer and <pause dur="short"/> they used to be the predator but</u>
<u n="461" who="S0421">yeah</u>

<u n="465" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="466" who="S0423">why can't you just grow them?</u>
<u n="467" who="S0421">well yeah we could but it would take years</u>

<u n="469" who="S0421">erm <pause dur="short"/> we don't want them here as well <pause dur="short"/> at our other house</u>
<u n="470" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>oh right</unclear></u>
<u n="471" who="S0421">and er some of them it would say like deer proof and I was like I wish I had deers coming into my garden like the <pause dur="short"/> I need a deer proof fence to keep them out <pause dur="short"/> who has deers that invade in their garden?</u>
<u n="472" who="S0423"><unclear>some people must</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> if you have a nice garden and deers come in and trample it all</u>
<u n="473" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="474" who="S0423"><unclear>people</unclear> wouldn't be happy would they? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="475" who="S0421">I don't think erm <pause dur="short"/> the lynx would really attack people would it?</u>
<u n="476" who="S0423">no they wouldn't they'd be too scared of us</u>
<u n="477" who="S0421" trans="overlap">cos like the wolves would wouldn't they?</u>
<u n="478" who="S0423">you know they say wolves don't <pause dur="short"/> but it's only in wolves if you're <pause dur="short"/> doing something that like threatened them</u>
<u n="479" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="480" who="S0423"><unclear>er</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> you know <unclear>do like</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> in their territory and you're <pause dur="short"/> they feel under threat but otherwise they'd they'd probably not <pause dur="short"/> they wouldn't attack us for food <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>I guess yes</unclear> if they're starving <pause dur="short"/> then <pause dur="short"/> well they say wolves never really attacked <pause dur="short"/> humans much</u>
<u n="481" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="482" who="S0423">but I think why <pause dur="short"/> they were killed out and stuff is cos they would've <unclear>been</unclear> attacking the livestock like sheep and cattle</u>
<u n="483" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="484" who="S0423">but humans I think they try to steer clear of</u>
<u n="485" who="S0421">oh we still have foxes don't we yeah?</u>
<u n="486" who="S0423">yeah <unclear>but they're not</unclear></u>
<u n="487" who="S0421" trans="overlap">but they eat take livestock but I suppose they're not as like big as wolves are they?</u>
<u n="488" who="S0423">no <unclear>might do</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> I guess they could get <pause dur="short"/> lambs and chickens they <trunc>d</trunc></u>
<u n="489" who="S0421" trans="overlap">chickens</u>
<u n="490" who="S0423">probably wouldn't get a <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't imagine they'd get well they might get a sheep I don't know <pause dur="short"/> but the sheep would be a bit big for them <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>left them and the cattle</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> I guess foxes population will increase <pause dur="short"/> now they've stopped fox hunting</u>
<u n="491" who="S0421">yeah <pause dur="short"/> haven't they <trunc>sto</trunc> oh they have stopped it haven't they?</u>
<u n="492" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="493" who="S0421">they wanted to bring it back in though didn't they?</u>
<u n="494" who="S0423">who did?</u>
<u n="495" who="S0421">Conservatives</u>
<u n="496" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>don't know</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> well the Conservatives were against it</u>

<u n="498" who="S0423"><unclear>when they were bringing <pause dur="short"/> rules for it</unclear></u>
<u n="499" who="S0421" trans="overlap">so they wanted to bring it in then?</u>
<u n="500" who="S0423">well I don't know whether they were thinking about it you know when they were <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>y</trunc> they got back in government but they must've thought it's gonna be a bit of a controversial issue</u>
<u n="501" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="502" who="S0423">a lot of people are against it <pause dur="short"/> a lot of Conservatives <unclear>their voters</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> their they the people who like fox hunting <pause dur="short"/> will be Conservatives</u>
<u n="503" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="504" who="S0423">so I guess they weighed up should we do it because the people who want it are our voters <pause dur="short"/> but they probably realised the amount of people who were against it</u>
<u n="505" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="506" who="S0423">probably <pause dur="short"/> would <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <unclear>wouldn't be a <trunc>go</trunc></unclear> good thing for the election really</u>
<u n="507" who="S0421">didn't we use to have moose here?</u>
<u n="508" who="S0423">no</u>
<u n="509" who="S0421">no? are they in like cold places?</u>
<u n="510" who="S0423"><unclear>probably</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> well like the only area I know about them really is like in <pause dur="short"/> canada</u>
<u n="511" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="512" who="S0423"><unclear>if</unclear> they exist anywhere else I don't know <pause dur="short"/> cos in Scandinavia is it elk?</u>
<u n="513" who="S0421">oh</u>
<u n="514" who="S0423">rather than moose isn't it?</u>
<u n="515" who="S0421">although those people on that programme were eating moose</u>
<u n="516" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>that's what I would think</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> what programme?</u>
<u n="517" who="S0421">that one where they were living in the Arctic Circle</u>
<u n="518" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh was that moose <unclear>there</unclear>?</u>
<u n="519" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah that was moose</u>
<u n="520" who="S0423">oh right so that would be it must be in the north where they inhabit</u>
<u n="521" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="522" who="S0423">it was like <pause dur="short"/> scandinavia wasn't it yeah?</u>
<u n="523" who="S0421" trans="overlap">with the reindeer</u>
<u n="524" who="S0423">I was thinking it <pause dur="short"/> was a different animal <pause dur="short"/> elk or</u>
<u n="525" who="S0421">there are elks <pause dur="short"/> are they in Canada maybe?</u>
<u n="526" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="long"/> although if you go far back enough er <pause dur="short"/> there was all kinds of wild animals here if you go back before the Ice Age I guess it used to be like a tropical area here didn't it?</u>
<u n="527" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="528" who="S0423">so there was tigers and that kind of thing</u>
<u n="529" who="S0421">oh</u>
<u n="530" who="S0423">lions <unclear>we had lions</unclear></u>

<u n="534" who="S0423">you get people being eaten by tigers in India still</u>
<u n="535" who="S0421">yeah but <pause dur="short"/> they would they like actively <trunc>sear</trunc> seek you out or? is it just if you get in their path?</u>
<u n="536" who="S0423">well I guess generally maybe sometimes if <unclear>people are crossing</unclear> but there are <pause dur="short"/> where they tend to go hunting for a tiger and killing it is if they've killed <unclear>a human once</unclear> you know? obviously if they <unclear>once they've</unclear></u>
<u n="537" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="538" who="S0423">killed a human then they might see it as prey then in the future and start <pause dur="short"/> actively seeking it out <unclear>but for them</unclear> no I don't think they do <pause dur="short"/> they probably try <pause dur="short"/> really try hard to avoid humans tigers don't they?</u>
<u n="539" who="S0421">yeah <pause dur="long"/> cos they're mainly in like the the jungle aren't they?</u>
<u n="540" who="S0423">yeah I would imagine yeah</u>
<u n="541" who="S0421" trans="overlap"><unclear>quite</unclear> hidden</u>
<u n="542" who="S0423">and they're <pause dur="short"/> they're probably quite a rare thing though aren't they?</u>

<u n="545" who="S0421">they're yeah and they're like quite solitary like you know they don't live in a thing like <trunc>ti</trunc> like lions so <trunc>y</trunc> tigers they just like hunt on their own and stuff don't they?</u>
<u n="546" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="547" who="S0421">I think <unclear>aren't</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> although you know like cos cats like the the cat kind of animals <pause dur="short"/> they do tend to kind of like not live in a a group but I think they do live in a group sometimes but they like kind of go off on their own</u>
<u n="548" who="S0423">yeah they're much more independent minded</u>
<u n="549" who="S0421">cos I know that cats have erm <pause dur="short"/> cos I was quite interested they have like erm a <trunc>ma</trunc> they they live in a matriarchal society so it's the female ones that are like <pause dur="short"/> in charge rather than the male ones</u>
<u n="550" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="551" who="S0421">so <pause dur="short"/> they must have like some form of <pause dur="short"/>  like society thing going on <pause dur="short"/> but I don't think they kind of interact</u>
<u n="552" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>there must be</unclear> some hierarchy probably not quite <pause dur="short"/> like a dog <pause dur="short"/> cos it's very specific about packs isn't it?</u>
<u n="553" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah cos they all live in a pack</u>
<u n="554" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="555" who="S0421">but lions all live in like a <pause dur="short"/> a what's it called a pride?</u>
<u n="556" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0421">they all like <trunc>w</trunc> live together don't they? but I think</u>
<u n="558" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="559" who="S0421">maybe with with other cats it's like a kind of general territory <pause dur="short"/> and they might come across each other but not like <pause dur="short"/> and they're kind of like <trunc>o</trunc>kay they're with me <pause dur="short"/> they're not an intruder</u>
<u n="560" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well like the male <pause dur="short"/> I guess they just don't <pause dur="short"/> they're not that bothered are they? they just don't think much of anything</u>
<u n="561" who="S0421">yeah</u>

<u n="704" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think they're more interested in conserving energy cos they go around eating all day don't they?</u>
<u n="705" who="S0421">yeah because they've got to each so much of the bamboo <pause dur="short"/> cos it's got like no nutrients in it like hardly any so they've got to eat all day to actually get something from it</u>
<u n="706" who="S0423">makes you wonder how they get so big though <pause dur="short"/> cos they're only small when they babies aren't they?</u>

<u n="711" who="S0421" trans="overlap">I know I think it's it's just how they've evolved <pause dur="short"/> because I think that's what all there was for them to eat <pause dur="short"/> and now that's what they eat and then like people cutting down the forest and they can't eat anything else</u>
<u n="712" who="S0423">can't they say here have a <pause dur="short"/> peace of <unclear>mango</unclear> or?</u>
<u n="713" who="S0421" trans="overlap">probably wouldn't eat it <pause dur="long"/> they'd probably eat too much of it then cos they'd think they have to eat it all the time <pause dur="short"/> they'd probably be obese</u>

<u n="722" who="S0423"><unclear>why do the keepers cuddle them or?</unclear></u>
<u n="723" who="S0421">I don't know I would if I was a keeper well they go in with them like it's fine to go in with them and <pause dur="short"/> they like pick up the little ones and stuff</u>
<u n="724" who="S0423">yeah</u>

<u n="726" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="727" who="S0421">and they're so cute and they were like climbing on the erm <pause dur="short"/> on the keeper like cos they feed them like apples and things <pause dur="short"/> and they like try and make it difficult for them to get and they like do puzzles and things <pause dur="short"/> but they all they all like they see the keeper come in and then they like run <pause dur="short"/> and they're all like latching onto the keeper and they look they are they look so nice <pause dur="short"/> and like soft they're really cute</u>
<u n="728" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="long"/> are they endangered as well the red panda? I think they are</u>

<u n="730" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="731" who="S0421">but the local people at the erm <pause dur="short"/> where there's like pandas <pause dur="short"/> there was like all this there was like a storm I think or something <pause dur="short"/> and it blocked off like the pandas' route in the forest and all the local people went with some <pause dur="short"/> er wildlife volunteers to help <pause dur="short"/> and like move away this like blockage and like help the pandas and everything</u>
<u n="732" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="733" who="S0421">it's nice <unclear>listen</unclear> <pause dur="long"/> and like people keep building like roads as well in the middle of like their <pause dur="short"/> areas <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>that</unclear></u>

<u n="740" who="S0423"><unclear>don't know</unclear> maybe</u>
<u n="741" who="S0421">I don't know</u>
<u n="742" who="S0423">I think the problem is it is a dwindling <pause dur="short"/> food source the panda in the forest are</u>
<u n="743" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="744" who="S0423">I mean some of that has been because of humans as well so</u>
<u n="745" who="S0421">yeah</u>

<u n="768" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> whereas we <pause dur="short"/> we don't really have the teeth</u>
<u n="769" who="S0421">we don't have anything</u>
<u n="770" who="S0423"><unclear/></u>
<u n="771" who="S0421" trans="overlap">and our skin</u>
<u n="772" who="S0423"><unclear/></u>
<u n="773" who="S0421" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it'd cut right through it</u>
<u n="774" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's funny it well the only thing we have is a brain isn't it?</u>
<u n="775" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="776" who="S0423"><unclear>that</unclear> kind of <pause dur="short"/> makes us stand out <unclear/> <unclear>naturally</unclear> <unclear/></u>
<u n="777" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah if if we didn't like if we couldn't make tools or anything we'd literally be <pause dur="short"/> so susceptible to anything like getting us</u>
<u n="778" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="779" who="S0421">like we don't have claws we don't have teeth</u>
<u n="780" who="S0423">well</u>
<u n="781" who="S0421">we probably can't run that fast <vocal desc="laugh"/> really</u>
<u n="782" who="S0423">maybe originally we were furry weren't we?</u>
<u n="783" who="S0421">erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="784" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well we had a lot more hair didn't we?</u>
<u n="785" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="786" who="S0423">probably not that much to kind of keep <unclear>you</unclear> warm I don't know</u>
<u n="787" who="S0421">maybe kind of like monkeys <pause dur="short"/> I dunno</u>
<u n="788" who="S0423">yeah but why would you start losing that fur?</u>
<u n="789" who="S0421">er it might've just been a <pause dur="short"/> random like <pause dur="short"/> you know like? some <trunc>somethi</trunc> cos like what I was saying is like how strange is it that we still keep the hair on our head</u>
<u n="790" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="791" who="S0421">and it's like <pause dur="short"/> it cos it maybe it was people with the genes like certain genes and like it could've been <pause dur="short"/> even more beneficial at one point <pause dur="short"/> like wherever people lived <pause dur="short"/> for them <pause dur="short"/> you know to survive without all this fur or <pause dur="short"/> it could've been random like all the people with fur might've died out cos of the famine or something</u>
<u n="792" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="793" who="S0421">you know like a random thing?</u>
<u n="794" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="795" who="S0421">cos that does happen sometimes so like the people with those genes died out and then <pause dur="short"/> the the people who didn't have fur just lived on cos they lived in a different area or something</u>
<u n="796" who="S0423">where are these people with fur why did they develop?</u>
<u n="797" who="S0421">I don't know how we were <trunc>orig</trunc>originally <pause dur="short"/> maybe we did originally have fur and then it's like a mutation <pause dur="short"/> that someone didn't have fur <pause dur="short"/> and then these people survived cos the fur people died in a famine I don't know</u>
<u n="798" who="S0423">they could be cross breeding as well with other</u>
<u n="799" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="800" who="S0423">human type species couldn't they?</u>
<u n="801" who="S0421">yeah they do you know they might've been <pause dur="short"/> different <trunc>s</trunc> like <pause dur="short"/> versions of people <pause dur="short"/> you know because like you get different cats?</u>
<u n="802" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="803" who="S0421">do you think there was ever like different people like that?</u>
<u n="804" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well they know there were there was erm <pause dur="short"/> there's a there's one example what what's the erm? cos we're homo sapiens there's another type</u>
<u n="805" who="S0421">oh is there?</u>
<u n="806" who="S0423">I'm sure there is I don't know the name <pause dur="short"/> and they think we we all he's er he's got a smaller brain <pause dur="short"/> erm I think they might be more <pause dur="short"/> physically</u>
<u n="807" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="808" who="S0423">stronger than us but <pause dur="short"/> er and they say they they must've been interbreeding I think everybody has <pause dur="short"/> er <unclear>part of erm</unclear></u>
<u n="809" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="810" who="S0423">a a small percent <pause dur="short"/> one of these this kind of species in them</u>
<u n="811" who="S0421">oh</u>
<u n="812" who="S0423">their DNA</u>
<u n="813" who="S0421">see there might've been more though we don't know about</u>
<u n="814" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well there might be yeah just cos they've</u>
<u n="815" who="S0421" trans="overlap">they might've <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="816" who="S0423">cos they've got <pause dur="short"/> evidence of this</u>
<u n="817" who="S0421">yeah because I've always <trunc>fou</trunc>found that funny that like it's just like humans <pause dur="short"/> and then like in other animals it's like oh this is the big cat family oh this is like the canine family like <pause dur="short"/> and then it's like humans <pause dur="short"/> it's like everyone's human like one human</u>
<u n="818" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="819" who="S0421">there's not not like <pause dur="short"/> human <trunc>r</trunc> blah blah blah and like other human blah blah blah</u>
<u n="820" who="S0423">well I guess <pause dur="short"/> at some point there's variations in <unclear>it's DNA</unclear> kind of thing <unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="821" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah I mean there's that race but</u>
<u n="822" who="S0423">but I don't</u>
<u n="823" who="S0421" trans="overlap">it's not like you wouldn't you wouldn't really call it like <pause dur="short"/> a different species would you?</u>
<u n="824" who="S0423">well no <unclear>I don't think</unclear></u>
<u n="825" who="S0421" trans="overlap">you wouldn't be like oh there's other humans like oh what are they? they're like <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>how would they?</unclear></u>
<u n="826" who="S0423" trans="overlap">would you class er <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> the different kind of cat a lion and tiger they're classed as different species aren't they?</u>
<u n="827" who="S0421" trans="overlap">I don't know are they like variations or something?</u>
<u n="828" who="S0423" trans="overlap">the species is kind of the cat family isn't there?</u>
<u n="829" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="830" who="S0423">but then again it they with the human thing they'd be part of humanoids wouldn't they?</u>
<u n="831" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="832" who="S0423">would they be variations on it like cats I suppose or?</u>
<u n="833" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="834" who="S0423">they'd have different characteristics erm</u>
<u n="835" who="S0421">cos there's so many different types of cats like <pause dur="short"/> and dogs and <pause dur="short"/> and like within</u>
<u n="836" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well dogs is they all come from a wolf don't they?</u>
<u n="837" who="S0421">yeah but like within like <pause dur="short"/> even like</u>
<u n="838" who="S0423" trans="overlap">well that's through breeding human interference that</u>
<u n="839" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="840" who="S0423">cos you said <trunc>o</trunc>riginally</u>
<u n="841" who="S0421">no but aren't like foxes are they like? part of the</u>
<u n="842" who="S0423">oh I don't know</u>
<u n="843" who="S0421">or maybe they're not</u>
<u n="844" who="S0423">I don't know if they're classed as the same kind of family are they?</u>
<u n="845" who="S0421">maybe there was something else <pause dur="short"/> but <unclear>it is and</unclear> you kind of think about their like <pause dur="short"/> they way they're</u>
<u n="846" who="S0423" trans="overlap">no you never see them being mentioned do you you know when like you mentioned canines?</u>
<u n="847" who="S0421">yeah maybe they're not</u>
<u n="848" who="S0423"><unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> but they are they look like em <unclear>as well don't they?</unclear></u>
<u n="849" who="S0421" trans="overlap">they will yeah and they kind of have a bit of a bark don't they well not a bark but <pause dur="short"/> the kind of noise they make</u>
<u n="850" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="851" who="S0421">cos <unclear>they are</unclear> I think they're they're more of a dog than a cat</u>
<u n="852" who="S0423">well they're not a cat you know it's it's</u>
<u n="853" who="S0421" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="854" who="S0423">very similar characteristics to a dog isn't it the snout?</u>
<u n="855" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="856" who="S0423">the claws</u>
<u n="857" who="S0421">I mean <pause dur="short"/> cats have <trunc>paw</trunc> oh I really like cats paws they're like really soft <pause dur="short"/> I always like to grab my cat's feet but they don't like it so they pull them away <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="858" who="S0423">no they're different a dog's are quite rough aren't they?</u>
<u n="859" who="S0421">yeah <pause dur="long"/> and didn't we use to have tails possibly?</u>
<u n="860" who="S0423">yeah they say we did</u>
<u n="861" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="862" who="S0423" trans="overlap">cos there's there's the <pause dur="short"/> er <unclear>you know at the back</unclear> of your the end of your spine the coccyx bone or something or</u>
<u n="863" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="864" who="S0423"><unclear>said it'd been</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> so yeah I suppose if you go back far enough then</u>
<u n="865" who="S0421">I think tails would be quite useful</u>
<u n="866" who="S0423">well <pause dur="short"/> yeah they <unclear>didn't like</unclear> I don't know I guess <pause dur="short"/> I again why would? how come they've? we've adapted to <unclear>not having them</unclear>?</u>
<u n="867" who="S0421" trans="overlap">cos you think they'd they'd be useful wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="868" who="S0423">they would yeah they'd be useful for getting rid of insects</u>
<u n="869" who="S0421">but like balance</u>
<u n="870" who="S0423">well when you're up in the trees yeah <pause dur="short"/> but at some point I think maybe we were up the trees and we came down and</u>
<u n="871" who="S0421" trans="overlap">must've never needed them any more yeah</u>
<u n="872" who="S0423">maybe they got in the way of</u>
<u n="873" who="S0421">yeah maybe predators like grabbed them or something</u>
<u n="874" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="875" who="S0421">who knows? <pause dur="long"/> because there was like <pause dur="short"/> you know like when they had like <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> like freak shows for like people with like <pause dur="short"/> extra limbs and things?</u>
<u n="876" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="877" who="S0421">I think there was someone in there once with like a tail</u>
<u n="878" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="879" who="S0421">so <pause dur="short"/> it's still possible <pause dur="short"/> to be born with a tail</u>
<u n="880" who="S0423">no wasn't it something else though and it looked like a tail?</u>
<u n="881" who="S0421" trans="overlap">maybe <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="882" who="S0423">kind of like a bone er?</u>
<u n="883" who="S0421">yeah but that's what a tail would be</u>
<u n="884" who="S0423">well part of it would be and <unclear>maybe not the</unclear> rest of it</u>
<u n="885" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="886" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>broken off from it</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>some of his bones are soft</unclear></u>
<u n="887" who="S0421">well there's like been people born with extra legs and things</u>
<u n="888" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="long"/> maybe that's like you were saying that's where variations come in evolution where</u>
<u n="889" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="890" who="S0423">you get separate <unclear>people who are</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> slightly different and then <pause dur="short"/> you know if that gene gets passed on and</u>
<u n="891" who="S0421">cos that's what we learnt in GCSE biology but there must be a lot more to it but that's what they teach us basically at GCSE biology</u>
<u n="892" who="S0423">yes <pause dur="short"/> probably quite a complicated subject isn't it? a good sunset</u>
<u n="893" who="S0421">oh <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="894" who="S0423"><vocal desc="yawn"/> <pause dur="long"/> it's not as picturesque as the drive to <anon type="place"/> was it? well when we were in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="895" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="896" who="S0423" trans="overlap">it's a lot <pause dur="short"/> well flatter <unclear>I like a really mountainous area so</unclear></u>
<u n="897" who="S0421">yeah I like mountains <pause dur="short"/> not climbing them I like the way they look</u>
<u n="898" who="S0423"><unclear>remember seeing</unclear> an amazing site when you went up <anon type="place"/> last year wasn't it going up to the <pause dur="short"/> <unclear><anon type="place"/></unclear></u>
<u n="899" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="900" who="S0423">just shows you how massive a mountain range they are</u>
<u n="901" who="S0421">I think it'd be nice to live in the mountains</u>
<u n="902" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="903" who="S0421">although where would you get your food from?</u>
<u n="904" who="S0423">shop <pause dur="short"/> they have shops there <unclear>as well</unclear></u>
<u n="905" who="S0421">yeah I know but you they <trunc>wo</trunc> it <trunc>wo</trunc> wouldn't it be expensive cos it'd have to be like imported wouldn't it? from other areas cos you wouldn't really grow anything on the mountains</u>
<u n="906" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>mountains</unclear> <unclear/> you get some <unclear>of them</unclear> <unclear>on the hills don't you?</unclear></u>
<u n="907" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="908" who="S0423">but any rural areas a bit dearer isn't it?</u>
<u n="909" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="910" who="S0423">cos everything has to come in by road <pause dur="short"/> whereas if you're in cities</u>
<u n="911" who="S0421">no but if you were like in the countryside all the produce would be grown there <pause dur="short"/> although I suppose it's still expensive cos it'd be like local farmers wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="912" who="S0423">yeah and <pause dur="short"/> if you don't have the local farm then it's <pause dur="short"/> it goes out of the country to be processed <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>then when it's processed you can collect isn't it</unclear>?</u>
<u n="913" who="S0421">why do they send it out of the country?</u>
<u n="914" who="S0423">cos <unclear>gotta go out the countryside to er <trunc>lo</trunc></unclear></u>
<u n="915" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> oh I thought you</u>
<u n="916" who="S0423">yeah</u>
<u n="917" who="S0421">meant like <pause dur="short"/> france or something</u>
<u n="918" who="S0423">no</u>
<u n="919" who="S0421">I was like why's it going?</u>
<u n="920" who="S0423">but you know even if you're getting carrots and things from Tesco</u>
<u n="921" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="922" who="S0423"><unclear>whatever distance they harvest stuff</unclear> they put em in a big truck and then they bring it to a central warehouse</u>
<u n="923" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="924" who="S0423">do whatever they want in the <unclear>factory so</unclear> <pause dur="long"/> <unclear>fuel is here</unclear> <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="925" who="S0421"><unclear>and</unclear> like the people who like live really far up on the mountains <pause dur="short"/> have different lungs</u>
<u n="926" who="S0423">oh when you live in <pause dur="short"/> great altitude?</u>
<u n="927" who="S0421">yeah so they can breathe the air</u>
<u n="928" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah you're adapted yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos if you're if you're going to stay you're going up climbing up in the hills yeah</u>
<u n="929" who="S0421" trans="overlap"><unclear>have</unclear> to do it gradually</u>
<u n="930" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos you can get altitude sickness it's very dangerous</u>
<u n="931" who="S0421">is that like similar to what divers get when they come up too fast</u>
<u n="932" who="S0423">no I think it's probably different symptoms like they've got</u>
<u n="933" who="S0421" trans="overlap">or is that something <trunc>el</trunc>? <trunc>i</trunc>?</u>
<u n="934" who="S0423">they've got like the bends <unclear>and everything</unclear></u>
<u n="935" who="S0421" trans="overlap">is that oh isn't that when you get like?</u>
<u n="936" who="S0423">it does something to your blood</u>
<u n="937" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oxygen <trunc>bloo</trunc> or like bubbles in your blood or something?</u>
<u n="938" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah yeah it's a different thing so I'm not quite sure <pause dur="short"/> not sure <unclear>if too</unclear> I don't know too much about it really but <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>it is very very</unclear></u>
<u n="939" who="S0421" trans="overlap">cos you always see on the films like people swimming up from the depths like <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> pursued by a shark like quick <pause dur="short"/> quick but if they did that really</u>
<u n="940" who="S0423">yeah well you have to be really deep though I think to get it</u>
<u n="941" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="942" who="S0423">to have that as a consideration</u>
<u n="943" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh like when the pressure like you but you can hardly really feel it when you go down there can't you?</u>
<u n="944" who="S0423" trans="overlap">yeah cos <unclear>it's gotta be like very deep</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean you are you have gotta be far down in the sea for that it's like proper deep sea divers <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> they have to go into a decompression thing in the bottom of the ship and they have</u>
<u n="945" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="946" who="S0423">like a bell or something that that the <pause dur="short"/> the air is</u>
<u n="947" who="S0421">but the the people who</u>
<u n="948" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>condensed</unclear> it's under pressure</u>
<u n="949" who="S0421" trans="overlap">the people who dive for pearls they go down quite far</u>
<u n="950" who="S0423">I think it's cos they're not down there for long</u>
<u n="951" who="S0421" trans="overlap">and they <pause dur="short"/> oh cos they don't even take a tank yeah</u>
<u n="952" who="S0423" trans="overlap">cos they're holding their breath <pause dur="short"/> well they're <unclear>only</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> they can probably hold their breath like four five minutes</u>
<u n="953" who="S0421" trans="overlap"><trunc>s</trunc>seven minutes</u>
<u n="954" who="S0423">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm I think if you're up and if you're down and up so quick <pause dur="short"/> I mean divers the deep sea divers they're down there for <pause dur="short"/> you know could be for a long time so that's <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="955" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh right yeah <pause dur="short"/> with the tanks</u>
<u n="956" who="S0423">cos <pause dur="short"/> so then it's affecting your</u>
<u n="957" who="S0421">oh so when you go in a submarine?</u>
<u n="958" who="S0423" trans="overlap">your blood</u>
<u n="959" who="S0421">do you think you'd have to <trunc>decom</trunc></u>
<u n="960" who="S0423" trans="overlap">no er <pause dur="short"/> yeah well er well you have to be <pause dur="short"/> pressurised <unclear>something</unclear></u>
<u n="961" who="S0421" trans="overlap">oh like in a plane? like in a plane</u>
<u n="962" who="S0423" trans="overlap"><unclear>to be in a submarine</unclear> don't you? yeah <pause dur="short"/> so that's when the divers are going <pause dur="short"/> if they've been down for hours they have to go into a decompression unit</u>
<u n="963" who="S0421">oh</u>
<u n="964" who="S0423">which then the pressure's controlled in that <pause dur="short"/> area they they spend it so they have to kind of pretty much <pause dur="short"/> they may live in there <pause dur="short"/> if they're doing diving over a couple of weeks</u>
<u n="965" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="966" who="S0423">then when they come up they stay there and sleep there <pause dur="short"/> and when they're okay they go back down for another dive so it's kind of <pause dur="short"/> think it'd be <pause dur="short"/> it's quite highly paid doing that job</u>
<u n="967" who="S0421">yeah well it'd be dangerous wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="968" who="S0423">well yeah it must be <pause dur="long"/> <anon type="place"/> we're in <anon type="place"/> now</u>
<u n="969" who="S0421">oh <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if I'd go in a submarine</u>
