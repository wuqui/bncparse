<u n="19" who="S0208">no <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s a nice size <pause dur="short"/> it's not too big</u>
<u n="20" who="S0202"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had a complex though when we first got together that er <pause dur="short"/> he thought he was small</u>
<u n="21" who="S0208">oh</u>
<u n="22" who="S0202">like he thought it like cos he said he's obviously seen other boys' penises when they've been in showers and that and his just seemed small I comparison</u>
<u n="23" who="S0208">oh but to be completely honest I'd rather have a guy with a slightly smaller than average penis than a slightly bigger because can you imagine? A it's painful</u>
<u n="24" who="S0202" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="25" who="S0208">B it stretches you out</u>
<u n="26" who="S0202">yeah</u>

<u n="29" who="S0208">get in places</u>

<u n="31" who="S0208">that a bigger penis couldn't</u>
<u n="32" who="S0202">yeah well the he isn't small <pause dur="short"/> but like it it took us like being together for two years before he'd tell me what his complex were</u>
<u n="33" who="S0208" trans="overlap">oh bless him</u>
<u n="34" who="S0202">and then after that I just used to take piss out of him like ha ha small dick</u>
<u n="35" who="S0208"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="36" who="S0202">and he he got over it straight away</u>

<u n="38" who="S0202">like <trunc>th</trunc>the that's how I get rid of all his like insecurities like just take the piss out of him <pause dur="short"/> and straight away he's like ha ha funny</u>
<u n="39" who="S0208">that's good</u>
<u n="40" who="S0202">but I I think that is the way to deal with it like if you've got an insecurity about yourself take the piss out of it like that's why I take the piss out of my manly voice and like my big nose like when that fly landed on it like</u>
<u n="41" who="S0208">that's what I do with my forehead</u>
<u n="42" who="S0202" trans="overlap">do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0208" trans="overlap">making jokes about flying to China</u>
<u n="44" who="S0202">yeah</u>

<u n="46" who="S0202">well if they did it viciously</u>
<u n="47" who="S0208">but I do it myself it's like even when people do it as a joke I still find it helpful cos I'm like I'm the only person that can laugh about that you're not allowed to <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="48" who="S0202">I'm allowed cos I'm your best friend I've got a <unclear/> so</u>
<u n="49" who="S0208">mm</u>

<u n="54" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/> like a drug cartel person <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> but yeah like I've got so many insecurities and I just deal with it by taking the piss out of it like</u>
<u n="55" who="S0208" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0202">everyone people say to me oh you should do blah-blah and like yeah maybe I am but it's a personal thing and</u>
<u n="57" who="S0208" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0202">my way of dealing with it is taking the piss out of it</u>
<u n="59" who="S0208">it's like people who you look at and you think are absolutely perfect they still have insecurities</u>
<u n="60" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0208">and just cos you don't see them doesn't mean they're not there <pause dur="short"/> it's like I was telling you how <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s really insecure about her body because she finds it too slim and stuff it's like you would never look at her and think she was insecure</u>
<u n="62" who="S0202">no</u>
<u n="63" who="S0208">but she is</u>
<u n="64" who="S0202" trans="overlap">I would never tell her she has an amazing body either <vocal desc="laugh"/> only cos I'm jealous</u>
<u n="65" who="S0208">she wouldn't even accept it</u>
<u n="66" who="S0202">I know she wouldn't</u>
<u n="67" who="S0208" trans="overlap">I've tried several times I've just been like do you know how beautiful you are and she's literally just like shut up and she gets quite vicious about it</u>
<u n="68" who="S0202">mm <pause dur="long"/> you're right about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> though she has changed a lot</u>

<u n="73" who="S0208" trans="overlap">yeah so I think what with getting the job and sort of kind of moving out of her family home <pause dur="short"/> it's changed her in so many good ways see what I mean though when I was like now I spend so much time with her because she's just such an easy person to be with</u>
<u n="74" who="S0202">yeah <pause dur="short"/> why ain't she been here over the last week or so?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0208">I don't know like she's going to England <pause dur="short"/> er on Thursday <pause dur="short"/> so I sent her a message and I was just like look if you want to get together before you go it would be lovely to see you and I said I'm baby sitting on Wednesday and that you're going Wednesday afternoon so she's free to come <pause dur="short"/> whenever</u>
<u n="76" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0208">so we're not doing much because she could still</u>
<u n="78" who="S0202">she could still come like</u>
<u n="79" who="S0208" trans="overlap">just shall I send her a message and see if she wants to come over and watch a film or something?</u>

<u n="82" who="S0202" trans="overlap">not that she was were a dickhead before but she were just annoying like cos she was just so immature but like she has really calmed down and I actually really like her</u>
<u n="83" who="S0208">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I really hope that she will come over to England next year to visit cos she didn't this year obviously cos of her job</u>
<u n="84" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0208">but also I sort of put her off a bit by saying just wait until next year it'll be better cos I <pause dur="short"/> people did come over and visit but like I felt awkward enough with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because I tried warning her about the situation and nothing prepared her like she was still like I'm I'm genuinely shocked at the fact that you don't get on with any of your flatmates and like your food situation and stuff</u>
<u n="86" who="S0202">yeah</u>
