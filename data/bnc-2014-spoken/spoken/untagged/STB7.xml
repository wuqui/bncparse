<u n="1001" who="S0008">that's right</u>

<u n="1011" who="S0008">you know got decent sketch book or you just sort of flick through and check this check that oh right you know and</u>

<u n="1616" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="1617" who="S0012">that's pathetic</u>
<u n="1618" who="S0008">mm</u>

<u n="1620" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="1621" who="S0012">er six by six by four photo <trunc>pa</trunc> framing for around about ten pence each</u>
<u n="1622" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="1623" who="S0012"><trunc>whi</trunc>which is pretty cheap but you have to buy an enormous amount to get them for that you know</u>
<u n="1624" who="S0008">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="1625" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1626" who="S0008">yeah but them photo books I mean <pause dur="short"/> they're quite good you know they're quite reasonable quality</u>
<u n="1627" who="S0012">they are yeah</u>
<u n="1628" who="S0008">but I think they're overpriced for what they</u>
<u n="1629" who="S0012">they are yeah</u>
<u n="1630" who="S0008">when you consider it's like <pause dur="short"/> I'll bet you there's nobody the only person in a factory there is the person who's packing them up and posting them</u>
<u n="1631" who="S0012">yeah probably yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1632" who="S0008">you know it probably comes with a pre-printed stick or in a bag that's the right size and they just put them in a bag put the sticker on chuck them out</u>
<u n="1633" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="long"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1634" who="S0013">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1635" who="S0008">cos I think there's totally automated process</u>
<u n="1636" who="S0012">that must be yeah</u>
<u n="1637" who="S0008">and you know when you think about the volume they actually use</u>
<u n="1638" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1639" who="S0008">you know they must have paid for them machines a hundred times over</u>
<u n="1640" who="S0012">they must have done now yeah</u>
<u n="1641" who="S0008">you know</u>
<u n="1642" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="1643" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1644" who="S0008">cos the thing is is that it you know they look fairly good but the actual hard cover is nothing special is it</u>
<u n="1645" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="1646" who="S0008">you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="1647" who="S0012">well you can pay for the you pay extra for certain covers</u>
<u n="1648" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1649" who="S0008">yeah but I mean that's only different sort of sort of material or fabric or something like that</u>
<u n="1650" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1651" who="S0008">but you know the actual you know cos I was looking at the stuff which like the arts college</u>
<u n="1652" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1653" who="S0008">cos they've got their own sort of bookbinding thing</u>
<u n="1654" who="S0012">oh I see yeah</u>
<u n="1655" who="S0008">but <pause dur="short"/> in in the sort of final year exhibitions you know quite a few people partly think it's to make a book</u>
<u n="1656" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1657" who="S0008">of the design and the</u>
<u n="1658" who="S0012">that's it yeah</u>
<u n="1659" who="S0008"><trunc>pr</trunc> especially in the the clothing bit or whatever it is textile bit</u>
<u n="1660" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1661" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1662" who="S0008">and you look at them and they're really good quality bindings on them books</u>
<u n="1663" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1664" who="S0008">you know they are really well done</u>
<u n="1665" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1666" who="S0013">mm right</u>
<u n="1667" who="S0008">and I don't think they pay</u>
<u n="1668" who="S0012">but you won't them for to last don't you if you're going to pay that sort of money for them</u>
<u n="1669" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah you do</u>
<u n="1670" who="S0008">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="1671" who="S0012">I mean that's no good having a binding that's going to fall to bits</u>
<u n="1672" who="S0008">that's right</u>
<u n="1673" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="1674" who="S0012">after a few usages you know <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="1675" who="S0008">well I was thinking of putting you know getting a photo album and just printing pictures of and put them in right</u>
<u n="1676" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1677" who="S0008">and I've started printing pictures and I'm sort of looking for you know just like the you used to get like a book you know when you open it and it's you know you can put your photos in that</u>
<u n="1678" who="S0012">that's it you did yeah</u>
