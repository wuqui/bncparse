<u n="577" who="S0637">and you used to call them bottle changers didn't diagnose the problem just swapped out the valves until it started working which is what the majority of people do now they go oh well the fault's on this board so I'm gonna change the board not gonna find out which component has gone wrong on the board they just throw the whole board away a new board a new TV board for that is probably two hundred quid <pause dur="short"/> where you can fix it for fifty P <vocal desc="laugh"/> mm</u>

<u n="582" who="S0636">just put it on the back and he'd have a little carrying on thing and we had a record player wind up one</u>

<u n="586" who="S0636">no if you wound it full up that would last for one record but and when I first got my first little record player I think that was a Dansette and you could actually play <unclear/> on it and forty-fives you know</u>
<u n="587" who="S0632">cool</u>
<u n="588" who="S0636">yeah and put a couple of records on so they dropped down you know and thinking oh lovely</u>
<u n="589" who="S0637">you know record players used to have four speeds didn't they? <pause dur="short"/> there was seventy-eight forty-five thirty-three and sixteen</u>

<u n="606" who="S0636">they have a lot of people buy them and play them because they reckon that the sound of an old record is a lot better than you get off a tape or a CD</u>

<u n="619" who="S0637">it sounds sounds more realistic or no no it doesn't no you've got scratches you've got rumbles you've got distortion it does not sound more realistic than a digital recording no it doesn't you may prefer the way it sounds</u>
<u n="620" who="S0632">because of the nostalgia</u>

<u n="625" who="S0637">I won't criticise you for that but don't tell me it's better because it's not it is not more realistic absolutely not but people'll like valve amplifiers because they have a warmer sound yeah that warmer sound has a word it's called distortion</u>
<u n="626" who="S0632">so the warmness of the fuzzy sound</u>
<u n="627" who="S0637">yes</u>

<u n="629" who="S0637">yeah</u>
<u n="630" who="S0632">I think you can get things like gold tone and silver tone and</u>
<u n="631" who="S0637">right</u>
<u n="632" who="S0632" trans="overlap">and that depends whether it's been run through gold or silver</u>

<u n="637" who="S0637">yeah</u>
<u n="638" who="S0632">is that is that a real thing that it can sound silver or it can sound gold?</u>

<u n="645" who="S0637" trans="overlap">monster monster cables you can get a cable to run from your TV to your DVD player your HDMI cable you can go and buy one of those and you can get one in a pound shop for a pound or you can go to somewhere that sells monster cables and you can buy exactly the same cable for four hundred and fifty pounds</u>

<u n="651" who="S0637">whatsoever because it's digital it either works or it doesn't work there's no grey area in between there's no improvement in sound quality or picture quality or anything like that it works or it doesn't so if you pay a pound for it brilliant if you pay four hundred and fifty quid for it I'd like to meet you and you can become one of my customers and</u>

<u n="653" who="S0637">and you know I'll I'll put a little knob on the front of your computer that'll go up to eleven so it goes faster than everyone else's computer and I'll charge you four thousand pounds for that it'll just be a little knob that's not connected to anything but you'll think it goes faster</u>

<u n="656" who="S0632">thank you very much</u>
<u n="657" who="S0636">but it's the same with anything isn't it? clothes anything or some people will pay thousands for something you can get at another shop for a tenner and have just as good</u>
<u n="658" who="S0637">well the I mean that's</u>
<u n="659" who="S0636" trans="overlap">it's just all these <trunc>p</trunc>people who have got money what brag don't they? I've got so much money and I</u>
<u n="660" who="S0637" trans="overlap">but it's a that's a subjective thing though isn't it? I mean you know you you might wanna pay more for something that has I dunno a a higher thread count you know a cotton with a higher thread count for example</u>
<u n="661" who="S0636">mm</u>
<u n="662" who="S0637">that is undoubtedly a better quality than something you'd get out of Primark or or or or Matalan or something like that and <trunc>i</trunc>it will probably last longer it's probably put together a bit better and you're paying more for that but when you're talking about the actual physics of a cable there is no <trunc>d</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc>if it works it works exactly the same as the one pound cable as a four hundred and fifty pound cable that is entirely objective</u>

<u n="664" who="S0637">the <vocal desc="laugh"/> you have to be an a complete imbecile to believe otherwise</u>
<u n="665" who="S0632">mm yeah I was wondering about the gold and silver tone thing because I thought it was to do with like electric guitars and stuff and it was to do with the electronics part of it but I know that you have silver band and brass band</u>
<u n="666" who="S0637">mm it may may just be a term they use for different sound processes that er that it goes through</u>
<u n="667" who="S0632">maybe</u>

<u n="669" who="S0632" trans="overlap">I thought it was the actual precious metals though</u>
<u n="670" who="S0637">no I mean gold gold is used in connectors</u>
<u n="671" who="S0632">yeah</u>
<u n="672" who="S0637">because gold has a very low electrical resistance and it doesn't tarnish so it's really good for high frequency stuff I'm not talking <trunc>ab</trunc> not audio frequency I'm talking about radio frequency because radio frequencies tend to go round the outside of the conductor whereas low frequencies and DC goes through the whole conductor the high frequency though tends to go on the outside now if you've got corrosion round the outside that's gonna attenuate the higher frequencies cos they've got they've got a resistive path to go through <pause dur="short"/> which is why er the er broadband for example erm it's er it's on a standard copper pair so if that copper pair is sheathed normally it's been it's oxygen-free and you know</u>
<u n="673" who="S0632">yeah</u>
<u n="674" who="S0637">your actual broadband signal is a high frequency signal that comes down that so the voice <trunc>b</trunc>basically your voice signal comes through the middle of the wire a <trunc>s</trunc> a solid copper wire but you know broadband internet signal is modulated at a much higher frequency and that tends by its nature to go around the outside of the cable which is fine on a sheathed copper cable because it's nice shiny copper and it works you go somewhere like Milton Keynes new city they put in aluminium wires for the telephones</u>
<u n="675" who="S0632">yeah</u>
<u n="676" who="S0637">in the nineteen sixties when they built it because it was cheaper easier to use lighter <trunc>th</trunc>there was no there was no downside with it it was great and it was brilliant for for telephony but the problem with aluminium as soon the instant it comes into contact with air it oxidises so you couldn't get broadband in Milton Keynes cos it was aluminium wires</u>
<u n="677" who="S0632">oh</u>
<u n="678" who="S0637">so they had to replace all the aluminium</u>
