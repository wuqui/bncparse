<u n="129" who="S0157">then I can get an iPhone</u>
<u n="130" who="S0041">oh it's not too bad</u>
<u n="131" who="S0157" trans="overlap">I'm gonna get an iPhone</u>

<u n="134" who="S0157">I'm so excited</u>
<u n="135" who="S0041">yeah I really want an iPhone <pause dur="short"/> actually I don't I want the Samsung Galaxy back</u>
<u n="136" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="137" who="S0041">after it died at New Year <pause dur="short"/> it just ran away from me</u>
<u n="138" who="S0084">the Samsung</u>

<u n="140" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0041">but I like them better than the iPhone <pause dur="short"/> I think cos they're a bit more like the way they work is more intuitive than the iPhone whereas the iPhone have their own way of working don't they</u>
<u n="142" who="S0157">yeah I'm a bit uh</u>
<u n="143" who="S0084">like if you've had Apple products before then it's it's fine</u>
<u n="144" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0084">but I think there's probably quite a learning curve there</u>
<u n="146" who="S0157">I think it's gonna take me a while</u>
<u n="147" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> jord's got one though and I've had a play on it and there's it's not it's rare that I'll get stuck and go what've I pressed here? </u>
<u n="148" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0157">mm</u>
<u n="150" who="S0041">so they can't be that bad</u>
<u n="151" who="S0084">I love them <pause dur="short"/> but to go from nothing to an iPhone is expensive <pause dur="short"/> like <unclear/> recording tracks</u>
<u n="152" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0157">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0084">and obviously because my phone is about a million years old and it's worth ten pounds um on Mazuma mobile um I've got nothing to go towards a phone so unless I get a contract that's forty pounds a month I have to pay two hundred pounds for the new phone <pause dur="short"/> and if I get a contract that's thirty pounds a month I'd still have to pay like a hundred pounds for the phone and it would still be thirty pounds on my contract and</u>
<u n="155" who="S0041">oh God</u>
<u n="156" who="S0084">so I just think there's just so unless my until my phone dies there's no uh incentive for me to do it</u>
<u n="157" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="158" who="S0084">apart from the fact that it's beautiful</u>

<u n="571" who="S0084"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="572" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and then the worst part was like cos they it was teaching like anything from thirteen to eighteen it wasn't consistent either so he's having to chop and change subjects</u>
<u n="573" who="S0157">yeah</u>
<u n="574" who="S0041">chop and change levels and sometimes you can re-use stuff in classes but very rarely cos it wasn't</u>
<u n="575" who="S0157">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="576" who="S0041">it was just light uh</u>
<u n="577" who="S0157">yeah at least I've <trunc>g</trunc> just got just the one class</u>

<u n="579" who="S0157">yeah</u>
<u n="580" who="S0041"><unclear/> organise it</u>

<u n="589" who="S0157">so you couldn't just do your own thing you'd have to you have to plan with them</u>
<u n="590" who="S0084">oh so there's another class for that year group</u>
<u n="591" who="S0157">yeah and they kind of encourage you to change the plans anyway like from one year to the next year you have to adapt it for the children you've got and so it wouldn't be I mean it still would eventually if you stayed in the same school and taught the same year for a few years yeah it would get easier</u>
