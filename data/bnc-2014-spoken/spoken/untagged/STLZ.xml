<u n="1" who="S0261">erm okay yeah so <pause dur="short"/> I I like er I'm trying to kind of get a bigger strategic picture over what we're really entering into <pause dur="short"/> erm and er <pause dur="short"/> maybe I'm just being trying to move too fast but I get that feeling that we need to move fast so erm I'd rather do that <pause dur="short"/> and so if we're talking about personal learning networks er one model that I could see that would benefit people is connecting students with what the business world is and doing that before they enter the business world <pause dur="short"/> and so personal learning networks become a an extension of what they're doing er and what they integrate is this connection with <pause dur="short"/> the real world <pause dur="short"/> yeah? so they do these studies and there's a practical thing that they do erm they do this summer work or their holiday work and the majority of students don't <pause dur="short"/> I think don't get experience in what they they're working at what the what the they're training in what</u>
<u n="2" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no they're not</u>
<u n="3" who="S0261" trans="overlap">they're educating in</u>
<u n="4" who="S0262">the most of the time they're trying to earn money part-time work</u>
<u n="5" who="S0261">right okay so erm <pause dur="short"/> so going beyond they might still have to learn earn money but it doesn't mean to say they should stop studying while they're on holiday <pause dur="short"/> okay? so if you put it a different way they should be developing their personal <trunc>net</trunc> learning network such that regardless of whether they're working in a a job or a role that is related to what they're doing they should be trying to to to to find mechanisms to build experience that is somehow connected to that</u>
<u n="6" who="S0262">yeah no I agree and that's a</u>
<u n="7" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and and that but from their point of view <trunc>y</trunc> doing some they might not get the picture of doing something in a community based thing with some role of responsibility <pause dur="short"/> they might not understand that that is quite heavily connected to doing a role of business yeah? <pause dur="short"/> so let's say they were er had a small leadership role</u>
<u n="8" who="S0262">well I</u>
<u n="9" who="S0261" trans="overlap">had a little project to run</u>
<u n="10" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0261" trans="overlap">all of that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="12" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0261">so you're trying to map things that they you know <trunc>wh</trunc> which can be perceived as a ethereal but if you can demonstrate the connection or value</u>
<u n="14" who="S0262">if they can explain it to us then that means that if <trunc>y</trunc> if they can explain it we can talk about it and interview other people about it</u>
<u n="15" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="16" who="S0262" trans="overlap">so the idea is erm I would say is to go and put your eye in some cold water and you will get rid of what's bothering your eyeball cos the way you flush out your eye is just by getting some cold water and just flushing out the thing in your eye</u>
<u n="17" who="S0261">okay alright erm <pause dur="long"/> starting to feel like Mickey Rourke <pause dur="long"/> okay erm <pause dur="short"/> I'm just trying to think of a bigger picture thing which is er</u>
<u n="18" who="S0262">well I actually had a brainwave today while you're kind of</u>
<u n="19" who="S0261" trans="overlap">oh okay well I know what you yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0262" trans="overlap">trying to articulate what you're saying</u>
<u n="21" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0262">erm look I'm only bringing this to your awareness a because you are <pause dur="short"/> like making your own personal learning network</u>
<u n="23" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="24" who="S0262">so now you have the terminology to talk about it and write about it other people will be interested in what you're doing <pause dur="short"/> because it is on the fringes yeah?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0261">okay</u>
<u n="26" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it won't be a it won't be an it won't be a term that most people are aware of what that means</u>
<u n="27" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="28" who="S0262">erm and it also means that the students themselves when you when you ask questions like Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday if we still run with that idea that there is a personal learning network that's being exposed and the idea is to move away from networking or social networking yes we know that what it is but we need to show learners of any age that actually what they're doing in this new way of using people in real life but also connecting over the internet is a way of just shaping your personal learning network and the reason why it's called a personal learning network is because there is some theory that backs it up yeah and that the reason why we use that as a framing question is because we need something that's different from all the other websites out there <pause dur="short"/> you know we need to be talking in a in a forum of something other <pause dur="short"/> yeah?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yes exactly we need to we either need to be working in a niche that exists or create a new one</u>
<u n="30" who="S0262">it I think create a new one and and especially bring in other ideas from where people are on the fringes they're <trunc>educat</trunc> educators they are perhaps even parents even but they're aware of something happening with their children</u>
<u n="31" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and those children turn into young adults and those young adults turn into adults so all we're doing is jumping in on a on a on a sequence of somebody's life and it doesn't really matter what age they are but I mean a and originally you started going younger adults erm mainly because I think they were drawing a bigger crowd but <trunc>f</trunc> maybe not you know what we've now got is this idea of a personal learning network bringing in anybody of any age as long as they're part of your personal learning network and you can explain why they are</u>
<u n="33" who="S0261">okay so what I think I would <trunc>pre</trunc> prefer to approach it with would be you start at university and we were talking about this idea of a peer to peer connection</u>
<u n="34" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0261">okay as a as a learning thing erm and that you would take people who who are near they've just they've left university fairly close by yeah erm and er in my experience typically what happens is people walk out of university and they don't go back <pause dur="short"/> that's it</u>
<u n="36" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0261" trans="overlap">they don't pass on any knowledge there's no there's a total disconnect okay?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0262">that</u>
<u n="39" who="S0261" trans="overlap">they just get on with I'm gonna go and live my life</u>
<u n="40" who="S0262">most people yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0262">most people</u>
<u n="43" who="S0261">so</u>
<u n="44" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0261">so but however those people have their own personal learning network and typically it's it's a continuation of what they've been doing at university because a lot of people will enter into some kind of professional growth thing with work okay? they've got something to learn to bridge a gap to actually operate effectively in a business</u>
<u n="46" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0261">okay erm so that kind of tranche of people makes sense to me that you can connect these two together quite effectively <pause dur="short"/> erm and then you can take people who are perceived to be experts or people who might be role models that you can supplant as a er as an overall connector for everyone</u>
<u n="48" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0261">just a thought but</u>
<u n="50" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah no that's right</u>
<u n="51" who="S0261" trans="overlap">I initially when you were talking about this idea of just working in the university students I was a bit kind of well it becomes quite constrained</u>
<u n="52" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0261">and although it is a niche and it's a well-defined niche erm I I think we would have to think <trunc>s</trunc> very specifically about how how you're accessing people's dollars if you want to get some money from them you know for paying for products et cetera</u>
<u n="54" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well I I thought about this today and I think erm we can certainly start off erm with university students as the primary audience but the thing about it is that if we were using this idea of making a moving image as a case study and the people who were in the case study are actually using their own likeness you know they are a part of the case study they agree they wanna co-create they want to earn some money from co-creating a product erm and then the idea is that once you've got these niche products I think I've understood what this is all about in terms of scalability <pause dur="short"/> you hone the skill you are not necessarily selling you can sell those products but what you're going to sell up in the scale of things is the the know-how of how to do that cos I just realised when I was talking to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> today that he was talking about Qantas as a case study <pause dur="short"/> and he was saying so if you have like you know the CEO the this this the that and the other all these people who are trying to organise Qantas and make it better erm you'd need access to these real life people okay to make it authentic and then you could put it across as this is the problem what theories do you need to use management theories to you know solve the problem? so I've just realised that the way you can scale it up is by working away at the beginning chipping it out as a product but then actually going to much bigger companies and going this is what we do <pause dur="short"/> this is how we can make it it's almost like a corporate video but it's called a corporate case study <pause dur="short"/> and this is the reason why we can do it is because we've been chipping away at this area where we've learnt about them the students and the knowledge base and pitching it at the right level for the students cos the students will be your customers <pause dur="short"/> cos you'll sell this into say for example <pause dur="short"/> an educational well</u>
<u n="55" who="S0261" trans="overlap">well well it can be <unclear>resembling</unclear> a subscription model where people or a membership thing you know a whole range of different gatekeepers that you can create to bring people into a paid community</u>
<u n="56" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0261">whether it's that you have your your your your core erm er let's call it your your marketing blog presentation all of that that is your that is your your outward look for your business and beside that you can have er a membership community which is people who want something extra go to that community okay? <pause dur="short"/> that could be that could be a tangible you get access to it erm a a a coherent network of people who do X Y Z or whatever</u>
<u n="58" who="S0262">you're right look you could work it out on so many different levels I'm just telling you where the scalability comes from</u>
<u n="59" who="S0261">okay carry on</u>
<u n="60" who="S0262" trans="overlap">if you're talking about big dollars</u>
<u n="61" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="62" who="S0262">and people are stupid enough to spend shitloads of money on crap stuff which they are at the moment I've talked to another <trunc>ed</trunc> a number of educational designers and the money that's flying around in certain universities at the moment is just stupid money they need content they are not a production house that's not what they're there for <pause dur="short"/> they need content and they need relevant content that will sell on to their client base which is a young audience basically <pause dur="short"/> so they're gonna run out of ideas very soon I was talking to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> on the train she said it's not about sticking an <trunc>acad</trunc> academic in front of a at a fucking computer er sorry camera</u>
<u n="63" who="S0261">camera yeah yeah I know that</u>
<u n="64" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and getting them to talk at the camera that's that's old style MOOC</u>
<u n="65" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="66" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's not where we're going we're going further much further than that <pause dur="short"/> we're gonna go into the realm of edu-tainment education plus tainment gets the punters to part with their money</u>
<u n="67" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0262">so even if the universities won't touch it with a bargepole because it's too ooh it's left of centre MOOCs will and if MOOCs start to change into something other we'll be there with product and content to keep filling it <pause dur="short"/> and we should be ahead of the eight ball because we've already started the know-how of how to make this happen because I think this format that we have in mind is quite unusual <pause dur="short"/> I think the idea of actually letting real life people drive their own narrative and wanna be a co-creators and earn money from that that's where everyone benefits <pause dur="short"/> the point is they'll earn royalties <pause dur="short"/> what more of an incentive do you fucking want?</u>
<u n="69" who="S0261">carry on</u>
<u n="70" who="S0262">and not all of them will sell some of them won't some of them will be really good and they'll sell well so you'll have your cash cows and you'll have your sort of slightly random ones</u>
<u n="71" who="S0261">well that's what you're testing and that's what you're trying out as you go <pause dur="short"/>  erm <pause dur="short"/> so if one's to start somewhere we we really have to kind of get down this kind of idea of we need to do some some market market research <pause dur="short"/> we we need to create something that we can then use to explore certain things</u>
<u n="72" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0261">so erm you can go out and <pause dur="short"/> do boring old surveys but as you say people aren't that interested in surveys <pause dur="short"/> er er I think a better mechanism of trying to find out more information is by writing stuff <pause dur="short"/> publishing it online like a blog or whatever erm and encouraging people to get involved and to comment on it and that's where you get your information out of the <trunc>f</trunc> the the feedback that they're writing between each other or about something on on the <pause dur="short"/> on the content yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0262">maybe</u>
<u n="75" who="S0261">because you can see it's quite easy to er find a storyline within all of that</u>
<u n="76" who="S0262">yeah I suppose you're right but that would take some time to generate won't it?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0261">well you need to do that anyway because this is a a keen mechanism on how to get traffic into your site okay? so you need to put yourself out there as the the relative expert</u>
<u n="78" who="S0262">alright</u>
<u n="79" who="S0261">okay</u>
<u n="80" who="S0262" trans="overlap">okay alright okay so I'll <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="81" who="S0261" trans="overlap">so you can start on any thread but the <trunc>con</trunc> the idea is we need to be building up some information that people are then drawn to yeah?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0262" trans="overlap">okay so I wrote something the other day</u>
<u n="83" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0262">erm that I can show you and the students tomorrow</u>
<u n="85" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0262">erm which it says dear university teacher and then what what we'd like from our learning is this and then it it puts through some ideas about what kind of learning should be happening at university so I was thinking of showing to the students tomorrow and seeing if they agree and wanna add something to it so it's starting a thread by a letter a letter that goes to dear university teacher and it's signed from university student so it's no names attached</u>
<u n="87" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0262">it's just a get the ball rolling</u>
<u n="89" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm yeah mm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0262">and I was thinking in that they might be something that you know students might get drawn to where they go yeah yeah that is what we want or no no no we want more of this so you are beginning to find out what they think they want from their learning <pause dur="short"/> and then once you've got that kind of ball rolling maybe there is a narrative coming through about or trending we want more this we want less that you know?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0261">and in terms of the way you you'd be writing it erm is is the context of of <trunc>wh</trunc> what the recent history is or what the recent now is</u>
<u n="92" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0261">what the <trunc>fu</trunc> recent future should be like <pause dur="short"/> and what you you provide them at the end of it all is the how do we join this together?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0261">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so I like your idea it doesn't have to be written like that to present to people but if they can get the thread of it then they'll provide you the stuff which is the bit that you tell them at the end</u>
<u n="96" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I think <pause dur="short"/> one thing that you know I keep coming back round to again is that I think what we're really trying to tell young people is that employers <pause dur="short"/>  there's two things that employers will look for and they may not be able to articulate it but they I'm pretty sure they're looking for it creative problem solvers most of the time <pause dur="short"/> and secondly that you're adaptable and adaptation means you learn how to adapt it's about learning how to adapt and that requires you to be a learner <pause dur="short"/> most of the time</u>
<u n="97" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and hence and hence have your your own personal learning network</u>
<u n="98" who="S0262" trans="overlap">personal learning network yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0261">mm yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0262">so if those two things are the way that the students and I you know are framing we don't confuse the waters er confuse people too much with too many terms we're just basically going what are you watching? you're watching people creatively solve problems this is a dialogue of Monday to Tuesday to Wednesday and what are they doing every single time we interview them is they're adding part of the solution <pause dur="short"/> how are they doing that? by communicating</u>
<u n="101" who="S0261">mm yes yeah yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0262">and that's where you get the case study material from</u>
<u n="103" who="S0261">and I've just thought of another thing about erm a connection and that is with employers <pause dur="short"/> and a big thing that you I mean you just hear it said but whether it actually is is another thing and that is er this kind of common commentary about students who come out of university or gen Y students don't fit the bill for the employers that they seem to be falling short of the <trunc>expecta</trunc> expectations now whether that's a a just a a common difference that always exists or whether there is a relative difference with what we might be considered for our generation versus theirs I don't know but you do hear that so <pause dur="short"/> part of your research you could say is well find a a a bundle of of employers and ask them what they think</u>
<u n="104" who="S0262">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> absolutely you could do that</u>
<u n="105" who="S0261">and then what you can you're effectively doing is you're you're joining <trunc>t</trunc> two problems together one which is <trunc>y</trunc> you there's a problem here that exists before you even get there <pause dur="short"/> that you that you need to be aware of</u>
<u n="106" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and that you need that's what what you're trying to provide the student is the mechanism to shine above what this problem is</u>
<u n="108" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and then at the student end they've got their problem which is that they're expected to try and learn within an institution that <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> er hasn't yet matured in such a way in context of what future learning's going to be</u>
<u n="110" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0261">so they're in a</u>
<u n="112" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0261">transition period</u>
<u n="114" who="S0262">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0261">where they've actually got this this common fuss and and and chaos and erm probably they've got expectations that they're not having met <pause dur="short"/> so that's their they actually have something in common with the employers</u>
<u n="116" who="S0262">true</u>
<u n="117" who="S0261">and and one might be able to join this all together and say well actually don't look at the students it's not the students it's the people that are teaching them <pause dur="short"/> so business go and talk to them don't <pause dur="short"/> forget about the students it's not their fault</u>
<u n="118" who="S0262">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's a it's a it's a it's a pretty powerful erm message that's getting sent to the institutions but you know the I was talking to an educational developer who worked at <anon type="place"/> for three years and now working here she's got quite a good job here in <anon type="place"/> erm she's one of the head sort of developers and she said look it's not about video video is just a way to convey information <pause dur="short"/> it's what you do with the video and the learning that goes around it that surrounds it that takes place that's where you need to put your energy <pause dur="short"/> she said I've tried talking to you know people up the top about this and they're not interested she said but one thing I do know is that eventually the students will vote with their feet <pause dur="short"/> they are becoming more price-conscious they are becoming more savvy about how to decide which courses to do and it only takes a few real websites that are big for the students to keep always going to to check out where the courses are and who's doing the most sort of enticing learning at the moment that's all it needs and then boom students will know where they wanna go and why and I and I can see that happening I mean I know I'm saying I'm sealing the idea that we're gonna have a big website but again I'm looking at the scalability of it is that <pause dur="short"/> once you've got the dialogue going in the right way and you've got something that's changing that's interesting you are learning something from it you can buy something from it too is that <pause dur="short"/> you'll keep going back as long as the stories are fresh appealing being driven by the user and not</u>
<u n="119" who="S0261" trans="overlap">the there's a adaptation in it</u>
<u n="120" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0262">and that's actually living and breathing what we're saying we do</u>
<u n="123" who="S0261">yes <pause dur="short"/> exactly and I I was thinking also initially I was thinking well part of the problem is that these students they're not students forever they go through the system and then they move on</u>
<u n="124" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0261">and so you've got this kind of continual thing of of of of er you you start somewhere down here and you learn to a certain level and then that experience is lost from our point of view as well <pause dur="short"/> and that's why we're interested in trying to continue a connection <pause dur="short"/> beyond their university time because <pause dur="short"/> because we would be continuing to learn about the reality of this new connection</u>
<u n="126" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0261">yeah that that we need to understand whether there is a benefit that is then provided to business as an example <pause dur="short"/> erm and it's very tangible to connect this kind of <pause dur="short"/> journey path together</u>
<u n="128" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0261">in a more proactive and positive way</u>
<u n="130" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0261">and you can certainly get employers interested in what you're doing</u>
<u n="132" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0261">and you can say well this is <pause dur="short"/> this is where we side here and this is where we side here <pause dur="short"/> and we are the medium that joins the two together</u>
<u n="134" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0261">and the the the thing I do like about it the antithesis of what I'm talking about is that <pause dur="short"/> you always have a continuous flow of new people coming into the system</u>
<u n="136" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> and they're connected</u>
<u n="137" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="138" who="S0262">in a way by the time that you've kind of you know gone through this <trunc>pr</trunc> this format that's that's gonna be a real skill to get <pause dur="short"/> going but if you can get that know-how really professional <pause dur="short"/> that you can scale up</u>
<u n="139" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="140" who="S0262" trans="overlap">people will come to your website and go can you do that for me I love it</u>
<u n="141" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="142" who="S0262">I love that</u>
<u n="143" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="144" who="S0262">I want you to come into my company and do that with my people</u>
<u n="145" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="146" who="S0262">cos I wanna show my own employees a case study</u>
<u n="147" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="148" who="S0262" trans="overlap">from our real company</u>
<u n="149" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0262">please come and do that</u>
<u n="151" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="152" who="S0262">erm so there's money to be made</u>
<u n="153" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="154" who="S0262">in various different places it's just that we're gonna have to work really hard on the format and work really hard on protecting it</u>
<u n="155" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0262">cos it's so easy for somebody to come along and get a get a whiff of what is actually being done</u>
<u n="157" who="S0261">and just be <event desc="unintelligible"/></u>
<u n="158" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and just go off and create it themselves</u>
<u n="159" who="S0261">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and that comes down to erm a lot of things but erm that is part of <pause dur="short"/> you know you can kind of get this feeling that <pause dur="short"/> if you were to draw it on a piece of paper there's a kind of a rough thing there</u>
<u n="160" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0261" trans="overlap">you know</u>
<u n="162" who="S0262">it's</u>
<u n="163" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="164" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it's it's gotta be <trunc>tr</trunc> it's gotta be demoed I mean I don't know if it's possible to do but look</u>
<u n="165" who="S0261">well you <trunc>d</trunc> yeah yes you do and you do it er that's that's exactly what the lean model is about that you do a minimum version of it</u>
<u n="166" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0261">now <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> you know there are a lot of things that would need to be built in a very short amount of time if you're going to do that at some cost</u>
<u n="168" who="S0262">right well I mean what I need to talk to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and and also <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <trunc>r</trunc> about as I said not tomorrow but another time let's see how they go with making a film and everything</u>
<u n="169" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0262">tomorrow but <pause dur="short"/> erm I I need I need to know from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> how he sees the narrative working he's got quite a good sort of writing style he's quite you know free flowing with his style <trunc>ha</trunc> you er you read some of his articles erm but I need to know from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> whether <pause dur="short"/> you know things can be cut together pretty quickly</u>
<u n="171" who="S0261">er in context of video?</u>
<u n="172" who="S0262" trans="overlap">of <pause dur="short"/> yeah because I was thinking really what people are going to come along to watch is they will some people will watch Monday Tuesday Wednesday some</u>
<u n="173" who="S0261">they they want to see the <unclear>summary</unclear></u>
<u n="174" who="S0262" trans="overlap">most most people will wanna see the summary</u>
<u n="175" who="S0261">yeah well so what what you <trunc>sh</trunc> you you're talking about two different groups of people you're talking about those who intrinsically become highly connected with you and they will watch it</u>
<u n="176" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0261" trans="overlap">to to the end</u>
<u n="178" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="179" who="S0261">and then you've got the others who know I I I can't do that bit but I do like the summary that I can see on a Friday night or a Saturday morning or a Sunday or a Monday morning or whatever it is</u>
<u n="180" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0261">erm and so you're actually feeding two different crowds <pause dur="short"/> and so what you're interested in is how quickly <pause dur="short"/> can you put all this stuff together in a narrative</u>
<u n="182" who="S0262">and I was thinking if you wanna buy and get people to buy in</u>
<u n="183" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and a day</u>
<u n="184" who="S0262">to the answer so you can go here's about a minute of the problem</u>
<u n="185" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="186" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you only give them the problem but it's enticing enough to wanna know what the answer is erm so you say your learning opportunity is to solve this problem so you work on it and you think about and then when you're ready to come and have a look at it to see if your solution meets with the actual real life people's solution <pause dur="short"/> then you'll enter into the subscription you actually watch the whole of the case study and see how it plays out <pause dur="short"/> and then you can have like say people in the community are writing oh that was such a really neat way of organising people and getting the problem solved I would never have thought of that yeah well people will be going in the forum going <trunc>yea</trunc> like your forum how you're always helping people</u>
<u n="187" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0262">you know it's like yeah right okay now what you could do next is so people are just in the community they are just actually using the case study as a way to very quickly share ideas about how to solve problems because they've got something to focus on <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="189" who="S0261">and I like the idea of you you well you you can quite quickly build many communities within your community</u>
<u n="190" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="191" who="S0261">erm and some examples I'm seeing er with Location Rebel er that it's a big community there are <trunc>l</trunc> large numbers of new people coming in and I get the sense that people kind of are with the community for six to twelve months and then they go off and do their own thing</u>
<u n="192" who="S0262">oh right</u>
<u n="193" who="S0261">so they might jump back in and dabble in it</u>
<u n="194" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="195" who="S0261">but there's this continuous <pause dur="short"/> kind of refreshing going on right</u>
<u n="196" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="197" who="S0261">but what you do see er with some of the people who are experienced is that they find a mechanism which is <pause dur="short"/> the next stage up from what this is and they go and join that community</u>
<u n="198" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="199" who="S0261">or they become part of something else which meets their new level because they've already learned the base they go to the next level they go to the next level <pause dur="short"/>  erm which is kind of fits together for what I'm talking about this kind of peer to peer to peer thing</u>
<u n="200" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="201" who="S0261" trans="overlap">the learning er and some of them are doing that on a small group basis so like the hundred club <pause dur="short"/> the Hundred Dollar Club I don't know whether I told you about it</u>
<u n="202" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you did yeah</u>
<u n="203" who="S0261" trans="overlap">but I read about it</u>
<u n="204" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="205" who="S0261">erm they are they are they are eight people they are eight people and each of those eight people over the last year have been helping each other <pause dur="short"/> build each other's businesses</u>
<u n="206" who="S0262">yeah fair enough</u>
<u n="207" who="S0261">so so a similar idea that they are solving problems as a group together on a small basis of a really cosy community</u>
<u n="208" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="209" who="S0261">and producing group products as well that they're involved in as well</u>
<u n="210" who="S0262">you see what I like about trying to use the primary market as the the voice which is the student who's coming in from like university or or just graduated coming in as Monday and starting the whole ball rolling it's almost like here I'm gonna tell you my story and I'm gonna get some other people to be storytellers with me and that's the reason why they will select you know a person to interview and I will interview that person <pause dur="short"/> oh? oh yeah it's in the cupboard underneath the oven is erm I need to need to be sure that we need to transition them from just the student voice and the community into a scalable option where they're either private providers are beginning to take interest <pause dur="short"/> namely because the site is so popular and that secondly businesses might start to get interested in it because erm you know you're providing erm them with viewable content about what young people are actually doing in terms of what they're doing to get themselves ready for for the world of work and <trunc>pr</trunc> and solving problems <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="211" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and quite often there's just no transparency of that connection at all</u>
<u n="212" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no and the transition from being out on your ear after you know graduating to getting your first job is a fucking painful one <pause dur="short"/> most people find it quite hard</u>
<u n="213" who="S0261">yes yeah</u>
<u n="214" who="S0262">and it's not like your university is going to help you get a job is it? no they don't really help you get a job</u>
<u n="215" who="S0261">that's not really what they're there for</u>
<u n="216" who="S0262" trans="overlap">at all no they're not <pause dur="short"/> they say they do but they don't</u>
<u n="217" who="S0261">no and they can't get everybody a job</u>
<u n="218" who="S0262">exactly</u>
<u n="219" who="S0261" trans="overlap">because you're talking about a large scale of people</u>
<u n="220" who="S0262">yeah so I think that's a very good point that we can say as well in our in our website is no not every university is going to be able to help every individual get a job so that's why you'd come and look at these things that we're showing you</u>
<u n="221" who="S0261">well we're not offering them jobs either but we're trying to provide them</u>
<u n="222" who="S0262">with insights into what gets you a job</u>
<u n="223" who="S0261" trans="overlap">with insights into mm yeah I don't like yeah I wanna get away from it appearing to be a traditional thing</u>
<u n="224" who="S0262">no I'm just saying that there's there is you we've gotta somehow scale it <pause dur="short"/> up where <pause dur="short"/> when we're feeling kind of confident about the know-how that we've got to do it is that we can move again and about have a big jump where say you know <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <trunc>g</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> starting out with maybe <pause dur="short"/> mOOCs or finding somebody who's gonna go right now I want a package of this yeah I want a package of these little moving image case studies I want you to to put a package together and I want you wanna wanna buy it and I want it to be this long and this this kind of teaching materials you know I need to be able to go out and <pause dur="short"/> sell it on somewhere</u>
<u n="225" who="S0261">so if you to start out erm with this I <trunc>mea</trunc> I think first one we'd start with <pause dur="short"/> not that model not that model straight off</u>
<u n="226" who="S0262">no</u>
<u n="227" who="S0261">you you would be <trunc>j</trunc> just doing a an a different model which is simply interviewing some interesting students</u>
<u n="228" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="229" who="S0261">yeah? and and parallel to that you would be building er a series of these sessions these week long sessions okay?</u>
<u n="230" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="231" who="S0261">in the background and you might get them such that you've got <pause dur="short"/> a float of them you've got six of them</u>
<u n="232" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="233" who="S0261">okay? erm <pause dur="short"/> and within that half a dozen of them if you're gonna kick this off because you can you you you've got a transition and you've got this is going to be the core thing so you've got something before that a foundation before that <pause dur="short"/> and that you can er build some momentum into <trunc>th</trunc> the expectation the release of the something new</u>
<u n="234" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="235" who="S0261">you know there's something new coming guys</u>
<u n="236" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="237" who="S0261">that'd be quite interesting and you can <trunc>f</trunc> flow a few threads through er er in the upcoming kind of period and stuff <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> at but give yourself enough headway such that you've tested it you're happy with it and that within that six you can probably almost present them as the packages</u>
<u n="238" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="239" who="S0261">you were just talking about</u>
<u n="240" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="241" who="S0261">that there's a box set of six of these case studies together <pause dur="short"/> that you could then sell immediately you could go you could get to number six and say we're offering these up for sale this content up for sale</u>
<u n="242" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="243" who="S0261">and you can put a price on it and what you would do initially is the price that you would put on it would be with the aim of drawing in er a <trunc>s</trunc> more people to build your membership your user base so it would relatively be cheaper</u>
<u n="244" who="S0262">mm mm</u>
<u n="245" who="S0261" trans="overlap">because you're just starting out</u>
<u n="246" who="S0262">yeah okay that</u>
<u n="247" who="S0261" trans="overlap">that kind of yeah</u>
<u n="248" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that sounds like a good jump because you can get feedback from your market</u>
<u n="249" who="S0261"><trunc>e</trunc> exactly</u>
<u n="250" who="S0262">because if they're gonna part with five dollars or ten dollars to go and see what the answer is you know to watch the case study in its entirety erm and then er get the solution you know so it's actually kind of modelling things like critical thinking <pause dur="short"/> communication skills it's things that actually are quite tangible and you could probably take with you into your studies you know or into your job into your job so so but the thing is that you have to make that explicit to them so that they would part with their money to join the communities that they could actually tangibly use some of those ideas and use them in terms of skills but that's</u>
<u n="251" who="S0261">absolutely but you can build that</u>
<u n="252" who="S0262" trans="overlap">why we say</u>
<u n="253" who="S0261" trans="overlap">within the line of a</u>
<u n="254" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="255" who="S0261" trans="overlap">blog a Facebook</u>
<u n="256" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you can</u>
<u n="257" who="S0261" trans="overlap"><trunc>th</trunc> thing you can</u>
<u n="258" who="S0262">but you can also say</u>
<u n="259" who="S0261">let out all sorts of different ones</u>
<u n="260" who="S0262" trans="overlap">we're just part of your personal learning network</u>
<u n="261" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="262" who="S0262">we're just a a node</u>
<u n="263" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="264" who="S0262">on something you're building yourself</u>
<u n="265" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="266" who="S0262">but <trunc>w</trunc> we need <trunc>y</trunc> you need to have us as part of your personal learning network</u>
<u n="267" who="S0261">exactly</u>
<u n="268" who="S0262" trans="overlap">because we're showing you actually how to grow it</u>
<u n="269" who="S0261">mm mm</u>
<u n="270" who="S0262">so you need us we need you</u>
<u n="271" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="272" who="S0262">that sort of thing</u>
<u n="273" who="S0261">mm uh-mm</u>
<u n="274" who="S0262">and there is the some students work off the erm I I'm you know I wanna share I'm very altruistic you know I just wanna get my story out there so they're coming in going yeah I wanna be the community once you're inside the community you are then allowed to actually offer up your story I say allowed but you are invited and then you can start to shape it by thinking oh who's going to be the <trunc>inter</trunc> you know who's going to be interviewee after me? who's going to be Tuesday who's going to Wednesday? so you're already they are already driving it</u>
<u n="275" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="276" who="S0262">I mean I'm I'm convinced that there are students out there who could just drive the whole thing if you let them</u>
<u n="277" who="S0261">mm mm mm</u>
<u n="278" who="S0262">some would need more help than others <pause dur="short"/> but er as and I say <trunc>th</trunc> there will be some students' ones which will be a bit <pause dur="short"/> a bit nowhere going a bit nowhere but there'll be some that are probably fucking fascinating <pause dur="short"/> like you would never know</u>
<u n="279" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and I think that's where your skill comes is that you are seeking to erm <pause dur="short"/> erm facilitate the best result out of these sessions erm so <pause dur="short"/> er if you see something that's going slightly er awry I think you would find erm through your experience the mechanism to try and get something really good out of it</u>
<u n="280" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0261">and and <pause dur="short"/> er and this is where things like people are expecting everything to work fine <pause dur="short"/> the big message is that failure is not such a bad thing because hey guys what did we learn out of it?</u>
<u n="282" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="283" who="S0261">and there you go</u>
<u n="284" who="S0262" trans="overlap">we we don't succeed every time yeah</u>
<u n="285" who="S0261" trans="overlap">we've got all of these takeaways</u>
<u n="286" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="287" who="S0261" trans="overlap">that we can say well next time we would look at it like this and we'd look at it like that and actually erm what we've found out is this particular problem that none of us really had any awareness about</u>
<u n="288" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="289" who="S0261">and so that is a big learning message for everyone</u>
<u n="290" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="291" who="S0261">and so there's a great thing to take out of it</u>
<u n="292" who="S0262">yeah yeah yeah that's good because you you wanna get let them <trunc>t</trunc> know that it's not always gonna be that they can succeed at everything and that failure is okay as long</u>
<u n="293" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="294" who="S0262" trans="overlap">as you use it to succeed</u>
<u n="295" who="S0261">yes to build upon something</u>
<u n="296" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="297" who="S0261">for the next stage and and for a a a better solution next time</u>
<u n="298" who="S0262">yeah I've actually got some theory about how that to back that up too not that they might be all that interested in that but anyway erm so yeah I think there's you know a number of ideas worth exploring there erm and it's really gonna be finding the right people to engage with to kick it off and trial it with and you know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is er is also still a good option too because he's somebody who's graduated he's now going back to his home country we don't actually know what he's gonna do there but we could actually just run it with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> almost like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> doesn't know what's gonna happen we'll tell him a bit but not very much and we'll have to skype him from Jakarta</u>
<u n="299" who="S0261">yeah for sure</u>
<u n="300" who="S0262">and do the whole thing</u>
<u n="301" who="S0261">well the <trunc>g</trunc> the good thing about it is that you could kick <trunc>s</trunc> kick start this off with erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s an example but you can maybe you can tangibly find er another five people so you've got six erm and you can run er a thread of these people are on that you know</u>
<u n="302" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="303" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and they're trying to explore themselves through their own learning network</u>
<u n="304" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="305" who="S0261">so they are examples of the people <pause dur="short"/> we want <pause dur="short"/> we want to help <pause dur="short"/> but also to learn from from their experiences of bouncing out of university trialling things finding things out</u>
<u n="306" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="307" who="S0261">changing paths and you can let that threat run through the whole lot of all this stuff <pause dur="short"/> you can say we wanna be connected with you for a year</u>
<u n="308" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="309" who="S0261">and find out where this goes</u>
<u n="310" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="311" who="S0261">and we want to trial we'll get in touch with you every two months and we'll get an update and we'll do a little blah-blah-blah and we can connect with you through you know we can provide you exposure to your site through ours</u>
<u n="312" who="S0262">mm mm</u>
<u n="313" who="S0261">et cetera and we'll get you to be a bit of a guest and you can write a little piece for us</u>
<u n="314" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="315" who="S0261">and that's what we want as well we want people who do producing stuff for us</u>
<u n="316" who="S0262">yeah so the so we've got some teasing elements to tease people into the community but the subscription to start off with with the model is to have a student base subscription and to show popularity that people are actually parting with their money to come into the community and get for example <pause dur="short"/> the whole the whole thing they get the whole shebang they get the whole case study they get the forum they get the content</u>
<u n="317" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah well <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> we can work out what</u>
<u n="318" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that is</u>
<u n="319" who="S0261" trans="overlap">that is yeah erm</u>
<u n="320" who="S0262" trans="overlap">well there'll have to be some reason for them to part with their money cos I mean what I've noticed is that there's a lot of people giving stuff out for free out there</u>
<u n="321" who="S0261">yeah well they're doing freemium you see so what they're doing is that they give you something to start with <pause dur="short"/> this is what I've kind of I haven't put it that way but it's what I've presented you've got a core marketing connected network</u>
<u n="322" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="323" who="S0261">and that on the side of that you've got this thing so the people come in here you give them back something for free and with that connection you you're teaching them about this which is you have to pay money to have a part of this</u>
<u n="324" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="325" who="S0261">and and it's gonna take time to to build that momentum but what you'll get is you will get a few er you know the the classic model of the people who are interested the the the newbies are will always go on there and then you've got the main crowd quite a bit later and the you know and then you've got the slow runners</u>
<u n="326" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0261" trans="overlap">later on</u>
<u n="328" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="329" who="S0261">so it's exactly that kind of model erm <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> we'll have to map out how all that might fit together and what products are involved and what products we need to create to start with</u>
<u n="330" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="331" who="S0261">and actually what time we really wanna get this thing to be connected so we're getting some money in the door</u>
<u n="332" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="333" who="S0261">now <pause dur="short"/> er what I would suggest is that this is why I'm kind of we want to try and start something off now to build the building blocks as a tester and to get some connections in because it will take six months at least to be getting some kind of awareness</u>
<u n="334" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0261">of this is what this is</u>
<u n="336" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="337" who="S0261">erm online and at that six month period you might then start to introduce the idea of if you've got this paid thing going on</u>
<u n="338" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0261">yeah? erm or it er might even be a longer period but <pause dur="short"/> on the other side of it you might go well in this case we would be focussing on something else that's bringing money in <pause dur="short"/> from this side of the things</u>
<u n="340" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="341" who="S0261">instead</u>
<u n="342" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="343" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0262">and then you have to figure who's what roles people are gonna play <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="345" who="S0261">you yeah you</u>
<u n="346" who="S0262" trans="overlap">er do we need just me or you? do we need a web developer? do we need a content creator?</u>
<u n="347" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="348" who="S0262">you know do we need a film person to edit stuff? you know what what's the list of resources we need?</u>
<u n="349" who="S0261"><trunc>abs</trunc> absolutely erm</u>
<u n="350" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and how much is that gonna cost to start up with?</u>
<u n="351" who="S0261">er exactly erm and <pause dur="short"/> we we need to present if if we are thinking just think we need to try and <trunc>r</trunc> raise some finance in some <trunc>m</trunc> some manner okay?</u>
<u n="352" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="353" who="S0261">so we need to run something effectively before we can do that</u>
<u n="354" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="355" who="S0261">we need we need to demonstrate that's er the idea works</u>
<u n="356" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="357" who="S0261">okay? er <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> you know I don't know how much money <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is investing in his thing but <pause dur="short"/> it's under ten thousand dollars</u>
<u n="358" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="359" who="S0261">it's somewhere between five and ten I think at the moment that is at a small level and he's trying his hardest to to to cut it down to the bare bones to see whether it has some kind of traction</u>
<u n="360" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="361" who="S0261">now you can argue well if you added that and added that you might get a bigger picture <pause dur="short"/> but he's like well I'm gonna try it at this scale <pause dur="short"/> if it works at this scale then I'll try the next bit and then the next bit <pause dur="short"/> and that takes time but what you've got is a sustainable foundation <pause dur="short"/> on which you've built something</u>
<u n="362" who="S0262">yeah I think we'll know when we're gonna start hitting the scalability because we'll have to work on <pause dur="short"/> social media quite a lot to get people coming into the platform and then wanting to part with their money and then showing that we've got those numbers</u>
<u n="363" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="364" who="S0262">and then we can start going and knocking on doors</u>
<u n="365" who="S0261">well the other part of it is is trying to find mechanisms to draw people in to do stuff erm you know on on a cheap and voluntary basis</u>
<u n="366" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="367" who="S0261">erm whether it's they are relative experts that you get guest bloggers to do stuff you people like the students you know to do a couple of free edits for for some videos</u>
<u n="368" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="369" who="S0261">erm that we actively outsource some stuff and maybe build a connection where we're getting stuff done for cheap cheap from somewhere</u>
<u n="370" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="371" who="S0261">erm and <pause dur="short"/> you know you can do a fiver to get some basic stuff done</u>
<u n="372" who="S0262">and also the legal stuff <pause dur="short"/> is who er who actually owns what</u>
<u n="373" who="S0261">yeah and there's a guy who's a part of the Location Rebel community who erm is he's a international lawyer bloke <pause dur="short"/> I don't know all I all I see is that he represents er er a range of people <pause dur="short"/> and people outside of the Location Rebel who I've had an awareness of otherwise who are wandering entrepreneurs <pause dur="short"/> erm so he must have some kind of <pause dur="short"/> ability <pause dur="short"/> erm whether he's the right kind of person to engage with or whether you get a certain better approach because or better deal because it's through Location Rebel I don't know <pause dur="short"/> you know maybe</u>
<u n="374" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="375" who="S0261">we'll start thinking <pause dur="short"/> and maybe <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> knows some people who would always who</u>
<u n="376" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="377" who="S0261">who have some kind of</u>
<u n="378" who="S0262">media</u>
<u n="379" who="S0261" trans="overlap">I get I get the first thing Australia's gotta be one of the most expensive places to actually get any of this stuff done</u>
<u n="380" who="S0262">which <trunc>c</trunc> which costs? though <trunc>an</trunc> everything?</u>
<u n="381" who="S0261">anything everything</u>
<u n="382" who="S0262" trans="overlap">just cos resources cost a lot of money</u>
<u n="383" who="S0261" trans="overlap">just bloody everything yeah</u>
<u n="384" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="385" who="S0261">so so</u>
<u n="386" who="S0262">but we have to demo it to start off with</u>
<u n="387" who="S0261">that's right <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="388" who="S0262" trans="overlap">you know we've gotta make sure that it we've gotta be confident that</u>
<u n="389" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="390" who="S0262">our ideas are gonna work</u>
<u n="391" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="392" who="S0262">and that then we can start thinking about well shifting it say offshore or something like that but we've gotta have the technology <pause dur="short"/> we've gotta have the professional you know looking thing and er we've gotta have ability to draw in people and fast</u>
<u n="393" who="S0261">well you've got your mate down the road who's who's er <trunc>t</trunc> who she's a developer isn't she?</u>
<u n="394" who="S0262">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm yes she is I mean as you know just</u>
<u n="395" who="S0261">but</u>
<u n="396" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="397" who="S0261" trans="overlap">to get that kind of context of how much does it cost to build one of these? you know and you could go and pick an example off the net and say how much do you reckon it cost them to do that?</u>
<u n="398" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="399" who="S0261">alright erm</u>
<u n="400" who="S0262">well I'm hoping that we can work with people we we form a good relationship with erm you know I know that they are probably go wanna go off and do their own things which suits me fine because <pause dur="short"/> they're gonna pursue their own careers say some of these students <pause dur="short"/> but at the same time they always need a bit of money</u>
<u n="401" who="S0261">yeah and they're getting some exposure et cetera et cetera</u>
<u n="402" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and as long as it's kind of going up their alley like you know</u>
<u n="403" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="404" who="S0262"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he likes a bit of film he likes a bit of web development he's obviously doing something else as well</u>
<u n="405" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="406" who="S0262">but to keep him kind of around and about and interested you know</u>
<u n="407" who="S0261" trans="overlap">what about <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>? or he's</u>
<u n="408" who="S0262" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s</u>
<u n="409" who="S0261" trans="overlap">thinking a different picture</u>
<u n="410" who="S0262"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s good at sort of talking to people <pause dur="short"/> he'd be probably with a bit more confidence he'd probably be quite a good salesperson but I don't see how he fits in at the moment apart from just talking it up</u>
<u n="411" who="S0261">or maybe his connections</u>
<u n="412" who="S0262">mm erm</u>
<u n="413" who="S0261">it's things like that you know</u>
<u n="414" who="S0262" trans="overlap">he's I'll tell you what he's good at he'd er he'd review it for you he'd evaluate it and be very</u>
<u n="415" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="416" who="S0262">honest</u>
<u n="417" who="S0261">yeah okay</u>
<u n="418" who="S0262">constructive</u>
<u n="419" who="S0261">alright well we <trunc>ne</trunc> you obviously need somebody who's like that</u>
<u n="420" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="421" who="S0261">and kicks you in the butt</u>
<u n="422" who="S0262">mm he's good at reviewing things</u>
<u n="423" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and throws in a bit of a a wobbler at you every now and again</u>
<u n="424" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="425" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="426" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="427" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="428" who="S0262">he's good like that and then erm <pause dur="short"/> well actually the law student <vocal desc="laugh"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she might know something about copyright and IPR and all that sort of thing so</u>
<u n="429" who="S0261">yeah it's kind of a case of at what stage <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="430" who="S0262">she's</u>
<u n="431" who="S0261" trans="overlap">you get all that stuff sorted</u>
<u n="432" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah but she's worth asking she's just that she'll just sort of say well do do you work with people or a company?</u>
<u n="433" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="434" who="S0262">I mean this is another thing where you you're using their personal learning network</u>
<u n="435" who="S0261">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="436" who="S0262" trans="overlap">to find out stuff that you need to know yourself</u>
<u n="437" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="438" who="S0262" trans="overlap">at no cost</u>
<u n="439" who="S0261">absolutely</u>
<u n="440" who="S0262" trans="overlap">to start with</u>
<u n="441" who="S0261">uh-huh</u>
<u n="442" who="S0262">and then you reach erm at the end of the no cost and you have to then pay for it</u>
<u n="443" who="S0261">and presumably there are some kind of cheap bizzo type stuff that you can get your nose into</u>
<u n="444" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="445" who="S0261">yeah yeah you know erm that all comes down to detail but I think first we I think what we said the other day was cos tomorrow's Tuesday morning are we gonna do anything beyond what we've just done?</u>
<u n="446" who="S0262">no I don't think so</u>
<u n="447" who="S0261" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="448" who="S0262">I think we've gotta we've gotta now just get a feasibility plan together</u>
<u n="449" who="S0261">so I think we'll have a look at what we've got in front of us</u>
<u n="450" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="451" who="S0261">let's see if anything else pops up and er get some kind of map-out down</u>
<u n="452" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="453" who="S0261">erm</u>
<u n="454" who="S0262">get some people signed up for this thing</u>
<u n="455" who="S0261">and yeah it's it's the marketing type stuff as well to not marketing it's market research erm <pause dur="short"/> frankly I'm not very convinced with the name <pause dur="short"/> erm and I think that there are some a lot cleverer names that we could come up with</u>
<u n="456" who="S0262">alright</u>
<u n="457" who="S0261">one that <trunc>ki</trunc> crossed my mind was something called the helper <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="458" who="S0262">it makes me think of mother's little helper</u>
<u n="459" who="S0261">yeah but it's just an example of <pause dur="short"/> so it's somebody somebody's trying to sell a domain anyway but <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="460" who="S0262">well we'll talk about that another time</u>
<u n="461" who="S0261" trans="overlap">that kind that kind of thing</u>
<u n="462" who="S0262" trans="overlap">I'm too tired to think about it</u>
<u n="463" who="S0261">a brainstorm of <pause dur="short"/> look at you look at all the the the the types of websites that are actually in people's consciousness now all have a very well-crafted clever brand branded name</u>
<u n="464" who="S0262">well I'm sure they do but I thought about that in on Sunday morning and basically</u>
<u n="465" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah I know I know it just</u>
<u n="466" who="S0262" trans="overlap">we just bought it</u>
<u n="467" who="S0261">yeah</u>

<u n="469" who="S0261">yeah I don't wanna</u>
<u n="470" who="S0262" trans="overlap">cos it's need to have a name</u>

<u n="472" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="473" who="S0261" trans="overlap">because <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> once you start with it it's an it's an arse to change</u>
<u n="474" who="S0262"><trunc>alrigh</trunc> well we'll sleep on that I'll see how I feel about that I'm not convinced yet but we're just gonna change it but yeah alright I'll see</u>

<u n="476" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="477" who="S0261">erm</u>
<u n="478" who="S0262">I think you've gotta test it amongst the age group I don't think you and I could make a decision alone on a name until</u>
<u n="479" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="480" who="S0262">you've actually really tested it out there I don't think that's fair to the people that potentially might quite like it</u>
<u n="481" who="S0261">what would be more rather than Port of Cool Port of Call is isn't such a bad idea</u>
<u n="482" who="S0262">yeah alright <vocal desc="laugh"/> now I'm gonna go to sleep</u>
<u n="483" who="S0261">eh?</u>
