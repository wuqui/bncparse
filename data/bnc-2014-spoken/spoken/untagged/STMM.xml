<u n="5" who="S0529" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it wouldn't be that simple <pause dur="short"/> cos I know it wouldn't cos that's what happened last year <pause dur="short"/> no I've had that experience and <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I think <trunc>no</trunc> I might feel differently if I left here because I feel like if I left here it would be <pause dur="short"/> under my own circumstances and I'd feel a bit more like in control of it</u>
<u n="6" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="7" who="S0529">cos last year I wasn't in my in my right mind to make that decision <pause dur="short"/> I just did it <pause dur="short"/> as like a kind of</u>

<u n="16" who="S0530">mm</u>
<u n="17" who="S0529">relive <pause dur="short"/> and I felt like going back to <anon type="place"/> would just be like <pause dur="short"/> like kind of <pause dur="short"/> tempting</u>
<u n="18" who="S0530">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0529" trans="overlap">like another <pause dur="short"/> sort of similar experience to happen and I always felt <trunc>s</trunc> like <pause dur="short"/> that I didn't really get on with the people in my flat and I was worried that I wouldn't get <pause dur="short"/> accommodation again because in the <trunc>s</trunc> in the second year like <pause dur="short"/> no cos I I'd still be in first year but I wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> qualify for accommodation <pause dur="short"/> on campus so I would have to like</u>
