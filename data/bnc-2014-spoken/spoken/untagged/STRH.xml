<u n="16" who="S0037" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I like that sort of yellowy bananary canary colour</u>
<u n="17" who="S0115">yeah well I think that some of the kits that they have um could be more  could be more  extravagant I suppose um</u>
<u n="18" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0115">but they must think that it's uh that it's off-putting to have really bright bits or</u>
<u n="20" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah like <trunc>highla</trunc> <trunc>pe</trunc> highlighter pen colours?</u>
<u n="21" who="S0115">or it's not you know it's not masculine enough to have um pink kits so I don't  I don't  know any teams that have a pink kit</u>
<u n="22" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I'm <trunc>su</trunc> I'm sure someone's <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure someone's got like a purpley pink <pause dur="short"/> did Arsenal not have like a sort of how would you call it? Like a magenta sort of coloured one for a while?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0115">um I don't know</u>
<u n="24" who="S0037">maybe it wasn't them</u>

<u n="29" who="S0115">um</u>
<u n="30" who="S0037">also I think like there's a lot of stripes on the go <pause dur="short"/> I I I'm fancying a few polka dots</u>
<u n="31" who="S0115">yeah they don't have they don't really have spotty ones but but I think that would be it like sort of distracting with the  with the  ball wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="32" who="S0037" trans="overlap">you know like jockeys have <pause dur="short"/> or like some chevrons?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0115">uh <trunc>y</trunc> yeah that <unclear/> that's probably a bit distracting as well innit?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0037">or like um</u>
<u n="35" who="S0115" trans="overlap">animal patterns or <trunc>fla</trunc> flame patterns like</u>
<u n="36" who="S0037" trans="overlap">animal animal patterns <pause dur="short"/> that'd be good wouldn't it? Like a leopard print?</u>

<u n="38" who="S0037" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Like a zebra</u>
<u n="39" who="S0115">well yeah cos <trunc>i</trunc> if they had names like the you know like the the Tigers or something then they could actually look like tigers and then that would be</u>
<u n="40" who="S0037">oh yeah that's a good idea</u>
<u n="41" who="S0115">uh</u>
<u n="42" who="S0037">like rugby league does that though don't they?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0115" trans="overlap">so could be like like the Cowboys and and the Indians or something and <pause dur="short"/> actually look like that that would be uh</u>
<u n="44" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I saw like</u>
<u n="45" who="S0115" trans="overlap">like the <trunc>Vi</trunc> the <trunc>V</trunc> the Vipers or something? Uh</u>
<u n="46" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well I saw like you know  you know  I've been knitting stuff and that at the minute</u>
<u n="47" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0037">for uh the baby <pause dur="short"/> well I saw this pattern like I like sort of unusual patterns <pause dur="short"/> and I saw this one and it was like for a tuxedo but it wasn't it was just a knitted jumper</u>
<u n="49" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but it looked like a baby tuxedo <vocal desc="laugh"/> like a dickie-bow tie and like a white shirt with like buttons and like a cumberbund and then like a jacket?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0115" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Right yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="52" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but it was just a jumper <pause dur="short"/> so I could do that <pause dur="short"/> could have them in like dinner you know dinner suits</u>
<u n="53" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well people <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> you know people dress sort of babies in that sort of thing nowadays don't they so?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I'm not sure if they dress them in knitted dinner jackets mind but uh <vocal desc="laugh"/> that's probably a bit of a niche audience <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="55" who="S0115">uh <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but they dress them as like big pumpkins and stuff don't they? On Halloween</u>
<u n="57" who="S0115">I can see how uh you know you might wanna <trunc>y</trunc> you could make anything out of knitting I suppose and <trunc>i</trunc> for clothes like you could imitate things couldn't you?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0115">you could sort of imitate like like a football kit I suppose you could knit a football  a football  shirt and</u>
<u n="60" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah you could <pause dur="short"/> that'd be nice and warm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0115">uh or</u>
<u n="62" who="S0037" trans="overlap">you could do <pause dur="short"/> little military one</u>
<u n="63" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I'm not <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if I've seen that <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if there is a market for knitted uh sportswear but uh</u>

<u n="65" who="S0115"><trunc>Kn</trunc> knitted um</u>
<u n="66" who="S0037">Cos they're all that horrible sort of nylon aren't they? Is it nylon</u>
<u n="67" who="S0115" trans="overlap">for for babies that have grown up supporting Everton or something and they would have like Everton woolly jumper or something</u>
<u n="68" who="S0037" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Well I could definitely knit a red and white stripy one <pause dur="short"/> that'd be quite nice to make</u>
<u n="69" who="S0115" trans="overlap">uh for for uh Southampton or</u>
<u n="70" who="S0037">not Southampton <pause dur="short"/> you know what for</u>
<u n="71" who="S0115" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="72" who="S0037"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="73" who="S0115" trans="overlap">and uh</u>
<u n="74" who="S0037">uh</u>
<u n="75" who="S0115">I mean yeah the colours could be  could be  more extravagant</u>

<u n="77" who="S0115">uh</u>
<u n="78" who="S0037" trans="overlap">like where they have like a <trunc>s</trunc> like hoops and</u>

<u n="80" who="S0037" trans="overlap">and like you know like even rugby does like even rugby has the that kind of <pause dur="short"/> the Harlequin thing <pause dur="short"/> and like the um hoops and stuff don't they?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0115" trans="overlap">or like the Harlequins that they I like  I like  their one that's got sort of four bits <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="88" who="S0037">nothing wrong with red and white <pause dur="short"/> I think that's about the like the limit of my football knowledge though I just <pause dur="short"/> I like watching it but <pause dur="short"/> I think it that's because I like watching anything like I could happily get consumed by the darts or the snooker</u>
<u n="89" who="S0115">yeah well sport is good to watch uh especially in the pub and uh</u>
<u n="90" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="95" who="S0115">when the</u>
<u n="96" who="S0037">are you looking forward to the Olympics?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0115">um <pause dur="short"/> uh <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean I don't normally watch loads of of Olympics but um because it is in London this time I suppose uh suppose I should get more involved into it so it's</u>
<u n="98" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
