<u n="69" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0041">while I'm still excited about it <pause dur="short"/> ah so I did all the tests</u>
<u n="71" who="S0084" trans="overlap">customizing <pause dur="short"/> yeah how did you get on?</u>
<u n="72" who="S0041">I worked it all out and I'm averaging eighty percent</u>
<u n="73" who="S0084">oh wow there you go</u>
<u n="74" who="S0041" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> uh the ones I didn't know they say just guess anyway <pause dur="short"/> if you're in that time I'm spending that time on maths</u>
<u n="75" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0041">I didn't guess any <pause dur="short"/> so I couldn't potentially get another percent or something <pause dur="short"/> just by lucky guessing</u>
<u n="77" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="78" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> but what I didn't know how to do like I don't know how to do division long division when it's two numbers <pause dur="short"/> into <pause dur="short"/> You know when you do the little sign?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0084" trans="overlap">oh fucking hell yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0041" trans="overlap">if it's <trunc>t</trunc> if it's two numbers getting divided? Cos I'm alright <trunc>eigh</trunc> eight and then divide through three thousand two hundred and seventy-one <pause dur="short"/> fine <pause dur="short"/> but if it's like thirty-eight and then in the thing three thousand I can't do that</u>
<u n="81" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0041">my brain just says no</u>
<u n="83" who="S0084">yeah well I think you have to do it separately don't you don't you have to break it down?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0041">do you?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0084">it takes <trunc>age</trunc> yeah like you're like the sum is like that</u>
<u n="86" who="S0041">oh yes oh <trunc>n</trunc> I haven't worked doing this I couldn't do it</u>
<u n="87" who="S0084" trans="overlap">you <trunc>ne</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> no don't do it <pause dur="short"/> just don't do it to yourself <pause dur="short"/> just just miss that out</u>
<u n="88" who="S0041">yeah I think there's there's three questions three marks lost and that's gonna have to do</u>
<u n="89" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0041">but one of them there's a lot of times and decimals</u>
<u n="91" who="S0084">oh shit</u>
<u n="92" who="S0041">how the hell d'you do that?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0084">uh <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> uh</u>
<u n="94" who="S0041" trans="overlap">Cos I tried to do it like you like you would do a normal times</u>
<u n="95" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0041">that</u>
<u n="97" who="S0084">that's wrong</u>
<u n="98" who="S0041">that's wrong <pause dur="short"/> cos whatever I got was miles over the five options</u>
<u n="99" who="S0084" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> uh you've gotta remember to move the decimal point haven't you that's the thing?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0041">move the decimal point?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos obviously it's tens hundreds and thousands isn't it like depending on where the decimal point is?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="103" who="S0084">so like if it's something something decimal point something that's tens <pause dur="short"/> but then after the decimal point it's tens hundreds and thousands as well <pause dur="short"/> so if you're <trunc>w</trunc> if it's like thirty-two point forty-five <pause dur="short"/> and it's timesed by four</u>
<u n="104" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0084">then you have to move it one</u>
<u n="106" who="S0041">yeah no I can do that <pause dur="short"/> but what 'bout three point two times six point nine</u>
<u n="107" who="S0084">Don't know</u>
<u n="108" who="S0041">no I don't know either <pause dur="short"/> gonna have to learn though</u>
<u n="109" who="S0084">yeah no I dunno <pause dur="short"/> well just Google that</u>

<u n="118" who="S0041">eighty percent isn't bad <pause dur="short"/> I mean</u>
<u n="119" who="S0084" trans="overlap">eighty percent's really good <pause dur="short"/> like as a starting point that's good</u>
<u n="120" who="S0041" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's close to the mark though isn't it if you need</u>
<u n="121" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah but that</u>
