<u n="1" who="S0325">all the physics teachers are like <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah physics it's really easy when you've got the maths side of it and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s like a maths genius and she was like I did the mock and it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life <vocal desc="laugh"/> and only like ten people in their class got a C and the rest of them failed <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="150" who="S0325" trans="overlap">Mr <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s not a very good actual teacher because he's a musician and musicians are always like <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>sh</trunc> he knows what he's doing</u>
<u n="151" who="S0324">yeah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0325">and he expects everyone else to know what he's doing but <trunc>kn</trunc> what they're doing but no one knows what they're doing and they're like what's happening? I don't really understand <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="153" who="S0324" trans="overlap">yeah yeah so he just like <pause dur="short"/> expects you to understand <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="154" who="S0325" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> but he thinks everyone that does music is automatically like already is already like really clever and so we turn up to theory he's like are you getting this? are you getting you're getting this</u>
<u n="155" who="S0324" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0325">okay er he won't even ask he'll be like right <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you're getting this you're getting this I'm like I'm not getting it</u>
<u n="157" who="S0324"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="159" who="S0324"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0325">because you picked it up really quickly when we didn't do any of our homework and I'm still there like hold on a minute wait what's a cadence? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="161" who="S0324"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah but then I've kind of feel sorry for everyone that hasn't done grade five theory today having to</u>
<u n="162" who="S0325" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="163" who="S0324">like having to try and understand him going right this is one this is</u>

<u n="169" who="S0324">this is how you do a <trunc>ca</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> no he <trunc>di</trunc> it's not even this is how you do a cadence it's just</u>
<u n="170" who="S0325"><vocal desc="laugh"/> this is a <trunc>cade</trunc></u>
<u n="171" who="S0324" trans="overlap">chord five to one is a perfect cadence</u>
<u n="172" who="S0325" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="173" who="S0324">chord four to one is an imperfect cadence</u>
<u n="174" who="S0325"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0324" trans="overlap">this sounds like a full stop this sounds like a comma</u>
