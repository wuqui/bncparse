<u n="87" who="S0202" trans="overlap">no I do believe that but it's so shit watching it</u>
<u n="88" who="S0203" trans="overlap"><unclear/> to the point where you would <unclear/> some players on here were like <unclear/> you can't just stick a team of eleven people that have all got a high work rate you've got to have some that have got a low <unclear/> they are they can't just teach eleven players that are all gonna be like running about everywhere and that means everyone'll be out of position when I found that out last night I was like what? like it's blown my mind <unclear/></u>

<u n="94" who="S0203" trans="overlap">yeah they're not a team they're all running about everywhere yeah you wanna pick two or three players that are like that you wanna pick two or three players that just stay where they are all the time <unclear/> players</u>
<u n="95" who="S0202">like defenders</u>
<u n="96" who="S0203">yeah but it's all so tactical so much goes into it you think they're all <unclear/> all these players are so much</u>

<u n="98" who="S0203"><unclear/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0202">I understand that so much thought goes into any kind of skill and <unclear/> go into it but what I don't understand is why so many millions of people love it</u>

<u n="456" who="S0203">for a for a job I could yeah for a relationship I couldn't if I wasn't happy I wouldn't be in it but for a job I would I would if I was just ticking along and it was making me a wage I could do whatever I wanted in my spare time and have a <trunc>lo</trunc>lovely wife and all that and just chill out and just you know</u>
<u n="457" who="S0202" trans="overlap">earn enough money</u>

<u n="464" who="S0203">yeah</u>
<u n="465" who="S0202">that's why I hated Mcdonald's because I was so much better than a fucking staff <trunc>memb</trunc> er like just a crew member and I'm not being big headed but</u>

<u n="471" who="S0202" trans="overlap">it was it is I know but why? like it's so sad</u>
<u n="472" who="S0203" trans="overlap">but but you know why I like <trunc>Mcdo</trunc> do you know why I like Mcdonald's though? it's because it offers people who don't who aren't clever at all</u>
<u n="473" who="S0202">progress</u>
<u n="474" who="S0203">it offers them a chance to be</u>
<u n="475" who="S0202">better</u>
<u n="476" who="S0203">yeah it cos some people'll leave school with no qualifications at all go to Mcdonald's and be summat and have a wage otherwise they wouldn't be anything would they? so for that sort of thing I can appreciate what it is and for people like me and you we're never gonna fucking stay there for the rest of our lives</u>
<u n="477" who="S0202">no</u>
<u n="478" who="S0203">it's so cold</u>

<u n="484" who="S0203">look what you've done</u>
<u n="485" who="S0202">like do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="486" who="S0203" trans="overlap">a lot of people go through their entire lives doing nothing that you've already done</u>
<u n="487" who="S0202">but that that's what makes it sad for these people these people who don't have any ambition I feel so sad for them</u>
<u n="488" who="S0203">but if they're happy with it I don't begrudge them that at all if if I've got</u>
<u n="489" who="S0202" trans="overlap">no I don't but I feel bad for them it's like they don't have the intelligence to want more if that makes sense?</u>
<u n="490" who="S0203">I <trunc>kind</trunc>I kinda do but if they're happy with themselves I can't say I can't say like ah you should be <trunc>asp</trunc> er aspiring to more because like if they're happy with it if I was happy yeah I would I if I was happy with <unclear/></u>
<u n="491" who="S0202">no but I still feel sorry for them</u>
<u n="492" who="S0203">yeah but if I was happy working at Mcdonald's I would do it but I wasn't like you <trunc>c</trunc>you could never say <unclear>that</unclear> but but if it meant if I was working there like two days a week and I was earning a really good wage and had the rest of the day <unclear/> the rest of the week I could do whatever I wanted I would</u>
<u n="493" who="S0202">yeah me too I would like my dream is to work erm three <trunc>day</trunc>three days a week and have the rest of it off that is my dream and then in your that I can have a nice life not I don't wanna be I don't wanna be a millionaire I don't wanna be rich and I don't wanna be famous</u>
<u n="494" who="S0203" trans="overlap">I just <unclear>wanna</unclear> support myself that's it</u>
<u n="495" who="S0202">I just wanna be able to do what I want to do and have money in the bank that's it</u>
<u n="496" who="S0203">and go on maybe having a holiday a <trunc>yea</trunc> er once a year or whatever</u>
<u n="497" who="S0202">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="498" who="S0203">go to America <unclear/></u>
<u n="499" who="S0202">maybe maybe</u>
<u n="500" who="S0203"><unclear>go and</unclear> live the dream</u>
<u n="501" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/> the American dream <pause dur="short"/> but I'm I'm I know it sounds bad my sister got erm pregnant eighteen months ago and my heart broke I cried my eyes out and I was devastated for her because I just thought do you know what?</u>
<u n="502" who="S0203" trans="overlap"><unclear>but she</unclear></u>
<u n="503" who="S0202">you've never been no listen you've never been abroad you've never done all this and then I sat down and thought about it and I thought you know what? she might not want the same things that I want</u>
<u n="504" who="S0203"><unclear>this is it</unclear></u>
<u n="505" who="S0202">and her aspirations in life are different to mine so maybe me feeling sorry for her is not what she wants because she's happy how she is</u>
<u n="506" who="S0203">is she?</u>
<u n="507" who="S0202">I don't know</u>
<u n="508" who="S0203">how old is she?</u>
<u n="509" who="S0202">twenty</u>
<u n="510" who="S0203">maybe maybe in a couple of years she'll realise that she might not want to do that like your but chances are when you've got a kid as well it changes your whole like <vocal desc="cough"/> <unclear>reasoning</unclear> <unclear/> whatever cos I've got a mate who's twenty-one I go round to her house sometimes and she's and she's like I wish I had a a a I'd've had a job and all that but then <unclear/> is like the best thing that's ever happened to her it sorted her out it settled her down she's become a proper woman</u>
<u n="511" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="512" who="S0203">so that was all that she was ever gonna do she did it and she now she's happy for it</u>
<u n="513" who="S0202">happy yeah</u>
<u n="514" who="S0203">so</u>
<u n="515" who="S0202">see my sister had a job she had a life she met a knobhead from a rebound got pregnant to him after they'd been together five years and then they've been together ever since and she isn't happy with him but she loves the child which you always will do</u>
<u n="516" who="S0203">and that's worth it yeah</u>
<u n="517" who="S0202">but like you know when you look at someone and you just think I never want that and you automatically feel sorry for them because of your own aspirations? that's what I look at her and think and when I found out she were pregnant I cried my eyes out I my heart broke because my parents had never taken us abroad they could never afford it and I just thought you've never been abroad you've never experienced a holiday with friends you've never been travelling you've never seen all these things and I just think to myself well maybe she didn't want that</u>
<u n="518" who="S0203">mm</u>
<u n="519" who="S0202">maybe I'm looking at her life how I would want mine and not how she wants it and it it makes me feel bad but I I I feel so devastated for her because like when I went to America she said to me she's like oh you're not gonna be back in time for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s first birthday and I'm like well <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s not gonna remember me not being there</u>
<u n="520" who="S0203">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="521" who="S0202">like you're the only person that's gonna remember it even if you do remember it in twenty years time like it doesn't matter he won't remember it I'll see him after and I just and every time I speak to her she talks about decorating she decorated the living room or she's done this she's done that and I just think it's so fucking boring</u>
<u n="522" who="S0203">yeah</u>
<u n="523" who="S0202">but that's me that's</u>
<u n="524" who="S0203" trans="overlap">that that's her life though that's what <trunc>sh</trunc>she loves like</u>
<u n="525" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="526" who="S0203">that's her passion so you've gotta respect it to a certain point like</u>
<u n="527" who="S0202">I do respect it but I still feel bad</u>
<u n="528" who="S0203">I couldn't do it myself and neither could you but</u>
<u n="529" who="S0202">but that's what makes us special <unclear/> person there's not many people who have the same ambition is there? like a lot of people amble through life and that's it</u>
<u n="530" who="S0203"><unclear>I need to go for a piss</unclear></u>
<u n="531" who="S0202">you need to go inside as well? fucking freezing <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm I'm gonna get another bottle of wine is that alright?</u>
