<u n="66" who="S0203">I could have cried I could have cried</u>
<u n="67" who="S0202" trans="overlap">I know that's really sad</u>
<u n="68" who="S0203">Robin Williams was a big part of my life</u>
<u n="69" who="S0202">he was me</u>
<u n="70" who="S0203" trans="overlap">I used to love improvisational comedy and he was like so sick at it I used to watch him <unclear/></u>
<u n="71" who="S0202">he was the master of it he created it</u>
<u n="72" who="S0203">er so when he died I was like christ that's like a huge part of what I used to watch and what I used to love</u>
<u n="73" who="S0202">it were a massive part of my childhood like</u>
<u n="74" who="S0203">it made me feel really bad but erm I reckon that's gonna be happening quite a lot more often now I reckon a lot of other people that we used to love will start dying</u>
<u n="75" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0203">like my my favourite er guitarist when I was like sixteen was Eric Clapton but he's like seventy odd now he's gonna die</u>
<u n="77" who="S0202">he's gonna die soon in the next ten or twenty years</u>
<u n="78" who="S0203">cos he used to abuse drugs so much then that they're all gonna be a lot iller than they should do <pause dur="short"/> so I reckon people like that are gonna start dying soon and that's gonna be gutting for me Paul McCartney</u>
<u n="79" who="S0202">oh I love Paul McCartney I love The Beatles <pause dur="short"/> like <pause dur="short"/> there's two people in my whole life that I know that love The Beatles as much as I do my dad and one of my friends er we're not really friends any more but cos we've grown apart</u>
<u n="80" who="S0203" trans="overlap">and now and now me</u>
<u n="81" who="S0202">and now you like The Beatles to me like do you know when <pause dur="short"/>  like I loved The Spice Girls when I was growing up cos I was a teenage girl blah blah blah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0203">can I tell you <unclear>I still do</unclear></u>
<u n="83" who="S0202">me too</u>
<u n="84" who="S0203">I I've have got The Best of The Spice Girls on</u>
<u n="85" who="S0202">I've got all their albums I've got all the well I don't have the album I have their albums now but I used to have the cassettes</u>
<u n="86" who="S0203">yeah</u>
<u n="87" who="S0202">and like</u>
<u n="88" who="S0203">that that dates you cos I had the CD <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="89" who="S0202">yeah I had the cassettes <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="90" who="S0203" trans="overlap">you had the cassettes <unclear/> just a bit older than me</u>
<u n="91" who="S0202">two years difference <pause dur="short"/> but like I just I just look back now and I think music back in the day inverted commas whatever like used to when you were younger your whole life revolved around music sort of thing you were <pause dur="short"/> if you if you were a goth you listened to like</u>
<u n="92" who="S0203" trans="overlap">that's what you look like innit</u>
<u n="93" who="S0202">Sabbath that what you look like blah blah blah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0203">it takes on your whole persona don't it?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0202">yeah your whole</u>
<u n="96" who="S0203" trans="overlap"><unclear/> cos I live around music music people say it but music is my life like you my career music's what I do for fun music's what I do when I'm bored you know everything I</u>
<u n="97" who="S0202" trans="overlap">your degree</u>
<u n="98" who="S0203">everything I do is revolving around music so it is my life so if I if erm people die like Eric Clapton or something it really affects me and if</u>
<u n="99" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0203">and obviously it affects people er who were I don't like to say but <unclear>normal</unclear> like non <unclear/> non-musicians</u>
<u n="101" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah I know what you mean non-musicians yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0203">but it affects me just a tiny bit more and it's gonna <unclear/> them at some point</u>
<u n="103" who="S0202">cos your creativity comes from that</u>
<u n="104" who="S0203">yeah other and I I find it hard to identify because I'm not artistic I can't I can write stories but I'm a bit of a writer but I'm not like creative in many other ways so it all comes out when <unclear>you</unclear> do a song so my my granddad he's creative through dance yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> so what he does he just</u>
<u n="105" who="S0202" trans="overlap">right your granddad?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0203">my granddad</u>
<u n="107" who="S0202">how old is he?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0203">like sixty odd</u>
<u n="109" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="110" who="S0203">he's <unclear/> <pause dur="long"/> so er I respect that but like when people do say like oh well music is my life or whatever I kind of go it's not your life it's not your life</u>
<u n="111" who="S0202" trans="overlap">is it though? is it though?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0203">even to me I could still survive without music</u>
<u n="113" who="S0202">no I couldn't</u>
<u n="114" who="S0203">I'd find summut to do even though</u>
<u n="115" who="S0202" trans="overlap">I couldn't I'd rather be blind than deaf</u>
<u n="116" who="S0203">really?</u>
<u n="117" who="S0202">yeah cos like</u>
<u n="118" who="S0203">I think I think I would agree with that because I'm nearly blind today</u>
<u n="119" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah me too</u>
<u n="120" who="S0203"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0202">but like I don't know actually though because if I'm given a choice to be born blind or to be born deaf I would choose I would be born deaf like because I wouldn't know about music I wouldn't know what it sounded like but</u>
<u n="122" who="S0203" trans="overlap">I don't think you'd miss it though because like okay well you're Stevie Wonder who's a brilliant musician who were born blind</u>
<u n="123" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="124" who="S0203">will he have ever missed being able to see because he never he never had any concept of actually what</u>
<u n="125" who="S0202">you wouldn't miss it cos you've never had it</u>
<u n="126" who="S0203"><unclear/> you don't know what seeing is so how could you ever people describe it to you how do you describe <unclear/> like when people say oh it's really colourful or whatever you know what's the colour? you don't know</u>
<u n="127" who="S0202">feel like one of my <trunc>frie</trunc> my best friends is deaf</u>
<u n="128" who="S0203">right</u>
<u n="129" who="S0202">and when we're out at nightclubs and stuff and she dances and stuff like that like she doesn't actually know what it sounds like she can like she's not she is profoundly deaf but</u>
<u n="130" who="S0203">she gets the vibrations like yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0202" trans="overlap">vibrations so she can sort of tell a tune but like personally like I know what things look like so say like I turn sixty and someone gave me a choice you can either be deaf or you can be blind well I already know what colours are I already know what people look like okay</u>
<u n="132" who="S0203">you could you could deal with it a bit more</u>
<u n="133" who="S0202">you could deal with it more but if you think that you'll have never you'll never hear music again you'll never hear people you love speak</u>
<u n="134" who="S0203">yeah for me</u>
<u n="135" who="S0202">but then seeing them</u>
<u n="136" who="S0203" trans="overlap">for me for me it'd be hard cos obviously I love music so much but I don't know I I do like seeing <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="137" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0203">even though even though without <unclear/> I'm pretty much blind</u>
<u n="139" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="140" who="S0203">like I still do love</u>
<u n="141" who="S0202">but that's the thing can you could you cope with being deaf and blind?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0203">no no I've always said if I lost a couple of limbs like say if I lost my legs or if I lost my arms or something</u>
<u n="143" who="S0202">I'd want to die</u>
<u n="144" who="S0203">I yeah I'd would I wouldn't be able to do it</u>
<u n="145" who="S0202">I could not think of anything worse than being paralysed</u>
<u n="146" who="S0203">I'm not strong enough to be able to <unclear>survive</unclear> that sort of thing like</u>
<u n="147" who="S0202">no me either</u>
<u n="148" who="S0203">I'd give up</u>
<u n="149" who="S0202">like I could not my my worst nightmare is probably being paralysed like being</u>
<u n="150" who="S0203" trans="overlap">well the worst ones are when they're paralysed but</u>
<u n="151" who="S0202" trans="overlap">trapped in your own body and you can't say or speak or</u>
<u n="152" who="S0203" trans="overlap">yeah but if they got me in one of them computers where my eyes could point at it and like make a like a you know make a <unclear/> kill me now kill me now with like</u>
<u n="153" who="S0202"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah like my mum used to work for Age Concern and erm she had a few patients who were erm trapped in their own bodies so to speak so they were completely paralysed and the only way they could <trunc>commun</trunc>communicate was their eyes and she'd say if that that ever happens to me just kill me because</u>
<u n="154" who="S0203">the the thing is when you do something like that in this country I don't know I mean it's not legal to do that but then you have to go to prison for doing that to someone that you love which is wrong if they</u>
<u n="155" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0203">it should be an incredibly thorough procedure and then right at the end of it you should be able to like kill someone that you love or whatever but it would have to be the most strictest procedure ever like you'd have to go through do they wanna do it? they'll have to find this this and this they'll have to</u>
<u n="157" who="S0202">but if they're paralysed they can't sign it</u>
<u n="158" who="S0203">I know but that that's the thing is like but you couldn't do it any other way because if they didn't have all that you could just go round killing your relatives for you know your inheritance or whatever so you've got that side of it and then there's that thing of erm you could do it abroad in Sweden they <unclear/></u>
<u n="159" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah but then you come back home and you get prosecuted for it</u>
<u n="160" who="S0203">so</u>
<u n="161" who="S0202">I think me me personally when I get to like a certain age like forty or fifty I am going to write a will and I'm going to have a will saying if I get these diseases or I can't do this then I want you to take me to Switzerland and wherever</u>
<u n="162" who="S0203">yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0202">but there's gonna be a clause in my will or contract or whatever that will say you can tell anyone what you're doing</u>
<u n="164" who="S0203">right</u>
<u n="165" who="S0202">and you can't blame yourself sort of thing</u>
<u n="166" who="S0203">it just always is</u>
<u n="167" who="S0202" trans="overlap">because</u>
<u n="168" who="S0203">got a nice family trip to Switzerland with your paralysed relative they go <unclear/> do like <unclear/></u>
<u n="169" who="S0202" trans="overlap">and they die naturally yeah but I can't think of anything worse than being trapped</u>
<u n="170" who="S0203"><unclear/></u>
<u n="171" who="S0202">what?</u>
<u n="172" who="S0203"><unclear/> going out and he did get really drunk so</u>
<u n="173" who="S0202">yeah should go out <vocal desc="cough"/> okay I've got two options for you <pause dur="short"/> two that's it that's it we can <trunc>spec</trunc> we can drink the rest of this go to my house have Bacardi JD <unclear/> loads of mixers</u>
<u n="174" who="S0203">a party now <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0202"><unclear/> though cos I don't think anyone</u>
<u n="176" who="S0203" trans="overlap">yeah?</u>
<u n="177" who="S0202">do you know anyone who would come?</u>
<u n="178" who="S0203">I've got <vocal desc="laugh"/> I've got mates that would come but not that would want to come <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="179" who="S0202">oh okay me too and we can do that and go out and around town after when we're hammered</u>
<u n="180" who="S0203">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0202">and no one gives a shit or we could stay here drink more and then go out after but the thing is we're gonna spend shit loads of fucking money</u>
<u n="182" who="S0203">yeah</u>
<u n="183" who="S0202">which I don't have and you probably don't have</u>
<u n="184" who="S0203">yeah whatever whatever</u>
