<u n="1229" who="S0558">it sounds to me like <pause dur="short"/> they potentially have had a watch returned in the past but I mean how do you know that is a brand new watch and it's not one that they've had a problem with I E this problem</u>

<u n="1237" who="S0558">mm</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0517">and then we'd have to go to the small claims court and go down that route what a hassle I just said to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I don't you know it's too much hassle</u>
