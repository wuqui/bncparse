<u n="71" who="S0084">treating my friends in that way</u>
<u n="72" who="S0041">do you know the worst thing is? When we were together before er before we decided to separate</u>
<u n="73" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="74" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> I did say to him why are you neglecting your friendships so much?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0041">and I <trunc>ha</trunc> I had said it to him before in the relationship <pause dur="short"/> and I used to maintain his friendships for him</u>
<u n="77" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0041">you know <pause dur="short"/> I used to invite Tom to things we were doing <pause dur="short"/> for his twenty-second I I took him back up to <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> cos I though oh he's away from his friends</u>
<u n="79" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0041">I took him back up to <anon type="place"/> to a gig and surprised him <pause dur="short"/> I arranged all his friends to be there</u>
<u n="81" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's nice</u>
<u n="82" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> to do that for him <pause dur="short"/> and now cos obviously Gemma doesn't know him very well</u>
<u n="83" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0041">she you know she'll not think to do that</u>
<u n="85" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's early days isn't it?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and we've crossed this bridge before <pause dur="short"/> and I said to him at the time you know when we when um when we decided we need to live apart</u>
<u n="87" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0041">I was like part of that reason is you've never been out of your comfort zone <pause dur="short"/> so you don't really know how how to form a bond with someone <pause dur="short"/> because</u>
<u n="89" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0041">he'd like he had the same part-time job growing up</u>
<u n="91" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0041">when he went to uni he kept it cos he went to uni in the same place he grew up in</u>
<u n="93" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0041">he never changed high school</u>
<u n="95" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0041">so the same types of people <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> he could stay friends with some <trunc>pe</trunc> er some people from his cos he went from high school to HND</u>
<u n="97" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0041">so he did leave his friends then <pause dur="short"/> but he lived near them so it wasn't an issue</u>
<u n="99" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0041">went to HND but then obviously you don't then leave college and go to uni <pause dur="short"/> cos it's HND conversion and everyone stays in the same stream so</u>
<u n="101" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0041">until he moved down here with me he'd never his choices consciously or not had never put him in a position where he'd have to work on friendships <pause dur="short"/> cos everyone's</u>
<u n="103" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="104" who="S0041">there all the time and</u>
<u n="105" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0041">so when he moved away I said to him you know it's hard <pause dur="short"/> it's hard being away from your friends <pause dur="short"/> and you have to make time for people <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="107" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0041">why don't you go and see <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>? And you know why don't you invite him up here? And he did a couple of times</u>
<u n="109" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0041">and not very often but</u>
<u n="111" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0041">but he said some really awful things Liz <pause dur="short"/> really awful things</u>
<u n="113" who="S0084">to you?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> about and not just about it being difficult to be around but you know saying I mean I was  I was I was  awful to him <pause dur="short"/> like the last six months we were together <pause dur="short"/> and I was very controlling <pause dur="short"/> and I did expect a lot from him <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="115" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0041">I know what he's getting at when he's saying that if we did something if something went wrong</u>
<u n="117" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="118" who="S0041">I used to freak out</u>
<u n="119" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0041">and I did  I did  Like</u>
<u n="121" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0041">I don't know why</u>
<u n="123" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="124" who="S0041">Cos <pause dur="short"/> and the strange thing is I'm not like it with anybody else <pause dur="short"/> I mean if I'd have gone out with Samara I didn't freak out <pause dur="short"/> it was just him</u>
<u n="125" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="126" who="S0041">because he didn't in hindsight I should've said this to him <pause dur="short"/> but I didn't think <pause dur="short"/> the only reason I was like that with him is because I carried him so much</u>
<u n="127" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0041">that I I didn't feel I could  I could  rely on him</u>
<u n="129" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0041">if we were planning to do something</u>
<u n="131" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0041">you know</u>
<u n="133" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's difficult to know though isn't it at the time</u>
<u n="134" who="S0041">it's</u>
<u n="135" who="S0084">Cos you sort of take that person for granted <pause dur="short"/> and you think you you sort of it gets worse and worse <pause dur="short"/> sort of you know snowballs <pause dur="short"/> and you end up</u>
<u n="136" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0084">treating them really badly without even realizing it</u>
<u n="138" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0084">because it takes for you to either wake up one day and think shit you know I've I've been a total cow and I'll try and be better</u>
<u n="140" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0084">or it takes for them to say do you know what? You've pushed me so far I don't think I can take it anymore</u>
<u n="142" who="S0041">and he never said that</u>
<u n="143" who="S0084">and he never did it <pause dur="short"/> so it's not</u>
<u n="144" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="145" who="S0084">it's you know it's it's circumstantial at this point because you broke up and that <trunc>w</trunc> there was a reason why you did that</u>
<u n="146" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> well I said to him I said to I said sorry <pause dur="short"/> and he was like I know you're sorry <pause dur="short"/> I know</u>
<u n="147" who="S0084">yeah</u>

<u n="155" who="S0084">oh honey <pause dur="short"/> come here  Come here  Don't get upset <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> it's there was so much going on <pause dur="short"/> feel like I'm a duck <pause dur="short"/> feel like I'm sticking my arse out <pause dur="short"/> do I look like a duck?</u>
<u n="156" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="157" who="S0084">come on <pause dur="short"/> don't wriggle away <pause dur="short"/> come on <pause dur="short"/> I don't really like hugging <pause dur="short"/> you know me <pause dur="short"/> that's fine</u>
<u n="158" who="S0041">and plus</u>
<u n="159" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="S0041">got on the scales</u>

<u n="163" who="S0084">shit <pause dur="short"/> fantastic</u>
<u n="164" who="S0041">and I was terrified of getting on them after sitting</u>
<u n="165" who="S0084">really?</u>
<u n="166" who="S0041">in bed and eating Camembert and Maltesers all week being ill <pause dur="short"/> all those Maltesers and chocolate I ate</u>

<u n="170" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="171" who="S0084">like er you know day to day they look different</u>
<u n="172" who="S0041">you just don't</u>
<u n="173" who="S0084">unless like um it's probably just the heels</u>
<u n="174" who="S0041">don't notice it</u>
<u n="175" who="S0084">to be fair <pause dur="short"/> probably just like lowered by BMI</u>

<u n="183" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="184" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> and I was like it's alright <pause dur="short"/> calm down <pause dur="short"/> it's alright <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I was like do you want to go? And he was like no no honestly I'm fine <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and so cos I'd got my arm there I was like stroking his arm <pause dur="short"/> and I was like honestly it's fine <pause dur="short"/> it's don't don't worry <pause dur="short"/> it's okay</u>
<u n="185" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="186" who="S0041">honestly <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> <pause dur="short"/> it's okay</u>
<u n="187" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0041">Cos he was just getting himself worked up more than anything <pause dur="short"/> you know there's nothing really to be scared of <pause dur="short"/> but er</u>
<u n="189" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="190" who="S0041">it's just daft</u>

<u n="669" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="670" who="S0041">but pretend it doesn't <pause dur="short"/> and I just get thirty grand a year</u>

<u n="678" who="S0041">hypothetically if I worked at it I reckon I could <pause dur="short"/> even without much thought</u>

<u n="1356" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> the wedding is in <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> which is the village she lives in <pause dur="short"/> so the annoying thing is we have to fly into <anon type="place"/> City Airport <pause dur="short"/> get to the hotel</u>

<u n="1358" who="S0084">you see thirteen minutes <pause dur="short"/> that can't be right <pause dur="short"/> is that right? I need to zoom out a bit <pause dur="short"/> cos that's not very helpful <pause dur="short"/> so you can see that's pretty close</u>

<u n="1364" who="S0084">quite annoying <pause dur="short"/> oh hang on <pause dur="short"/> that's the Barcelona thing <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> I would recommend flying into <anon type="place"/> City Airport as it's very close to the hotel and will only be a ten minute taxi ride <pause dur="short"/> then you can check in and use the facilities to get ready <pause dur="short"/> but I'll have to call to make sure we can check in early</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0084">then you get a train</u>

<u n="1379" who="S0041">got it</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0084">and that's the hotel <pause dur="short"/> so it'd be about forty-five minutes <pause dur="short"/> which in a <trunc>trai</trunc> in a cab would be</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0041">extortionate</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0084">extortionate <pause dur="short"/> so if we put in the hotel which is this</u>

<u n="1384" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0041">right <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> cos I was gonna say if not then depending on where she's getting married</u>

<u n="1387" who="S0041">we could actually get another hotel with the chain</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well that's what I was thinking</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0041">between the two</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> if we <trunc>t</trunc></u>

<u n="1392" who="S0084">oo</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0041">for a Holiday Inn</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0084">now that would be an option wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> like if if it's an option <pause dur="short"/> if there's a way</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0041">if there's a hotel half-way between with the last place we've got to get to her</u>
<u n="1398" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0041">and the International Airport</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="1402" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0041">then it would work out cheaper for us to do it that way</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0041">if that's a real life option</u>
<u n="1406" who="S0084">okay <pause dur="short"/> well the hotel to the village is twenty-five minutes</u>
<u n="1407" who="S0041">right</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0084">so worst case scenario we can just cab it <pause dur="short"/> which I think realistically is what we wanna be doing</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0084">if we're gonna do that way</u>
<u n="1411" who="S0041">yeah</u>

<u n="2561" who="S0041">obviously</u>
<u n="2562" who="S0084">is <anon type="place"/> City Airport <pause dur="short"/> and that is the hotel <pause dur="short"/> where they're getting married <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="2563" who="S0041">they're getting married at the hotel?</u>

<u n="2566" who="S0084">sorry</u>
<u n="2567" who="S0041">got it</u>
<u n="2568" who="S0084">so International Airport <pause dur="short"/> city Airport</u>
<u n="2569" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="2570" who="S0084">hotel where the reception is <pause dur="short"/> wedding venue</u>
<u n="2571" who="S0041">right <pause dur="short"/> and if er hypothetically</u>
<u n="2572" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="2573" who="S0041">we went from er airport</u>
<u n="2574" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="2575" who="S0041">to Holiday Inn</u>
<u n="2576" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="2577" who="S0041">to wedding</u>
<u n="2578" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="2579" who="S0041">to reception</u>
<u n="2580" who="S0084">party bus</u>
<u n="2581" who="S0041">then where does then?</u>
<u n="2582" who="S0084">that that is a bit of a bitch <pause dur="short"/> to get from there to a a mythical hotel here</u>
<u n="2583" who="S0041">right</u>
<u n="2584" who="S0084">I mean er honestly <trunc>pres</trunc> er it would be just as easy to get something in the city of Belfast</u>
<u n="2585" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="2586" who="S0084">because we could get a cab in or</u>
<u n="2587" who="S0041">or a train in</u>
<u n="2588" who="S0084">train just as easily</u>
<u n="2589" who="S0041">got it</u>
<u n="2590" who="S0084">into the city <pause dur="short"/> out again</u>
<u n="2591" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="2592" who="S0084">to the</u>
<u n="2593" who="S0041">for ten minutes</u>
<u n="2594" who="S0084">venue <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> because that would be easy to go to like the mainline train station</u>
<u n="2595" who="S0041">party bus it up</u>
<u n="2596" who="S0084">party bus</u>
<u n="2597" who="S0041">and</u>
<u n="2598" who="S0084">stay there</u>
<u n="2599" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="2600" who="S0084">or come back <pause dur="short"/> because we're there</u>
<u n="2601" who="S0041">because we're already there</u>
<u n="2602" who="S0084">rather than there</u>
<u n="2603" who="S0041">so really the next question is how much are the flights to the to this place?</u>
<u n="2604" who="S0084">international</u>
<u n="2605" who="S0041">and where are the Holiday Inns situated?</u>
<u n="2606" who="S0084">I um</u>
<u n="2607" who="S0041">oo oo oo</u>
<u n="2608" who="S0084">what are you doing?</u>
<u n="2609" who="S0041">oh free free blanket</u>
<u n="2610" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="2611" who="S0041">because we might find that on those dates</u>
<u n="2612" who="S0084"><shift new="singing"/><unclear/><shift new="normal"/></u>
<u n="2613" who="S0041">maybe it's no difference</u>
<u n="2614" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think the price is probably gonna be the same <pause dur="short"/> I think it's just gonna be how much of a hassle it is when we get there <pause dur="short"/> and in which case</u>
<u n="2615" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="2616" who="S0084">we might as well just <trunc>g</trunc> if we go from Heathrow we have to figure out how to get there <pause dur="short"/> because the flight's at seven A M</u>
<u n="2617" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="2618" who="S0084">so what we could do is stay with Chrissy in Brixton on the Thursday night</u>
<u n="2619" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="2620" who="S0084">kip on her floor <pause dur="short"/> the first Tube I looked from Brixton is five twenty-six A M <pause dur="short"/> little bit antisocial</u>
<u n="2621" who="S0041">huh</u>
<u n="2622" who="S0084">which is the first one <pause dur="short"/> and that starts at Victoria Line and and you can change at Green Park and pick up the Jubilee which takes you to Heathrow <pause dur="short"/> so er it should take about forty minutes <pause dur="short"/> so you'd probably get there at just after six <pause dur="short"/> flight's at seven <pause dur="short"/> in theory that should give you enough time <pause dur="short"/> cos we'd have done online check in <pause dur="short"/> just gotta get through</u>
<u n="2623" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="2624" who="S0084">um</u>
<u n="2625" who="S0041">just get through security</u>
<u n="2626" who="S0084">baggage <pause dur="short"/> so <vocal desc="cough"/> and <trunc>sh</trunc> in theory that'd be enough time <pause dur="short"/> or we can drive down and park up <pause dur="short"/> but we're looking at the parking like the cheapest parking is still like thirty quid overnight</u>
<u n="2627" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="2628" who="S0084">and it's literally like parking er at the bottom of the road <pause dur="short"/> like it's so far away from <trunc>ter</trunc> the terminal that</u>
<u n="2629" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="2630" who="S0084">you need</u>
<u n="2631" who="S0041">whereas if we did er fly to the the wrong airport</u>
<u n="2632" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="2633" who="S0041">and went from Stansted</u>
<u n="2634" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="2635" who="S0041">then <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> can get us <trunc>pr</trunc> the sales director can get us free parking and lounge entry for like a tenner per person <pause dur="short"/> so you get there you get free drinks</u>
<u n="2636" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="2637" who="S0041">and dinner and whatever <pause dur="short"/> like sandwiches <pause dur="short"/> I mean not that you're really gonna want it at that time in the morning <pause dur="short"/> let's be honest</u>
<u n="2638" who="S0084">but coming back <pause dur="short"/> and it's</u>
<u n="2639" who="S0041">coming back</u>
<u n="2640" who="S0084">good to know that you've got a lounge et cetera</u>
<u n="2641" who="S0041">to fall asleep in</u>
<u n="2642" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> so if we said we came back the next day cos we will  we will  want to <pause dur="short"/> and go</u>
<u n="2643" who="S0041">go now <pause dur="short"/> think you'd better go now</u>
<u n="2644" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/> So mm <pause dur="short"/> oh that's Gatwick <pause dur="short"/> we don't want Gatwick <pause dur="short"/> we want Stansted <pause dur="short"/> luton <pause dur="short"/> oh er huh <pause dur="short"/> stansted <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="2645" who="S0041">Stansted <pause dur="short"/> which date are we going on again? That one?</u>
<u n="2646" who="S0084"><vocal desc="cough"/> On the Friday <pause dur="short"/> yeah the wedding's on the Friday</u>
<u n="2647" who="S0041">right</u>
<u n="2648" who="S0084">so we get in at ten past nine</u>
<u n="2649" who="S0041">right</u>
<u n="2650" who="S0084">and then say we came back the next day <pause dur="short"/> what? Er at one thirty <pause dur="short"/> that gives us enough time to check out and stuff doesn't it <pause dur="short"/> and we'd get back at</u>
<u n="2651" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="2652" who="S0084">a decent time <pause dur="short"/> so that is considerably cheaper than  Oh <pause dur="short"/> I was like hang on wait a minute how does that make ninety-two pounds? That's for two of us</u>
<u n="2653" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="2654" who="S0084"><trunc>Whe</trunc> er whereas if we flew with BMI from Heathrow it'd be a hundred and fifty-five pounds <pause dur="short"/> and we'd be coming back much later on the Saturday</u>
<u n="2655" who="S0041">ah</u>
<u n="2656" who="S0084">which is a bit of a bitch because we'd get back to London the only flight left is this <trunc>o</trunc></u>
<u n="2657" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="2658" who="S0084">is this one <pause dur="short"/> oh hang on <pause dur="short"/> yeah we can do that <pause dur="short"/> oh we get in at six <pause dur="short"/> that's not too bad</u>
<u n="2659" who="S0041">it's not horrendous <pause dur="short"/> we'd be back for kind of eight o'clock</u>
<u n="2660" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> or if we wanted the cheaper one <vocal desc="cough"/> it'd be a hundred and thirty-three pounds <pause dur="short"/> but we wouldn't get in until half nine <pause dur="short"/> and then you've gotta get back across London</u>
<u n="2661" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="2662" who="S0084">you don't wanna be doing that</u>
<u n="2663" who="S0041">that's a bit of a killer</u>
<u n="2664" who="S0084">so realistically we'd have to do that one <pause dur="short"/> we still wouldn't get home until ten o'clock at the earliest probably <pause dur="short"/> cos</u>
<u n="2665" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="2666" who="S0084">by the time we get out across London on a Saturday evening <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so say that's a hundred and fifty-five</u>
<u n="2667" who="S0041">okay</u>
<u n="2668" who="S0084">and then that's a hundred <pause dur="short"/> I mean It's pretty cheap isn't it</u>
<u n="2669" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="2670" who="S0084">that is right? Stansted to <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah so we would fly in I've lost it here</u>
<u n="2671" who="S0041">right <pause dur="short"/> so next question is google Holiday Inn <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="2672" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="2673" who="S0041">or in fact before we do that</u>
<u n="2674" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="2675" who="S0041">we'll go and we'll just put the employee thing on</u>

<u n="3445" who="S0084">oh <pause dur="short"/> fff <pause dur="short"/> that's gone wrong hasn't it really <pause dur="short"/> but I mean gone are the days where you could get a flight for two P <pause dur="short"/> and any old bloody man and his dog could get on the plane</u>
<u n="3446" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="3447" who="S0084">in fact I actually did get a flight for two P to <anon type="place"/> from Stansted <pause dur="short"/> because they didn't charge you to pay on your <trunc>car</trunc></u>
<u n="3448" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="3449" who="S0084">did you just get charged to pay on your card?</u>
<u n="3450" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think it was less though than if you get charged to pay on a credit card</u>
<u n="3451" who="S0084">so do I owe you money for that though? How much did it come</u>
<u n="3452" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> it was all like that</u>
<u n="3453" who="S0084">did it still come to ninety-three? It was</u>

<u n="3455" who="S0084">altogether?</u>
<u n="3456" who="S0041">that was <unclear/> Yeah</u>
<u n="3457" who="S0084">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> yeah cos then if you pay on it used to be with Ryanair if you paid with Electron they didn't charge you <pause dur="short"/> vISA Electron <pause dur="short"/> but they do they charge you for everything now <pause dur="short"/> apart from their own credit card <pause dur="short"/> and er I booked it and with <trunc>ta</trunc> with there were no taxes no VAT <pause dur="short"/> I'm not quite sure how but it was two P <pause dur="short"/> and I so I used my mum's VISA Electron card <pause dur="short"/> paid for it <pause dur="short"/> gave her she was like you don't have to give me two P</u>
<u n="3458" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3459" who="S0084">so essentially it was free for me</u>
<u n="3460" who="S0041">free</u>
<u n="3461" who="S0084">cost my mum two P <pause dur="short"/> that's that's the most</u>
<u n="3462" who="S0041">God</u>
<u n="3463" who="S0084">bargainous flight in the world <pause dur="short"/> so then when I  when I  had to pay like a grand to fly to Australia</u>
<u n="3464" who="S0041">huh</u>
<u n="3465" who="S0084">I thought well I've had some really cheap flights in my life <pause dur="short"/> like I got</u>
<u n="3466" who="S0041">this is probably equalling itself out</u>
<u n="3467" who="S0084">yeah when I flew back from Cuba Will and I booked our flights in the January sale <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="cough"/> We flew back with Virgin <pause dur="short"/> obviously separately <pause dur="short"/> cos by that time we weren't talking to each other</u>
<u n="3468" who="S0041">of course</u>
<u n="3469" who="S0084">um <vocal desc="cough"/> I didn't realize cos he'd booked that flight and I'd booked the flight in to Texas and he booked the flight out of Havana <pause dur="short"/> and um I hadn't looked at the tickets until I'd got to the airport and realized it was premium economy <pause dur="short"/> and I knew that that flight only cost three hundred and ninety-five pounds to get from Havana to London <pause dur="short"/> and er they were like oh right this way <pause dur="short"/> and like no queuing <pause dur="short"/> you get in there</u>
<u n="3470" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3471" who="S0084">and you sit in the Virgin flights you sit upstairs <pause dur="short"/> like the hoi polloi all sit downstairs <pause dur="short"/> you go upstairs to premium economy <pause dur="short"/> armchairs <pause dur="short"/> er have a glass of champagne <pause dur="short"/> sit on down <pause dur="short"/> here's your flight socks <pause dur="short"/> what would you like to eat for dinner? They serve you with gloves</u>
<u n="3472" who="S0041">really?</u>
<u n="3473" who="S0084">the whole shebang <pause dur="short"/> and it cost me three hundred and ninety-five pounds <pause dur="short"/> and er there was this old boy in the seat next to me <pause dur="short"/> and he's does a lot of business in the Caribbean and I didn't really ask him much about it <pause dur="short"/> and er I was like can't believe this <pause dur="short"/> I got my flight for four hundred quid <pause dur="short"/> and he was like what are you talking about?</u>
<u n="3474" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3475" who="S0084">and I said oh I got my flight in the January sale <pause dur="short"/> how <trunc>cleve</trunc> cos by this point it's like the end of May <pause dur="short"/> and er he said this flight cost me two thousand pounds</u>
<u n="3476" who="S0041">huh</u>
<u n="3477" who="S0084">he was rich though <pause dur="short"/> he could afford it <pause dur="short"/> but I was just like I didn't  I didn't</u>
<u n="3478" who="S0041">gutted to be you</u>
<u n="3479" who="S0084">at that point er I didn't realize how much of a deal it was</u>
<u n="3480" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="3481" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was really really  really good  really good <pause dur="short"/> cos that's what I was hoping I'd be able to do this year with the New York flights <pause dur="short"/> but they just haven't come down in price at all <pause dur="short"/> like you I think the best option is really to book it last minute</u>
<u n="3482" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="3483" who="S0084">and get a cheaper deal that way <pause dur="short"/> rather than try and book ahead <pause dur="short"/> cos I don't think</u>
<u n="3484" who="S0041">just wait until the weekend</u>
<u n="3485" who="S0084">think they go down</u>
<u n="3486" who="S0041">and just say look I can go tomorrow</u>
<u n="3487" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> just I'll go on standby <pause dur="short"/> just put me on a flight</u>
<u n="3488" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> how much do they go down by then if you go on standby?</u>
<u n="3489" who="S0084">A few hundred quid</u>
<u n="3490" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="3491" who="S0084">Cos they wanna fill the plane <pause dur="short"/> so they'll put you on rather than put nobody on</u>
<u n="3492" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well that's good then</u>
<u n="3493" who="S0084">you I think you could probably talk them down <pause dur="short"/> when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> er actually before I was with him and his then girlfriend flew out to Australia they were there for a year <pause dur="short"/> they were living in Melbourne <pause dur="short"/> I'd speak to them every so often <pause dur="short"/> and they'd say you know just get a flight <pause dur="short"/> you know just come out <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>re</trunc> it can be really cheap er you know come out on standby <pause dur="short"/> be like four hundred quid <pause dur="short"/> I was like it's such a risk though <pause dur="short"/> like if you've only got a couple of weeks off work you can't really justify staying in Heathrow Airport for a couple of days waiting for a flight or waiting</u>
<u n="3494" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="3495" who="S0084">for a seat to come up <pause dur="short"/> like it's it is a bit of a gamble <pause dur="short"/> but you're better off doing that as a loner than you are with a family</u>
<u n="3496" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's okay if  it's okay if  you're going out to stay with someone</u>
<u n="3497" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="3498" who="S0041">but if you're paying for a hotel</u>
<u n="3499" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="3500" who="S0041">that's the killer isn't it? Cos then you</u>
<u n="3501" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="3502" who="S0041">you're paying for days in the hotel that you're not there</u>
<u n="3503" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's why when any sort of natural disasters happen you're better off being a loner <pause dur="short"/> like being a lone back-packer or whatever <pause dur="short"/> cos they always deal with you first</u>
<u n="3504" who="S0041">oh do they?</u>
<u n="3505" who="S0084">Cos yeah what they do oh I wanna remember who was telling me this <pause dur="short"/> someone's friend works at the airport <pause dur="short"/> it might've been <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who I stay with in Melbourne <pause dur="short"/> she was saying that when the volcano errupted and when the snow came you know er people are stranded <pause dur="short"/> what they do is they target the people who are on their own <pause dur="short"/> particularly back-packer <trunc>c</trunc> back-packers cos er then they're going away for ages <pause dur="short"/> and they'll say look we'll pay your hotel costs but we'll just put you on a flight in a couple of days' time <pause dur="short"/> is that alright? And they go fine</u>
<u n="3506" who="S0041">whatever</u>
<u n="3507" who="S0084">so they'll just put them up in like er the nearest three star hotel for a couple of nights <pause dur="short"/> cos what is that? A few hundred quid? And then they'll which they claim back on the insurance anyway I suppose and then they prioritize the families cos they're the ones that are gonna kick off cos they've only got like a five day holiday booked <pause dur="short"/> so you're better off being a loner actually most of the time <pause dur="short"/> because</u>
<u n="3508" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="3509" who="S0084">the airlines will actually give you quite a good deal</u>
<u n="3510" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="3511" who="S0084">Cos and then</u>
<u n="3512" who="S0041">well it makes sense really doesn't it?</u>
<u n="3513" who="S0084">yeah and then you say oh I'm staying in a five star hotel when I get to Bangkok and they're like no you're not</u>
<u n="3514" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3515" who="S0084">you're staying somewhere that's gonna cost you <vocal desc="laugh"/> three pounds a night</u>
<u n="3516" who="S0041">you're not <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="3517" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3518" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="3519" who="S0084">look at you <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3520" who="S0041">you say I work for IHG oh that's the thing um you know I always just think you know cheap hotels that's great <pause dur="short"/> don't really think much about it</u>
<u n="3521" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="3522" who="S0041">but um I chose this one cos er of the feel of it <pause dur="short"/> would you have guessed?</u>
<u n="3523" who="S0084">it's pretty nice</u>
<u n="3524" who="S0041">can't help but touch</u>
<u n="3525" who="S0084">I like all the um the the detail</u>
<u n="3526" who="S0041">er yes so</u>

<u n="3531" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="3532" who="S0041">I kid you not</u>
<u n="3533" who="S0084">how many of them are there?</u>
<u n="3534" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> four five</u>
<u n="3535" who="S0084">fucking hell</u>
<u n="3536" who="S0041">five? Two grand a night</u>

<u n="3541" who="S0084">er that's the point when you just think right back-packing around France with the family it is then</u>
<u n="3542" who="S0041">it is yeah <pause dur="short"/> caravan it up</u>
<u n="3543" who="S0084">you can't have twenty-six grand holidays</u>
<u n="3544" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> so he was like what the hell? And then he found out that he could get um employee rate at the InterContinental</u>
<u n="3545" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="3546" who="S0041">and now his whole holiday not including flights er for the two weeks is costing him two and a half grand</u>
<u n="3547" who="S0084">nice</u>
<u n="3548" who="S0041">compared to twenty-six <pause dur="short"/> five star InterContinental</u>
<u n="3549" who="S0084">sweet</u>
<u n="3550" who="S0041">and you think really they could charge maybe not twenty-six grand but I'm sure it's about fifteen <pause dur="short"/> it's quite a lot <pause dur="short"/> I know the quote that he got er he got a <trunc>l</trunc> a lot less than half price</u>
<u n="3551" who="S0084">wow</u>

<u n="3559" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="3560" who="S0041">so he can get a family room</u>

<u n="3585" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="3586" who="S0041">because people have been paid</u>

<u n="3589" who="S0084">true that  true that</u>
<u n="3590" who="S0041">so cos I I mean I don't really mind not doing it at my birthday time <pause dur="short"/> cos we could always do it the month after <pause dur="short"/> and do it some time in June</u>

<u n="4004" who="S0041">to make us up to sixty <pause dur="short"/> and we don't book out any more <pause dur="short"/> cos we can sell the rooms for three hundred pound a go <pause dur="short"/> whereas if I  if I  book them in advance then my client'll want it at one forty</u>

<u n="4270" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> I didn't see a lot of it cos I fell asleep <pause dur="short"/> cos I was shattered after London</u>
<u n="4271" who="S0084">oh yeah</u>
<u n="4272" who="S0041">but um actually it makes me sound really racist but some of the stuff he was saying was quite true</u>
<u n="4273" who="S0084">what were they saying?</u>
<u n="4274" who="S0041">I only saw a small part of it <pause dur="short"/> but basically he was saying that um at the moment three percent of the population are Muslim</u>
<u n="4275" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="4276" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> and they weren't concentrating I mean the problem was that he was broadening what he was saying <pause dur="short"/> he was being a bit too general <pause dur="short"/> but he basically showed you a lot of footage of extreme Muslims protesting in the streets <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> saying how gays were wrong and this and that was wrong <pause dur="short"/> and you should follow Muslim and the <trunc>b</trunc> it showed you the real extreme Muslims</u>
<u n="4277" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4278" who="S0041">really extreme <pause dur="short"/> and they're basically taking to the street and</u>
<u n="4279" who="S0084">yeah but they're putting those two things together and confusing the matter <pause dur="short"/> so they're saying that there's three percent of the country is made up of Muslims <pause dur="short"/> and then they're showing you footage of extremist Muslims</u>
<u n="4280" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="4281" who="S0084">and in your mind making the connection that all Muslims are extremists</u>
<u n="4282" who="S0041">no he wasn't actually <pause dur="short"/> he wasn't saying that</u>
<u n="4283" who="S0084">but they're not <pause dur="short"/> but but then the fact that they're showing extremist footage <pause dur="short"/> you've got er the EDL marching <pause dur="short"/> they're extremists</u>
<u n="4284" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> well he was saying he wasn't saying that three per cent of the country is now extreme Muslim</u>
<u n="4285" who="S0084"><vocal desc="cough"/> mm</u>
<u n="4286" who="S0041">he said there's only three per cent of the country that is Muslim</u>
<u n="4287" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4288" who="S0041">however that means that there's ninety-seven per cent</u>
<u n="4289" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4290" who="S0041">which are other religions</u>
<u n="4291" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4292" who="S0041">in the percentage of the three per cent</u>
<u n="4293" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4294" who="S0041">which are extreme Muslims which are they're putting all these posters on the street</u>
<u n="4295" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4296" who="S0041">um recruiting more radical Muslims</u>
<u n="4297" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4298" who="S0041">to follow this guy's name I don't know cos I wasn't really paying a lot of attention</u>
<u n="4299" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4300" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> and you know force girls into marriage and really really extreme views</u>
<u n="4301" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4302" who="S0041">but the the kind of idea of a conversion rate between the three percent Muslim</u>
<u n="4303" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4304" who="S0041">and the percentage of those that are extreme</u>
<u n="4305" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4306" who="S0041">was really very high <pause dur="short"/> whereas the he was arguing that the percentage of people of other religions converting them to like BNP style</u>
<u n="4307" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4308" who="S0041">craziness</u>
<u n="4309" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4310" who="S0041">the conversion rate is much smaller <pause dur="short"/> and so he said the reason why we're campaigning against it is not campaigning against a race but rather campaigning against a religion which would encourage people to do that <pause dur="short"/> and the guy that was filming was saying but it's not er a religion that's encouraging people to do that <pause dur="short"/> it's the people <pause dur="short"/> like</u>
<u n="4311" who="S0084">exactly</u>
<u n="4312" who="S0041">it's the crazy people</u>
<u n="4313" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="4314" who="S0041">and he said but either way the only correlation is the thing that they believe in <pause dur="short"/> and if they can justify  if they can justify  it</u>
<u n="4315" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4316" who="S0041">then can you imagine when we become more multi-cultural and twenty per cent of the country is Muslim?</u>
<u n="4317" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4318" who="S0041">once you up that conversion rate you're to an extent that we won't be able to control anymore</u>
<u n="4319" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4320" who="S0041">and it wasn't he wasn't as racist as I expected him to be</u>
<u n="4321" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4322" who="S0041">like I expected it to be like holy fuck this this man needs burning at the stake</u>
<u n="4323" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4324" who="S0041">and he he was er he was really quite extreme but he wasn't irrational <pause dur="short"/> which was surprising <pause dur="short"/> he <trunc>di</trunc> he seemed quite educated <trunc>f</trunc> <trunc>t</trunc> for a yob <pause dur="short"/> you know he was still blatantly a  blatantly a  yob</u>
<u n="4325" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="4326" who="S0041">but um I know it er doesn't really make sense does it</u>
<u n="4327" who="S0084">I think it's all  it's all  it's just what he says is very suspicious <pause dur="short"/> like where is he getting his facts from? It seems very unlikely</u>
<u n="4328" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="4329" who="S0084">that he's actually done any proper research <pause dur="short"/> because really he</u>
<u n="4330" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="4331" who="S0084">wanted to believe what he's saying <pause dur="short"/> you've got a small proportion of people three per cent a conversion rate on three per cent is gonna be higher than a conversion rate on the same number of people</u>
<u n="4332" who="S0041">that's what the filmer was saying</u>
<u n="4333" who="S0084">and you know we live in an actual fact like white British people are becoming more secular</u>
<u n="4334" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="4335" who="S0084">so we're er veering away from being a religious country</u>
<u n="4336" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="4337" who="S0084">which is allowing for a greater rise in other types of religion <pause dur="short"/> so you know</u>

<u n="4348" who="S0041">it's all that's the thing</u>
<u n="4349" who="S0084">and he's gonna say anything he can <pause dur="short"/> in fact <trunc>m</trunc> educated extremists are far more dangerous than yob extremists <pause dur="short"/> because</u>
<u n="4350" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="4351" who="S0084">they're more eloquent <pause dur="short"/> they can put together an argument <pause dur="short"/> and they can encourage people who are living in areas that are becoming run down</u>
