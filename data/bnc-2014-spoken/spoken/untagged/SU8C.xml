<u n="1586" who="S0008">and they bring it up to the sort of nearly mint condition and then sell it and try and make a profit on it</u>
<u n="1587" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1588" who="S0008">the fact that they don't take the workshop expenses apart from the cost factor you know</u>
<u n="1589" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1590" who="S0008">and there's this bloke who goes out and does the buying and there's this other bloke who does all the work in the thing</u>

<u n="1595" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1596" who="S0008">so what they have to do is we take the wheel off and then there's a nut here you have to undo you undo the nut and then you can draw the hub and the bearing comes off of the hub and then to get the bearing up you know you take and he says you can do this job yourself you know cos the cost of the bearing is quite and it's all fairly straightforward</u>
<u n="1597" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="1598" who="S0008">and he says and while we've got the hub down we'll just check the shock absorbers to make sure it's not leaking and this one's <trunc>al</trunc> oh oh this one's leaking a bit oh well so what we do we just undo this nut here draw it out to the spring put a new one in when you're doing this it's best to do the other one as well to balance it out and so we do <trunc>th</trunc> you know and he goes through it</u>
<u n="1599" who="S0012"><unclear/></u>
