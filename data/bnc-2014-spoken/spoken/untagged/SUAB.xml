<u n="1003" who="S0091">mm</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0058">so it's all very expensive</u>

<u n="1020" who="S0179">um actually have you got a map? We can have a look at it after lunch</u>

<u n="1023" who="S0058">and now it's just North Cambridge</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0179">but um yes bottom line um buying rather than renting definitely the way to go <pause dur="short"/> um it's infinitely cheaper to get something of the same size and quality <pause dur="short"/> let alone the fact you end up owning it</u>

<u n="1102" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> cos there's loads of nice um sort of because of this the town was built from scratch there's loads of er nice bridleways and footpaths and er what-not <pause dur="short"/> there's also about four lakes</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> They've they've put in lots of a few too many <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="1104" who="S0179">they also got one up on the Ordnance Survey <pause dur="short"/> er because they've built a hill since the Ordnance Survey did the the um maps of the village <pause dur="short"/> so <vocal desc="laugh"/> the the contour lines aren't now strictly accurate <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1105" who="S0058">it's a nice hill <pause dur="short"/> I'm glad they built it <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="1114" who="S0179">something in that ballpark</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0179">um <pause dur="short"/> what else has been happening? Um <unclear/> now I can't remember what <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> oh um Volvo are releasing a new car um which has got an airbag for pedestrians <pause dur="short"/> which is slightly strange <pause dur="short"/> er so the idea is it uses radar um on the front of it <pause dur="short"/> and if it detects that you're going to hit a pedestrian an airbag pops out of the bonnet</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1118" who="S0091">well <unclear/> how how does it work then? Because er you'd need something <unclear/> till it'll respond don't you?</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0179">um no it it well it uses er half radar half um tut tu tu tu tu a um it's got an er it's got a camera er like a video camera</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0091">mm</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0179">and it has image processing <pause dur="short"/> so it can tell if a shape on the camera looks like a person <pause dur="short"/> and if it thinks you're about to hit it um it brakes the car automatically um and deploys the airbag <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1122" who="S0058">so the bonnet pops up and then it</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0058">comes out</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0091">and the same if you get too close to a car</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0058">mhm</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0179">um</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0058">how's it?</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0179">only then it doesn't use the airbag it just brakes</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0091">what happens to the bloke behind you?</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> You need an airbag at the back as well for them to to bounce off <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1133" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> well <unclear/> it seemed like er quite an interesting idea <pause dur="short"/> I'd love to see that working</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0091">mm</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0058">well there'll probably be videos of it <pause dur="short"/> they'll release um</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0058">Cos don't they do like crash test</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0058">videos? So there'll probably be one of this airbag <pause dur="short"/> they'll have a like a figurine a a crash test dummy standing and</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="1142" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1143" who="S0179"><unclear/> be quite fun <pause dur="short"/> and of course it covers the windscreen <pause dur="short"/> so it does raise the slight problem that if it's deployed <pause dur="short"/> actually no the brakes will be on if it's deployed</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0179">so you're not going anywhere anyway</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1147" who="S0179">um</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0058"></u>
<u n="1149" who="S0091">do they still make cars with airbags in the steering wheel?</u>
<u n="1150" who="S0179">oh yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh but nowadays cars tend to have about seven airbags inside <pause dur="short"/> so you have one in the steering wheel <pause dur="short"/> one in front of the front seat passenger <pause dur="short"/> um one each side of the so in the side of the driver's seat and the side of the passenger's seat <pause dur="short"/> one for the driver's knees</u>
