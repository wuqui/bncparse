<u n="11" who="S0180">is that is it a crunch game or something? Cos West Ham can't</u>
<u n="12" who="S0070">well it would've been</u>
<u n="13" who="S0180">get automatic <unclear/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0070">I I I think if they probably if they win every game and and Reading and Southampton don't</u>
<u n="15" who="S0180">ah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0070">it <trunc>probab</trunc> they probably could <pause dur="short"/> but to be honest <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> they don't deserve automatic promotion</u>
<u n="17" who="S0180"><vocal desc="laugh"/> You want them to suffer a bit more</u>
<u n="18" who="S0070">I want them to suffer <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>

<u n="27" who="S0180">Cos they're gonna</u>
<u n="28" who="S0070">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> for sure <pause dur="short"/> and I think you know Southampton should because they've been up there pretty much the whole of the season <pause dur="short"/> and Reading have kind of crept up slowly and you know well done to them <pause dur="short"/> and it's odd because West Ham <trunc>wer</trunc> were singing when um when they equalized on was it Monday night</u>
<u n="29" who="S0180">oh yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0070">they were singing to the the who were they playing? Who were they playing? Birmingham fans <pause dur="short"/> three nil and you gave it away <pause dur="short"/> three three one and you gave it away <pause dur="short"/> three one and you gave it away <pause dur="short"/> and I was thinking hang on a minute <pause dur="short"/> you were one nil and you gave it away last week you were</u>
<u n="31" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="32" who="S0070">two one up against Reading <pause dur="short"/> and you and actual fact you were on the top of the championship and you gave that away <pause dur="short"/> It's <vocal desc="laugh"/> West Ham's history to give it away <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="33" who="S0180">it's pot calling kettle black</u>
<u n="34" who="S0070">yeah exactly <anon type="name" nameType="m"/><pause dur="short"/> they're just daft <pause dur="short"/> they really are daft and</u>
<u n="35" who="S0180">Cos you oh you went to that game as well?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0070">mm <pause dur="short"/> monday</u>
<u n="37" who="S0180">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's the one that I was gonna go</u>
<u n="38" who="S0070">one nil up</u>
<u n="39" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0070">and then they went two one down in the space of two minutes <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0180">look how they've advertised it <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Top of the table clash or something <pause dur="short"/> but it looks like they're not gonna <pause dur="short"/> that was printed recently <pause dur="short"/> that's today's Metro</u>
<u n="42" who="S0070">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos it's Saturday so</u>
<u n="43" who="S0180">push for a promotion</u>
<u n="44" who="S0070">no I mean <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> and and Brighton are <trunc>par</trunc> just out of the er at the</u>
<u n="45" who="S0180">oh no</u>
<u n="46" who="S0070">playoff places</u>
<u n="47" who="S0180">the fourth position <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0070">so they're  so they're  trying to sort of</u>
<u n="49" who="S0180">are we</u>
<u n="50" who="S0070">they lost last night</u>
<u n="51" who="S0180">I always think it's unfair when the teams in the playoffs <pause dur="short"/> that's just the way it is isn't it <pause dur="short"/> but the the third place team like um <unclear/> where Luton are playing</u>
<u n="52" who="S0070">mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0180">third place team is Wrexham</u>
<u n="54" who="S0070">uh-huh</u>
<u n="55" who="S0180">and they've got ninety points <pause dur="short"/> sorry the second team</u>
<u n="56" who="S0070">oh okay</u>
<u n="57" who="S0180">first team qualifies automatically</u>
<u n="58" who="S0070">mm</u>
<u n="59" who="S0180">they've got a hundred and one points <unclear/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0070">right</u>
<u n="61" who="S0180">Wrexham was second</u>
<u n="62" who="S0070">mhm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0180">at ninety points during the play-offs <pause dur="short"/> the team below them are with eighty points</u>
<u n="64" who="S0070">okay</u>
<u n="65" who="S0180">and the two teams below them have got seventy-one</u>
<u n="66" who="S0070">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0180">so Wrexham could go into the play-offs with a team that are twenty points behind them</u>
<u n="68" who="S0070">and lose</u>
<u n="69" who="S0180">ah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0070">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0180">it doesn't seem fair does it</u>
<u n="72" who="S0070">not really</u>
<u n="73" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0070">but then again you know with something someone like West Ham it is <trunc>f</trunc> fair</u>
<u n="75" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="76" who="S0070">because they they've been arseholes <pause dur="short"/> and they deserve to you know where a team like Brighton who came up from the division two last year didn't they?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think so</u>

<u n="85" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exeter <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> hopeless team aren't they <pause dur="short"/> and Luton <pause dur="short"/> luton are not even in the playoffs now</u>

<u n="241" who="S0180">aha <pause dur="short"/> you can type away</u>
<u n="242" who="S0070">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it takes you so long <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> like <trunc>f</trunc> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was saying about this as well <pause dur="short"/> you know that it's not something that you can just sit down</u>
<u n="243" who="S0180">no</u>
<u n="244" who="S0070">and sort of like oh I'll just have half an hour here and half an hour there <pause dur="short"/> it takes you half an hour to kind of get back into the zone</u>
<u n="245" who="S0180">but do you have like a stream of consciousness and then you go back and edit it? Or</u>

<u n="250" who="S0070">well yeah and I think that's a cos I tend to to sort of sit down and try and do it in my head <pause dur="short"/> and then try to write it perfectly first time <pause dur="short"/> but it's of course it's impossible isn't it <pause dur="short"/> it's better just to get your ideas down and then play around with them <pause dur="short"/> cos cos you can't cos it it's funny isn't it like you know these I was gonna say <trunc>t</trunc> to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that  that you  you sometimes you can only explain things by writing it</u>
<u n="251" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="252" who="S0070">Cos it it</u>
<u n="253" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="254" who="S0070">it's impossible to say it <pause dur="short"/> and and</u>
<u n="255" who="S0180">you need to have more clauses</u>
<u n="256" who="S0070">exactly</u>
<u n="257" who="S0180">in your writing</u>
<u n="258" who="S0070">yeah <pause dur="short"/> which you couldn't do if you were  if you were  speaking without someone losing <trunc>con</trunc> train of thought</u>
<u n="259" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="260" who="S0070">right</u>
<u n="261" who="S0180">that's an interesting um <trunc>d</trunc> differentiation isn't it</u>
<u n="262" who="S0070">it is  it is  Yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I was  I was  thinking how <trunc>y</trunc> you know by writing is also is where you you also get ideas</u>
<u n="263" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="264" who="S0070">as well and</u>
<u n="265" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="266" who="S0070">that you'd never probably <pause dur="short"/> I don't know how it  how it  happens but um</u>
<u n="267" who="S0180">and you can focus on your train of thought and so can the reader</u>

<u n="328" who="S0070">mm</u>
<u n="329" who="S0180">she was a bit all over the not all over the place she had some good ideas but she didn't know how to simply yeah simply structure it</u>

<u n="331" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well obviously they didn't do much for her</u>

<u n="335" who="S0180">yeah</u>

<u n="347" who="S0180">she said <pause dur="short"/> that was quite positive</u>
<u n="348" who="S0070">okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean I can imagine that they are a bit more clued in like that than some of the others that we had run-ins with who want just what's the answer? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="349" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and you could see they got really impatient didn't they <pause dur="short"/> some of them <pause dur="short"/> with the exploration part of the MA</u>
<u n="350" who="S0070">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="351" who="S0180">the whole point of an MA is to explore your analyze</u>
<u n="352" who="S0070">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's a research degree isn't it</u>
<u n="353" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but they seem very impatient with that <pause dur="short"/> they each wanted an answer</u>
<u n="354" who="S0070">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="355" who="S0180">and like <pause dur="short"/> that's not the spirit of an MA is it</u>
<u n="356" who="S0070">not really <pause dur="short"/> they should do a teacher training course like a diploma</u>
<u n="357" who="S0180">but why would it makes you realize doesn't it <pause dur="short"/> I mean we're in education but we think there are only set answers <pause dur="short"/> that's quite scary actually</u>
<u n="358" who="S0070">I suppose</u>
<u n="359" who="S0180">we weren't prepared to think outside the box</u>
<u n="360" who="S0070">no</u>
<u n="361" who="S0180">were we</u>
<u n="362" who="S0070">but then I suppose if they come from backgrounds er where education does provide the answers then</u>
<u n="363" who="S0180">mm <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="364" who="S0070">then that's what they</u>
<u n="365" who="S0180">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> you have  you have  Uzbekistan Thailand Greece even</u>
<u n="366" who="S0070">mm</u>
<u n="367" who="S0180">Greece is quite <pause dur="short"/> it's not cutting edge I think</u>
<u n="368" who="S0070">I would imagine</u>

<u n="783" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="784" who="S0070">we went <pause dur="short"/> and we thought go to a a country which has a different religion</u>
<u n="785" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="786" who="S0070">but because it was a tourist part of Istanbul</u>
<u n="787" who="S0180">Istanbul wasn't it</u>
<u n="788" who="S0070">yeah</u>
<u n="789" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="790" who="S0070">and because it was</u>
<u n="791" who="S0180">very touristy</u>
<u n="792" who="S0070">very touristy</u>
<u n="793" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="794" who="S0070">they were celebrating Christmas more than we celebrate it here</u>
<u n="795" who="S0180">really? mm</u>
<u n="796" who="S0070">so all the shops had happy Christmas sprayed on it and</u>
<u n="797" who="S0180"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="799" who="S0180">mm</u>

<u n="801" who="S0180"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="802" who="S0070">and then and so in the <trunc>bi</trunc></u>
<u n="803" who="S0180">too commercialized</u>
<u n="804" who="S0070">too commercialized <pause dur="short"/> and then outside was also too commercialized</u>
<u n="805" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="806" who="S0070">because you walk down the street and they everybody wants to sell you something</u>
<u n="807" who="S0180">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="808" who="S0070">oh buy a carpet <pause dur="short"/> come in <pause dur="short"/> have a look at this</u>
<u n="809" who="S0180"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="810" who="S0070">give you a tour up the Bosphorus <pause dur="short"/> I can Cappadocia</u>
<u n="811" who="S0180">did you go to the um well my last boss went to  went to  Turkey a lot <pause dur="short"/> but he</u>
<u n="812" who="S0070">mhm</u>
<u n="813" who="S0180">he went to the coast</u>
<u n="814" who="S0070">okay</u>
<u n="815" who="S0180">where there are lots of Roman ruins</u>
<u n="816" who="S0070">ah</u>

<u n="818" who="S0070">yeah</u>
<u n="819" who="S0180">yeah he avoided Istanbul</u>
<u n="820" who="S0070">yeah I think I I would advise anybody to</u>
<u n="821" who="S0180">nice to visit there but probably off season <pause dur="short"/> not on season</u>
<u n="822" who="S0070">off season <pause dur="short"/> and probably it's best if you do it as a coach <trunc>tr</trunc> I would say a coach tour would be ideal</u>
<u n="823" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="824" who="S0070">because er they would take you to the  to the  sort of the important landmarks</u>
<u n="825" who="S0180">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="826" who="S0070">and you would <trunc>y</trunc> you know you go to the Grand Bazaar which is interesting to have a look at <pause dur="short"/> but they whisk you through it</u>
<u n="827" who="S0180">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you don't have your freedom to go <trunc>ba</trunc> I don't like tours like that</u>
<u n="828" who="S0070">well I don't <pause dur="short"/> but but normally I don't but in a <trunc>s</trunc> in a place where you get constant hassle from the people</u>
<u n="829" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="830" who="S0070">it's probably best to go in a  in a  tour group <pause dur="short"/> because you know me and my wife would go out in the morning and in the evening just for a walk <pause dur="short"/> and you can't look at anything in the shop</u>
<u n="831" who="S0180">yeah</u>
<u n="832" who="S0070">because someone <trunc>wan</trunc> as soon as you look at something they want to sell it to you</u>
<u n="833" who="S0180">mm</u>
<u n="834" who="S0070">they don't have that same kind of window shopping</u>

<u n="841" who="S0180">I think that happens anywhere now <pause dur="short"/> er you have to go really off off the beaten track <pause dur="short"/> you have to go somewhere where they haven't not many tourists really</u>
<u n="842" who="S0070">mm</u>
<u n="843" who="S0180">Cos most <trunc>t</trunc> places destinations in the world will be</u>
