<u n="1" who="S0282">right so I'm gonna start it out now so so we can talk about the kinds of things you wanted to get my <pause dur="short"/> feedback on</u>
<u n="2" who="S0645">right okay right well first and foremost like I said was talking about this erm er who who do you reckon would be the first person to contact?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0282">about the conversion of this space?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0645">yeah about the structural sort of possibilities cos if they then if they've gotta stay connected to these stud walls for some unknown weird reason then that sort of stops it going ahead</u>
<u n="5" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="6" who="S0645">cos we can't go putting in any more supports it will be intrusive enough to have a space that's got these steels and just about saleable with those steels all the way through the room</u>
<u n="7" who="S0282">yeah erm I erm I think it's very <unclear/> because I think that if we <pause dur="short"/> that a conversion of the building happened in the seventies and the eighties and that was definitely his work and he was in charge so there were two phases of works one in nineteen seventy-five seventy-six and then the next in nineteen eighty and then the works carried on between then and nineteen eighty-six nineteen eighty-seven</u>
<u n="8" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0282">so erm and he was the architect for all of that work and that was the point at which they put the theatre in downstairs and these spaces upstairs were converted into those erm kind of little shed things</u>
<u n="10" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0282">the little chicken wire sheds that we saw in that photograph out there so whether these struts are part of keeping the ceiling <trunc>k</trunc> part of keeping the roof up because we are actually in a what would've been a disused space</u>
<u n="12" who="S0645" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0282">so whether they took something else out some other kind of structural support or some other kind of structural if <unclear>so much</unclear> other structural erm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0645">I would've thought there would've been roof joists standard roof joists</u>
<u n="15" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0645">cos that's what steels was there to replace</u>
<u n="17" who="S0282">but then we've got a flat roof here so I don't know what's above this roof there is a there is actually a <unclear>crawl</unclear> space above isn't isn't there? <unclear/></u>
<u n="18" who="S0645">yeah there is an attic <unclear/></u>
<u n="19" who="S0282">there is an attic have you been up there? have you had a look up there?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0645" trans="overlap">yeah it's got no but no but there wouldn't be any joists all the way along it then</u>
<u n="21" who="S0282">but you could have you could stick your head through that hole and see what's holding the roof up because this could be part of some structure from <unclear>but</unclear> above that's actually holding</u>
<u n="22" who="S0645" trans="overlap">yeah yeah mm</u>
<u n="23" who="S0282">the roof up above or erm</u>
<u n="24" who="S0645">well if it's anything above there that's not gonna be an issue but if it's like I say if it's if if for some er weird reason they've put these erm braces roof braces roof ties whatever they're gonna be actually called on non-load-bearing walls which is what all these are</u>
<u n="25" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0645">then that'd be weird and <unclear/></u>
<u n="27" who="S0282" trans="overlap">but do they go through? I mean is that is that <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0645">yeah they go all the way through yeah these struts yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0282" trans="overlap">that goes all the way through so that bit there will go has got a bit that then travels across that office and the next office</u>
<u n="30" who="S0645" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah they erm they criss-cross but I think the upright extensions that they'll stand on are behind the outside walls</u>
<u n="31" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0645">so yeah the uprights and the bits that we really really can't remove</u>
<u n="33" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="34" who="S0645">are in the space that we don't wanna touch anyway</u>
<u n="35" who="S0282">yeah that's fine</u>
<u n="36" who="S0645" trans="overlap">so that'd be ideal I think <unclear/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0282">all I'm worried about is these metals struts the <unclear/></u>
<u n="38" who="S0645">the metal struts we can't move but I don't think they'll stop us selling the room I mean if they come to sort of here at the at the most if you opened up that room and had that space double if you were doing a dance class in here there's still space in between them</u>
<u n="39" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0645">to actually use erm I mean it's still a usable space you could set the room up <unclear/> anything like that and still be able to see they're not they're not that big that they're sort of gonna be a restrictive view for anybody it's not like having a a big concrete pillar or something in the in the theatre or whatever</u>
<u n="41" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="42" who="S0645">it's erm it's a minor hindrance really I mean it'd be a pain for sort of Krav Maga and stuff like that</u>
<u n="43" who="S0282">well yeah that would be dangerous wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="44" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0282">if they'd trip over them</u>
<u n="46" who="S0645">yeah well that's it and you'd you'd hit into them but if it's</u>
<u n="47" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0645">sedate activities like dancing and stuff like that where it's more erm it's more controlled <unclear/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0282">well I don't know what kind of stuff <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> does what kind of dancing <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> does but</u>
<u n="50" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0282">erm I think it's all kinds I mean I've I can't er I looked at her website a long time ago but er at that time she was offering so little in the way of rent</u>
<u n="52" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0282">that it just wasn't feasible for her to take her proposal any further than <unclear/></u>
<u n="54" who="S0645">well if if unless if it was er drastically increased from the old stream of emails that I read through the twenty K mark we'll only get her basically the erm times on the days and and slots that she wants so she could have a similar thing to Krav Maga four evenings a week and a Saturday</u>
<u n="55" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="56" who="S0645">for that for that price</u>
<u n="57" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0645">and she's still going to be quite a little bit under what we would've been able to achieve with other people</u>
<u n="59" who="S0282">well er I think she's come when I mean I think I told her that twenty thousand wasn't gonna do it</u>
<u n="60" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0282">so hopefully she's</u>
<u n="62" who="S0645" trans="overlap">that was for exclusive use though on a lease wasn't it?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0282">er yes she was looking to lease a space</u>
<u n="64" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0282">erm and she said to me it wasn't that wasn't affordable at the time but we had that conversation about money so if it turns out that erm she comes back er she has come back to me which means that theoretically she's got more money than she did before</u>
<u n="66" who="S0645">mm cos if I just work out say fifteen hours a week three five erm five three-hour slots erm <pause dur="short"/> fifteen times call it fifty is seven hundred and fifty hours times forty-five pound the lowest rate that's still thirty-three thousand</u>
<u n="67" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0645">which is basically we're only in</u>
<u n="69" who="S0282">but er but then how much is Krav Maga paying again?</u>
<u n="70" who="S0645">thirty-six that's what I mean I wouldn't be able to <trunc>d</trunc> I wouldn't do it for less that thirty-six quid thirty-six quid an hour is ridiculous</u>
<u n="71" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0645">and that's only because they've got the the vast majority of er the business coming from them so I mean if we did it that way then seven hundred and fifty hours over the course of a year at thirty-six quid that's still twenty-seven grand</u>
<u n="73" who="S0282">yeah so we're looking for thirty for a shared use basically <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="74" who="S0645">yeah yeah <unclear>they'd be both happy</unclear> with thirty to give her the hours that she wants</u>
<u n="75" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0645">of of around fifteen hours a week maybe a little bit more give or take but I need to be able to rent it out for the lion's share of the days Monday through Friday nine till five <unclear/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0282">yeah then if we're if we set ourselves a target for how much we want to earn off the space a year</u>
<u n="78" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0282">then we can work <unclear/> from that as well</u>
<u n="80" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0282">so if the target is to turn sixty grand a year off the space then if she pays <trunc>twen</trunc> if she pays a third of that that's probably enough</u>
<u n="82" who="S0645">mm I I wouldn't wanna give her that <trunc>th</trunc>that prime slot for a third she would have to be paying at least forty percent for a prime slot cos that's where we make money</u>
<u n="83" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah but but that's the only <trunc>pers</trunc> she that's the only that's the only enquiry of that nature that we've had for a while <unclear/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0645">oh yeah if it were something to start from it'd be alright</u>
<u n="85" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0645">but what you've gotta bear in mind is that the slot where I make up the rest of the money the fifty-five pound an hour into the sixty-five pound an hour tariff is the one that she's taking up a lion's share of the hours from</u>
<u n="87" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0645">so it diminishes all possibility of being able to get an a bump up of of money I mean I wouldn't be able to get many more churches and stuff in which is also good money at the weekend</u>
<u n="89" who="S0282">yeah but then on the other hand we must bear in mind that all of these people are erm temporary fixtures if we give them a space we don't have to give them a space forever so say for example if <trunc>s</trunc> if Krav Maga or something we should probably have all of these these er on a on a on a contract on a term contract</u>
<u n="90" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0282">so that we give them six months or we give them a year and it's renewable after that time so we er you know we don't want to mess people about and and throw them out and have them on the streets but quite frankly they they they will up sticks as we know they will up sticks and disappear from one week to the next</u>
<u n="92" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0282">if it suits them so therefore we should have contracts with them that allow us to say look I'm sorry we've changed our minds this is not working for us</u>
<u n="94" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0282">and and erm er and you know please review terminate and go away by extent which is the end of your term contract with us so rather than being arbitrary with people we we we do sort of say to them look this is for six months this is for a year and then at the end of the year we reserve the right to renegotiate</u>
<u n="96" who="S0645">well the main set-up with erm the erm hall bookings more specifically Krav Maga at the minute they're on a recurring contract where we can stop them just as as easy as they can stop us</u>
<u n="97" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0645">but the understanding I've got with them is that his price is based on a is he's been given a price for the next year so next April May sort of time we'll have to go through and renegotiate his his tariff that he's on cos it will have to go up a little bit</u>
<u n="99" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0645">but then we could look at doing that and go right okay I'm gonna put your money up but I will give the security of a twelve-month fix so <unclear/></u>
<u n="101" who="S0282">yeah I mean the thing is that if you I mean it's like renting a flat it's like anything or renting a room or whatever erm you you have a starting price and then other people can put it up</u>
<u n="102" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0282">at will really the only way to not have that kind of thing happen to you is have a formal lease</u>
<u n="104" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0282">you know whereby you commit to quite a big long period of time yourself so that you know you're both tied in to</u>
<u n="106" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="107" who="S0282">the deal the rent is set on one side the term is set on the other side and then that both gives you advantages and then perhaps you that that's when you know you've got your <trunc>p</trunc>your price <unclear/> but if you want to have casual use and you want to be able to pull out when you need to</u>
<u n="108" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="109" who="S0282">and you want to be able to disappear between one day and the next you have to accept that your landlord might want to put your rent up between one day and the next</u>
<u n="110" who="S0645">yeah well what I was thinking about for this space</u>
<u n="111" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0645">going back to that is basically giving it over to people like <anon type="place"/> for this sort of erm this er <trunc>un</trunc> <vocal desc="misc"/> erm the dismantling of the erm town hall sort of thing</u>
<u n="113" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0645">and people needing it and saying to them</u>
<u n="115" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0645">look okay for nine months of the year I can guarantee you can get a Monday Tuesday and a Wednesday</u>
<u n="117" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0645">and I will hold it free</u>
<u n="119" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0645">but then for three months of the year I will give nobody erm preference over say <anon type="place"/> and the casting companies cos if I hold the space empty for them for a week we earn <trunc>t</trunc> double and triple the amount from other people so we could look at it as that</u>
<u n="121" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah er well yeah but except for the fact that actually what we worked out in the past was you can't ride those two horses at once if <anon type="place"/> if <anon type="place"/> come come along they want the whole week and then want it back so so you can't have</u>
<u n="122" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah but but it's it's a season</u>
<u n="123" who="S0645">er you can't have <anon type="place"/> on in there er</u>
<u n="124" who="S0282">no no but you have to work it for a season you wouldn't actually do it <trunc>w</trunc> you wouldn't put somebody like <anon type="place"/> in there because they want to be in there throughout the year you'd have the seasons in so that's what I mean so for nine months of the year it could be available Monday to Friday but for the Christmas season sort of November through January it's it's not</u>
<u n="125" who="S0282">yeah I <trunc>d</trunc> well I would I would be very cautious about that because we <trunc>tr</trunc> we had we had a period of about two years when we had people like <anon type="place"/> coming back periodically and they came back less and less and less</u>
<u n="126" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0282">and when you look back at our schedules they used to be here you know they used to be here for ten weeks twenty weeks or something like that out of fifty-two</u>
<u n="128" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0282">and then gradually gradually it cut cut cut down and we were holding it free for them in case they came back and then they they just went off and they used somebody else's hall instead and actually the weird thing about that particular company is the scabbier the space</u>
<u n="130" who="S0645">yeah the more they like it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="131" who="S0282" trans="overlap">the more they rent it I mean the the more we did up the space the less they took it on it was very bizarre I mean it was it you know who?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0282">I can't well I don't know they just I don't know whether they're really grungy old hippy types and they really liked it being sort of scabby and dirty and everything made them feel like they were at home in downtown <anon type="place"/> and this was really grungy</u>
<u n="134" who="S0645">yeah <unclear>right</unclear> that's why they came here yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0645">erm well <trunc>d</trunc> it's not set in stone but we can do anything with the space but if we do make it I would like to keep it open more of a sort of overflow from downstairs try and not replicate what I've got downstairs cos what I've got downstairs now is an unsaleable sort of space one or two days a week I want it more fluid than that</u>
<u n="137" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0645">and try and transplant stuff up and down you know</u>
<u n="139" who="S0282">yeah although on the other hand we're not actually doing any or much active marketing at the moment so</u>
<u n="140" who="S0645">er there's no point at the minute</u>
<u n="141" who="S0282"><unclear>but</unclear> well I mean it is difficult we are going to have to rely on somebody coming along who wants a Monday</u>
<u n="142" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0282">or who wants a Friday or something like that and it has to be those days because that's all we've got I mean like you know the town hall people it strikes me are going to be one of our best options on that because we <trunc>c</trunc> you know they can probably adapt their schedules to a certain extent so that they <trunc>h</trunc> they do have things on a Monday because you know as long as they can have every Monday for a year or two years or something like that that's fine for them it's just they don't want irregular patterns of of of availability</u>
<u n="144" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0282">they want you know they want us to commit to particular dates particular times but it it is always going to be difficult because er and there's always going to be slots that can't that can't be filled and and and if and we decided to do this thing that we were discussing the other night of being a themed some sort of themed building where we go for say religious uses or educational uses that's gonna actually make it worse</u>
<u n="146" who="S0645">that'll make it really difficult won't it?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0282" trans="overlap">because somebody somebody will come along and say can I have it on a Monday? and say well are you educational?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0645">no</u>
<u n="149" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no so okay do we accept the money? or do we stick out for an educational project that is gonna have it full time?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0645">I think we try we try the theme thing but with always the <unclear>underlining</unclear> sort of er <trunc>d</trunc>decision that we need to take the money</u>
<u n="151" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0645">that comes through the door sort of thing we don't turn money away but if we've got a choice of two people we may we may take slightly less profit or maybe even at break even for some some hours to choose to go in the field that we want to be in but we need to actually pay the bills first we're not in a position of luxury that we can just turn away money</u>
<u n="153" who="S0282">no no absolutely no I know that better than anybody actually but I mean what we're coming back <trunc>ha</trunc> actually erm somebody like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you know so what if the whole of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s project moved in?</u>
<u n="154" who="S0645">mm mm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0282">and took up the whole of this suite of offices for example that's that's a possibility that we actually you know we have had those strokes of luck before</u>
<u n="156" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0282">and you know we've we've marketed small spaces to small organisations but if there is a distinct possibility that somebody might take the whole <unclear/> or somebody might take the whole all of these offices</u>
<u n="158" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0282">and they might want it as a as a single thing or as a big room and and that is always erm <vocal desc="misc"/> I haven't renewed our marketing on the property website for a very long time but that is a distinct possibility that we can let out to a bigger organisation who wants more space</u>
<u n="160" who="S0645">mm if we're gonna do that I think we do that with the central area of the hub we actually put some proper decent online marketing on with the property people to say that there is a <trunc>c</trunc> there is a space up for grabs of a certain size de de de de de</u>
<u n="161" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0645">can be configured into <trunc>d</trunc></u>
<u n="163" who="S0282"><unclear>right</unclear></u>
<u n="164" who="S0645">this that or the other</u>
<u n="165" who="S0282">the only trouble with most estate agents is they take fifteen percent of the first year's rent as their fee</u>
<u n="166" who="S0645">mm well erm</u>
<u n="167" who="S0282">and I've <unclear>walked at</unclear> that before because that's you know that's actually a sort of eye-watering amount of money <unclear/></u>
<u n="168" who="S0645">yeah it is a lot of money I think what we should be doing then and this is what I've sort of tried to say right from the beginning is to get that space configured by a new person coming in we just aim for break even for the first year cos it's been a year now if not more where we've not made a single penny from it if you look at it per seat there is that central area it's not made any money</u>
<u n="169" who="S0282">well</u>
<u n="170" who="S0645">if we had a year of break even</u>
<u n="171" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah but ah ah except for the fact that actually one thing I need to do erm is to talk to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> about what kind of financial contribution he is gonna make to this organisation his <unclear>reuse of that facility</unclear> because it has actually been in use and it's been in use <unclear/></u>
<u n="172" who="S0645" trans="overlap">yeah just</u>
<u n="173" who="S0282">and it's been in use by <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0645" trans="overlap">well the central area yeah for <unclear/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0282" trans="overlap">neither of them have contributed a single red cent to that space</u>
<u n="176" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="177" who="S0282">and you know what I was thinking about <anon type="place"/> the other day was that you know actually they are real liberty takers because they have the space for free they lean on us to give us this space because they're you know how you know we're we're being like we're just not being nice to them by not letting them have the space they don't pay anything for it and then they leave it in a mess</u>
<u n="178" who="S0645" trans="overlap">well no in the evening they have paid it's just been a ridiculously small figure that is just not worth us doing for the amount of hassle so I sent them that email the other day anyway saying it's <trunc>g</trunc> about to be changed and it's no longer gonna be available as of today so er there'll be no more hiring the space out and the the furniture from Ikea is down there ready to be put up</u>
<u n="179" who="S0282">ah I forgot to ask about that</u>
<u n="180" who="S0645" trans="overlap">but it came last week but I'm still waiting for the erm email via Germany suppliers erm</u>

<u n="184" who="S0645"><unclear>for a pair</unclear> <unclear/> so at the minute it's still a case of we don't know whether we can do it cos we don't know whether you got mark one or mark two furniture well of course of course they do they must know that erm but anyway that's er another <unclear/></u>
<u n="185" who="S0282" trans="overlap"><trunc>h</trunc>have you did they copy you in on the emails to Germany?</u>
<u n="186" who="S0645">no he's waiting for the suppliers to get back to him <unclear/></u>
<u n="187" who="S0282">cos I bet you any money at all if you emailed the suppliers direct you'd get a you'd get a better response and a quicker response than via <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="188" who="S0645"><unclear>right</unclear></u>
<u n="189" who="S0282">do you know who made it?</u>

<u n="196" who="S0645">well I'll prompt him again tomorrow cos that'll have been a week again then erm and just see what he says cos as far as I'm concerned we need to know about the legs</u>
<u n="197" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="198" who="S0645">we've we've gotta have the legs otherwise there's no point in <trunc>d</trunc> having that furniture <unclear/></u>

<u n="210" who="S0645">er yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0282">because erm you know I need to know whether they're structural and if so what are they holding up? because erm we're thinking about renovating the space and we need to know you know which bits we can get rid of and which bits we can't</u>
<u n="212" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="213" who="S0282">and we feel that this is probably work that you did as part of your your renovations so</u>
<u n="214" who="S0645">well I would've thought it would be a simple answer for er an architect whether it was him or not because he'll know what they are</u>
<u n="215" who="S0282">oh you know what he well he's very obsessive about this building anyway</u>
<u n="216" who="S0645"><unclear>yeah</unclear></u>

<u n="228" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="229" who="S0282">when I was taking the stuff off it was coming off in really little shaves</u>
<u n="230" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="231" who="S0282">and it was quite pungent and it was er going in my eyes and up my nose <unclear/></u>
<u n="232" who="S0645">yeah there's some quite erm thingy there's some quite crazy wood that you get for doing stuff like that with</u>
<u n="233" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="234" who="S0645">it's not the kind of stuff that you'd use in normal carpentry though erm right so after I've spoke to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> we can speak or look at going to a flooring company</u>
<u n="235" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="236" who="S0645">and looking at the differ things because if we can agree on two different things er two different products to go on the floor that will then give us an idea of what the spend it gonna be once I've spoke to sort of I dunno a a <trunc>r</trunc>rubbish clearance company or something like that</u>
<u n="237" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="238" who="S0645">or a general builder or something because getting the rubbish down the waste from these down will be a job</u>
<u n="239" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="240" who="S0645">I don't wanna do it through the building if we can possibly avoid it</u>
<u n="241" who="S0282">it would be nice if we could have a shute</u>
<u n="242" who="S0645">you can have a shute but that'll need scaffolding</u>
<u n="243" who="S0282">really?</u>
<u n="244" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="245" who="S0282">okay well scaffolding's not that dear</u>
<u n="246" who="S0645">no but it's just <unclear>where would it go</unclear>?</u>
<u n="247" who="S0282" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="248" who="S0645">it would it would only be a single storey it wouldn't be like a man scaffold unit</u>
<u n="249" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="250" who="S0645">it would be just be scaffolding and rigging</u>
<u n="251" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="252" who="S0645">to attach a thingy erm a shute a rubber shute to the to the erm <vocal desc="misc"/> what's it called?</u>
<u n="253" who="S0282">parapet</u>
<u n="254" who="S0645">parapet on that <trunc>ex</trunc> on that corner of the roof there</u>
<u n="255" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0645">and everything could go out there</u>
<u n="257" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="258" who="S0645">it'd just be putting everything up which is easy enough</u>
<u n="259" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="260" who="S0645">erm and that'd be the main cost I think erm in addition to the flooring</u>
<u n="261" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="262" who="S0645">cos that'd be I dunno a couple of days rather than about a week and a half</u>
<u n="263" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="264" who="S0645">to get rid of the crap then erm and I think that would be the only big cost the rest of it would just be stuff that I could do with a couple of <trunc>lo</trunc>local tradesmen the painter that I've got the chippy that I've got could do it all as far as I'm aware erm I mean there's nothing else that couldn't be done wouldn't need any other building firms <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s guys could come in and reset the electrics that are on the wall cos everything's surface mounted it's easy enough I'll just undo all that break it down it's it's not hard erm</u>
<u n="265" who="S0282">I thought you'd turned over a new leaf</u>
<u n="266" who="S0645"><unclear>no</unclear></u>
<u n="267" who="S0282">I thought you had gone beyond all this stuff now that you weren't</u>
<u n="268" who="S0645">no I don't want to do it every day like I was doing it once a week around the building but something big like this would be alright to do cos it would be an achievement rather than the rest of it's just like the Forth Bridge</u>
<u n="269" who="S0282">I know</u>
<u n="270" who="S0645">just constantly doing stuff and then having to redo it so</u>
<u n="271" who="S0282"><unclear>I know</unclear> you're gonna end up really possessive like don't touch my space</u>
<u n="272" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="273" who="S0645">no it'll be alright</u>
<u n="274" who="S0282">that's my space <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="275" who="S0645">it'd be it'd be good to convert it into something that's used cos at the minute er it's just not being used</u>
<u n="276" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="277" who="S0645">it's kind of dead area really and <trunc>ev</trunc>even though it's turning over a very small amount of money with no hassle at all there's no knocking on doors to get rent from this side it's just it's not</u>
<u n="278" who="S0282">and what and how do you feel where's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> up to?</u>
<u n="279" who="S0645">I don't know I would have to speak to her basically and see what she says whether she'd consider it</u>
<u n="280" who="S0282" trans="overlap">is there any moaning and groaning about the facilities lately?</u>
<u n="281" who="S0645">er no not as much not as much but then there's not been <unclear>much</unclear> any conversation at all really so if I <unclear>ever have</unclear> a conversation I avoid <unclear/> erm</u>
<u n="282" who="S0282">are they using the toilets down in the hub?</u>
<u n="283" who="S0645">erm I'm not too sure I have no idea I haven't seen them in there</u>
<u n="284" who="S0282"><unclear/></u>
<u n="285" who="S0645"><unclear/> definitely <unclear/></u>
<u n="286" who="S0282">oh right no cos I was just wondering the sort of the complaint about students going in there might be cos that little spindly one was going in there</u>
<u n="287" who="S0645">no no no no no it's definitely not them I watched a full day of CCTV footage</u>
<u n="288" who="S0282"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="289" who="S0645">er to check and no there isn't erm</u>
<u n="290" who="S0282">much less interesting than it used to be I dare say</u>
<u n="291" who="S0645">yeah definitely erm <pause dur="short"/> no as far as I'm aware it would be a case of kicking out <anon type="place"/> and offering them that</u>
<u n="292" who="S0282"><unclear>right</unclear></u>
<u n="293" who="S0645">cos that would be the only option as it stands at the minute considering I've just given <unclear>accountant as you go</unclear> who is still yet to move in like a sort of a nod that he's got at least eighteen months if not permanent</u>
<u n="294" who="S0282">oh yeah</u>
<u n="295" who="S0645">so I don't wanna dislodge anybody that's not permanent ongoing</u>
<u n="296" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="297" who="S0645">I mean the way <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> goes on every other time you speak to him he could be gone at the er sort of drop of a hat really I mean if his funding <unclear>doesn't pick up</unclear></u>
<u n="298" who="S0282" trans="overlap"><unclear/> carry him out with his fingernails still embedded in the doorframe <unclear/></u>
<u n="299" who="S0645">yeah so as far as I'm aware there's nobody down that end of the <unclear/> <trunc>dow</trunc>down that end of the building that's showing any sort of er inclination that they're gonna move soon so it would have to be a case of kicking somebody out in addition <unclear/></u>
<u n="300" who="S0282">what about the <anon type="place"/> people?</u>
<u n="301" who="S0645"><anon type="place"/> may come or go but they wouldn't take that space</u>
<u n="302" who="S0282">what space?</u>
<u n="303" who="S0645">the <anon type="place"/> space</u>
<u n="304" who="S0282">no <unclear/></u>
<u n="305" who="S0645">no they wouldn't they may use it <unclear/></u>
<u n="306" who="S0282">well not as a storage area they could have that <unclear/></u>
<u n="307" who="S0645">yeah but apparently it's not a storage apparently it's a kitchen and sort of staff room which is never used so it's just a case of it would be it would literally be an option of you've got two in this side I can offer you one down there or you can go sort of thing</u>
<u n="308" who="S0282">they do like two offices they've always had two offices</u>
<u n="309" who="S0645">yeah I I I fully understand that and if if they want them that's fine they're paying for em but to to move them rehome them wouldn't be an option unless we built an extra one in this end here and gave them that one and <anon type="place"/> sort of thing bang opposite each other cos having two <trunc>dis</trunc>disjointed ones wouldn't be an option</u>
<u n="310" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="311" who="S0645">I don't think</u>
<u n="312" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="313" who="S0645">they wouldn't have that at all</u>
<u n="314" who="S0282">no no no no they'd want it right close to each other but are they <trunc>re</trunc>really never in there?</u>
<u n="315" who="S0645">never in there never at all that I'm aware of obviously I'm not down there that much but <unclear/></u>
<u n="316" who="S0282">they have their microwave in there and their lunch and make coffee though don't they?</u>
<u n="317" who="S0645">yeah well yeah that's something that they could put in their space though</u>
<u n="318" who="S0282" trans="overlap">perhaps erm perhaps <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> doesn't like them having food and drink round the tapes and the post and stuff I mean it would be you <trunc>ca</trunc> they can't really send out envelopes to people with sort of sticky paws all over em</u>
<u n="319" who="S0645"><vocal desc="laugh"/> no</u>
<u n="320" who="S0282">where someone's been eating their kebab over the</u>
<u n="321" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="322" who="S0282">packet</u>
<u n="323" who="S0645">well erm it's it's obviously it's something that they do need but</u>
<u n="324" who="S0282">please can you send me a new CD? cos I dropped my lunch on the last one</u>
<u n="325" who="S0645"><unclear>mm yeah but</unclear> erm it's something that I just wouldn't be able to offer em as it stands at the minute</u>
<u n="326" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="327" who="S0645">without creating something but that would literally be the only other thing really erm the meeting room I think we could sort of erm we could get by again with using one of the other spaces down the other end like you say about moving the the partition wall further into the kitchen</u>
<u n="328" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="329" who="S0645">and that'd create a space that's <trunc>eas</trunc>easily big enough for a meeting room or erm we've always got the hub the hub is always gonna be</u>
<u n="330" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="331" who="S0645">sort of available I mean obviously the meetings would have to be pushed on a little bit <unclear>but I could say to them</unclear> <unclear/></u>
<u n="332" who="S0282">no well I mean the thing is about having this room it's about having access A us having access to the roof whenever we need it and not having to knock on doors because er we've seen as with the people in the crypt you say we need permanent access to the electricity room and the gas room</u>
<u n="333" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="334" who="S0282">er and the the plant and everything and then you have to argue with them to get a bloody key and then and then er before you turn round they've changed the locks so you have to get another key</u>
<u n="335" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="336" who="S0282">and then there's an instance they ask for the key back et cetera when this er there was a set of people who were in this office for a really long period of time getting in this office to get on the roof was the a right royal pain cos you could never get in</u>
<u n="337" who="S0645" trans="overlap">well if this was on</u>
<u n="338" who="S0282">and then secondly then as soon as we got as soon as they left and got in we discovered that they had been they had got deck chairs out there they were lying sunbathing on the roof all the tiles were broken where they'd been clambering all over the roof</u>
<u n="339" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="340" who="S0282">and getting up there and god knows what they'd been up to out there it was just er you know you have to honestly save people they've got to have the keys to the door so you can't stop them going out there and the next minute they're scrambling all over the roof like they're</u>
<u n="341" who="S0645">mm well the point of having this as an open space would make it very easy to get access to the bell tower door and that roof door</u>
<u n="342" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="343" who="S0645">because you just say to people that I dunno say we had <unclear/> in here at the same time as the people going on the roof just say to em today you can either not have your session or you could have a little bit of interruption with comings and goings from the roof it's not in use all the time it's more of an emergency access and when we do need access to it it's planned</u>
<u n="344" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="345" who="S0645">I mean I'm the only person that goes out there without planning it cos I don't have to tell people what I'm doing</u>
<u n="346" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0645"><unclear>you know</unclear></u>
<u n="348" who="S0282">by the way have you done a <unclear>gutter pass</unclear>?</u>
<u n="349" who="S0645">I've checked er it's on a reminder on the phone yeah er <trunc>ev</trunc>every fortnight I go out there and check em at the minute they're alright</u>
<u n="350" who="S0282">oh good and how many dead pigeons are out there?</u>
<u n="351" who="S0645">erm there's less than normal I think</u>
<u n="352" who="S0282" trans="overlap">actually the other thing to put on the list on our maintenance list for next year is to have that netting <trunc>s</trunc> having someone sorting out that netting again because</u>
<u n="353" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="354" who="S0282">those watching those pigeons dying of hunger gradually and then dropping off bit by bit is disgusting and they're getting in somewhere the stupid twits well how they can I don't know why they can get in and not out did you say they can only fly upwards or something? or downwards or something? was there somebody saying about pigeons they they can't fly in every direction?</u>
<u n="355" who="S0645">I don't know I don't think they can fly backwards <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="356" who="S0282">but then they can get in they sort of walk along the ledge <unclear/> and they can't they can't remember how to get back out again</u>
<u n="357" who="S0645" trans="overlap">I think I think they just sort of yeah I think they're crawling in there from one of the other sides and then they're not using their brain to know that they've walked in they can walk out and they're panicking they're trying to flap out and not coming out er</u>
<u n="358" who="S0282">yeah they've only got a brain the size of a pea</u>
<u n="359" who="S0645">yeah but they're also <unclear>the thing is</unclear> they're also putting their nests up there so I think some of them are actually being born on the ledge</u>
<u n="360" who="S0282"><vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="361" who="S0645">and being in and out of it and then obviously they get big one day and they can't fit through the hole any more so but I dunno I <trunc>d</trunc> I think it's just</u>
<u n="362" who="S0282">mm and did you say that somebody's got a hawk <unclear/> or something? we could have a hawk</u>

<u n="448" who="S0645">it's crap laminate but it's good for a base you can lay on the top of it</u>
<u n="449" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="450" who="S0645">which is then called a floating floor what you're meant to do is have this stuff called erm soundboard which is green sort of medium density sort of like MDF but papery looking</u>
<u n="451" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="452" who="S0645">these boards that go down and you do like a tiled floor of that and then you put laminate on top</u>
<u n="453" who="S0282"><unclear>right</unclear></u>
<u n="454" who="S0645">with erm a foil backing on it that's a proper laminate floor installation</u>
<u n="455" who="S0282">mm</u>

<u n="461" who="S0282">a flooring merchant oh no we had the <anon type="place"/> was it was a flooring workshop and then in the end we just went in there and got the cheapest possible</u>
<u n="462" who="S0645"><vocal desc="cough"/> well to be honest the lino now the final lino flooring that looks like erm oak plank is better than this we had it down downstairs remember? the stuff that I pulled up</u>
<u n="463" who="S0282" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="464" who="S0645">that looks really good compared to this and it lasts longer than the laminate as well if you get any chairs and stuff banging against this too much</u>
<u n="465" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="466" who="S0645">it'll go quickly</u>
<u n="467" who="S0282">no and it's horrible round the edges this sort of er trim that you put round the edges looks really crap</u>
<u n="468" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="469" who="S0282">but erm er yeah I think and also it's I think it's quite nice having a quite a nice bright colour</u>

<u n="474" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="475" who="S0282">then you know it'll come up with a nice buff and it'll look good</u>
<u n="476" who="S0645">and you can see it's been cleaned and er and this stuff just looks <unclear/></u>
<u n="477" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah yeah it does it can you know</u>
<u n="478" who="S0645">mm</u>

<u n="483" who="S0282" trans="overlap">er horrible horrible</u>
<u n="484" who="S0645">erm so going on to spending then as you've probably just overheard with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I've come in under budget on what I was meant to spend on cos I've not done a few jobs they've put a few jobs off mainly by the contractors not coming back to me and also by just prioritising what needs to be done</u>
<u n="485" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="486" who="S0645">er are you happy for me to carry on having <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the painter doing jobbing work and possibly his dad doing a little bit more with the doors and stuff?</u>
<u n="487" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no no that's absolutely fine if you're happy with the quality of their work</u>

<u n="489" who="S0282">they do look a bit er are they they don't look as if they're the sharpest tools in the box those two when you look at them</u>
<u n="490" who="S0645">I don't know they're just <trunc>l</trunc>lads really aren't they? I think they're the kind of people that left school and went straight on to like building sites and stuff you know?</u>
<u n="491" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="492" who="S0645">if his dad's a chippy he's probably done his apprenticeship when he was on his six-week holidays or getting er suspended from secondary school or whatever</u>
<u n="493" who="S0282"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="494" who="S0645">and instead of going to college or whatever he's done that erm</u>
<u n="495" who="S0282">well if you're <trunc>ha</trunc> as long as you're happy with them I mean they won't be a permanent solution cos nobody is but while they while they're good and they're doing good work for us then then that's fine by me I have no problem as long as they're invoicing properly and we're not paying them out of petty cash and stuff like that which is what I really object to</u>
<u n="496" who="S0645" trans="overlap">no well erm petty cash has only been used for materials which it's gotta be and it's just the same as me going up the road and buying it and just coming back with the receipt and done it all properly erm other than that no his his actual wages his hours for a day's work are getting paid by a cheque I've told him that I can get him a cheque really quickly now at the minute</u>
<u n="497" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="498" who="S0645">with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> being in the building</u>
<u n="499" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="500" who="S0645">and also like today if he wants the cheque for a hurry cos he's going on holiday and I'm then going on holiday we can just write him the limit you know</u>
<u n="501" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="502" who="S0645">er so it's all being done above above board and by the book sort of thing</u>
<u n="503" who="S0282">okay that's fine</u>
<u n="504" who="S0645">so I'm gonna carry on with the <unclear>painters and decorators</unclear></u>
<u n="505" who="S0282" trans="overlap">no no I just don't want to be <unclear/> somebody like you ended up with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> where you know he just well anyway</u>
<u n="506" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="507" who="S0282">erm</u>
<u n="508" who="S0645">well to be honest there's not really any need for another general builder at the minute erm speaking to him yesterday he does know somebody that can do installation of vinyl flooring like you know the guy that came from <anon type="place"/> doing the <trunc>hea</trunc>heat laminated flooring</u>
<u n="509" who="S0282" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>

<u n="511" who="S0282">okay</u>
<u n="512" who="S0645">erm and I mean they're doing that now and I've said to him maybe I'll get him in to redo the bathroom erm gents floor and the ladies at some point because the paint's just not standing up to the wee basically</u>
<u n="513" who="S0282">oh really?</u>
<u n="514" who="S0645">yeah it's come off already</u>
<u n="515" who="S0282"><unclear/> already?</u>
<u n="516" who="S0645">yeah if you have a look in the gents in the cubicles and in front of the urinal where you're gonna get piss splashes on the floor it's coming up it is eating away at it</u>
<u n="517" who="S0282" trans="overlap">you're joking</u>
<u n="518" who="S0645">no it's eating away but he said that's because it's water-based paint which is meant to be oil-proof for like in a car er from <trunc>f</trunc> in a garage it's garage floor paint</u>
<u n="519" who="S0282">yeah?</u>
<u n="520" who="S0645">so it's been designed to be oil-proof but you've obviously got erm er well I can't remember what the chemical is in urine</u>
<u n="521" who="S0282">urea</u>
<u n="522" who="S0645">no there's something else it's</u>
<u n="523" who="S0282">ammonia?</u>
<u n="524" who="S0645">yeah ammonia ammonia will break it down because it's erm water-based whereas if it's an oil-based paint ammonia won't break it down</u>
<u n="525" who="S0282">but should should shouldn't he know that?</u>
<u n="526" who="S0645">well he <trunc>d</trunc> he knows that now</u>
<u n="527" who="S0282">but he should well <unclear>yeah I just don't er</unclear> <unclear/></u>
<u n="528" who="S0645">cos er no cos he came to me and said oh I'm really sorry but the floor's lifting I was like no it's alright I've seen it it's not lifting where you've actually done the work where people aren't peeing on it but where they are peeing on it it's coming away so they're peeing on it it's sitting there for a day the cleaner's going in the next day and it's it's taken the colour out of it</u>
<u n="529" who="S0282">by that time it's</u>
<u n="530" who="S0645">yeah it's by that time it's sat on it</u>
<u n="531" who="S0282">so is it visibly horrible?</u>
<u n="532" who="S0645">in patches it's only small patches like that at the minute but yeah it's it's not gonna look good for very long so what I'm saying is what I will get the guy to do is I will get the guy to do a little run a little square with offcuts cos we've said that we might be able to get it on the cheap from his job that he's doing at the minute</u>
<u n="533" who="S0282">oh <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear>right</unclear></u>
<u n="534" who="S0645">from his waste and just do the <trunc>cu</trunc>the the cubicles</u>
<u n="535" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="536" who="S0645">cos that's where it's gonna be worst and then the bit in front of the urinal we can do at a later stage but it's a bit of an issue er</u>
<u n="537" who="S0282">so what would he do? would he kind of he would get cubicle shape</u>
<u n="538" who="S0645" trans="overlap">well he he'll have offcuts</u>
<u n="539" who="S0282" trans="overlap">cubicle-sized offcuts and then what? weld them together with the with the sticky <trunc>s</trunc> with the silicone sticky underneath the underneath the <unclear/></u>
<u n="540" who="S0645" trans="overlap">yeah he <trunc>d</trunc> he said he does it with the strips but I don't think because of the size of the erm the cos of the size of the erm spaces that we're talking about the strips wouldn't be needed for joins the strips would be needed just to sort of join it to the the <trunc>p</trunc> the erm</u>
<u n="541" who="S0282">to the walls</u>
<u n="542" who="S0645">yeah to the walls of the cubicle</u>
<u n="543" who="S0282">oh yeah cos the walls of the cubicles go down to the floor don't they?</u>
<u n="544" who="S0645">yeah yeah they touch</u>
<u n="545" who="S0282">right okay so that's fine so all you need is an oblong of <unclear>whatever and then</unclear></u>
<u n="546" who="S0645" trans="overlap">yeah yeah just about I dunno er I dunno a metre by a metre for each one so he needs four four <trunc>s</trunc>square metres</u>
<u n="547" who="S0282">yeah okay</u>
<u n="548" who="S0645">and which I'm pretty certain they can just write off in a day</u>
<u n="549" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="550" who="S0645">so I'll get him to do that if I can and that will just be a cash job and I'll just make it out that I paid for the materials and they did that themself</u>
<u n="551" who="S0282">okay</u>
<u n="552" who="S0645">erm cos that would be the same</u>
<u n="553" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="554" who="S0645">erm so I'll get that done if I can</u>
<u n="555" who="S0282">well no I think I think that needs to be done as soon as possible cos I think it's</u>
<u n="556" who="S0645">well it's the floor that's made the space look so good</u>
<u n="557" who="S0282">yeah</u>

<u n="561" who="S0282">so is that a child from <anon type="place"/>? or is that er <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="562" who="S0645">it's not a child from <anon type="place"/> it's definitely not a child from <anon type="place"/> cos it's not childish writing it's basically somebody writing <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> in big letters twice in what I would assume is basically someone who's not very cool who thinks they can graffiti it cos it's not done in like your average outdoor graffiti style writing <unclear/></u>

<u n="568" who="S0645">definitely it's either one of them or someone from Krav Maga</u>
<u n="569" who="S0282">oh</u>
<u n="570" who="S0645">but I don't think it's somebody from Krav Maga I <trunc>d</trunc> <vocal desc="misc"/> I don't see why they would go and sit in a cubicle and scrape their name in the wall</u>
<u n="571" who="S0282" trans="overlap">why not?</u>
<u n="572" who="S0645">because they're too busy they're all quite straight bods and they are busy when they're in the building they're not the kind who wants to go and sit in the toilets you know?</u>
<u n="573" who="S0282">so is it sitting height? or standing height?</u>
<u n="574" who="S0645">it's the sitting height <unclear/></u>
<u n="575" who="S0282">really?</u>
<u n="576" who="S0645">yeah so somebody is sat in the toilet bored cos you wouldn't go into the toilet and be busy doing what you're doing and do that you know? it's somebody who's sitting in the toilets bored on their phone and just</u>

<u n="580" who="S0645">well I don't know er</u>
<u n="581" who="S0282">so have you said something to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> about it?</u>
<u n="582" who="S0645" trans="overlap">I don't know whether anybody's seen it it's it's scraped into it with a key or something sharp</u>
<u n="583" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="584" who="S0645">something sharp and thick</u>
<u n="585" who="S0282">it's have you said anything to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> or <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> about it?</u>
<u n="586" who="S0645">no cos the toilets aren't finished yet if the first thing that happens when the toilets are finished I will go and check cos I did check the name against cos it's it's literally <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> so it's like <unclear/></u>
<u n="587" who="S0282">and is there and er is there a <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>?</u>
<u n="588" who="S0645">there's nothing that correlates from the erm student list at the minute but then it could be a nickname I don't know</u>
<u n="589" who="S0282">yeah well you er perhaps you could get erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to go in there with a piece of paper and say I've got a note for <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and see if anybody stands up</u>
<u n="590" who="S0645">there'd there'd be a way of checking but</u>
<u n="591" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="592" who="S0645">like I say once it's finished once it is finished I will be sort of erm more on it than that and I am going to do something I'm going to do like a toilet attendance sheet or something for the guys so when they're meant to be doing their internal chores they can go and check the toilets cos it's starting to annoy me now erm so yeah that'll be something that we'll be doing but anyway I'm gonna carry on getting <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and possibly his dad to carry on doing the cosmetic stuff</u>
<u n="593" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="594" who="S0645">erm the store's pretty much built in the fourth floor he's gotta come back on Monday to finish it cos</u>
<u n="595" who="S0282">oh <unclear>excellent</unclear></u>
<u n="596" who="S0645"><anon type="place"/> the timber that they sell they only sell full sheets and he needs half sheets and if he buys full sheets he's gonna end up with too much waste and considering he's done that at price it's gonna eat into his money that he's getting paid so he's gonna come back Monday and put the lid on it and then <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s gonna paint it it's fine perfectly fine it's actually quite huge erm but it'll be good enough for the Krav Maga guys</u>
<u n="597" who="S0282">and it's <unclear/> looks alright does it?</u>
<u n="598" who="S0645">it'll be fine it's made out of sterling board</u>
<u n="599" who="S0282"><unclear/></u>
<u n="600" who="S0645">it's made out of sterling board and it's it's er to to that <trunc>hei</trunc> single single roof height so basically this height roof</u>
<u n="601" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="602" who="S0645">in the corner so once it's painted it'll look like it's always been there</u>
<u n="603" who="S0282">right yeah</u>
<u n="604" who="S0645">and it'll be fine depending what lock I put on the door will make it look slightly different</u>
<u n="605" who="S0282">okay yeah you don't want anything too industrial looking on it then</u>
<u n="606" who="S0645" trans="overlap">so I'm gonna have a look at the ironmongery on it well I might just put a single erm shackle and erm thingy like on it shackle and padlock like I've got in the kitchen there on it something like that cos it can't have a erm because it's double doors without a post</u>
<u n="607" who="S0282">yes</u>
<u n="608" who="S0645">it can't have a normal lock</u>
<u n="609" who="S0282">no because otherwise people can just push it</u>
<u n="610" who="S0645">yeah <unclear>so I'll have to see</unclear> erm so I'll have to have a look but I'll try and get something that looks nice and neat</u>
<u n="611" who="S0282" trans="overlap"><unclear/> yeah no I mean something that looks a bit more decorative</u>
<u n="612" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="613" who="S0282">and like you know <unclear>has er that's not</unclear></u>
<u n="614" who="S0645">well that's what I mean if I get a <unclear/> like a nice chrome one or something something that doesn't look like it would go outside something that is definitely for inside</u>
<u n="615" who="S0282">oh no that's that little fly is it?</u>
<u n="616" who="S0645">yeah erm</u>
<u n="617" who="S0282">we've only got one little fly haven't we?</u>
<u n="618" who="S0645">yeah I think so yeah</u>
<u n="619" who="S0282"><unclear/></u>
<u n="620" who="S0645">erm something that's definitely for inside rather than outside as well I won't put anything horrible on it but it needs to be something secure enough to make it erm make it that it's got to be broke for someone that wants to get in there that shouldn't be getting in there</u>
<u n="621" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="622" who="S0645">so I'll do something like that erm he's gonna then blank off the two sets of doors that we're no longer using</u>
<u n="623" who="S0282">yeah excellent</u>
<u n="624" who="S0645">so he's got he's got some board to go over those</u>
<u n="625" who="S0282"><unclear>fantastic</unclear></u>
<u n="626" who="S0645">he's just literally gonna blank them</u>
<u n="627" who="S0282"><unclear>fantastic</unclear></u>
<u n="628" who="S0645">erm to the actual doorframe flush fitting so if we ever needed to use them in the future you just</u>
<u n="629" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="630" who="S0645">literally pry the piece of timber out</u>
<u n="631" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="632" who="S0645">so that's easy enough</u>
<u n="633" who="S0282"><unclear/></u>
<u n="634" who="S0645">so I'm gonna maybe get him to do some stuff like that around the place as well erm</u>
<u n="635" who="S0282">oh er yeah no I've got another couple of suggestions</u>
<u n="636" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="637" who="S0282">which is that erm the entrance er somebody commented the other day that the doors into the community hall look really <unclear>raggy</unclear></u>
<u n="638" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="639" who="S0282">and so we <trunc>sh</trunc>we should get a coat of paint on them <unclear/></u>
<u n="640" who="S0645">well that's it that's the the the thing I'm gonna get <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> doing jobbing is basically just starting with things like that</u>
<u n="641" who="S0282">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="642" who="S0645">so all the <trunc>d</trunc> all the all the doors that are unglossed</u>
<u n="643" who="S0282">and that <trunc>corri</trunc> and that and the corridor out there</u>
<u n="644" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="645" who="S0282">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="646" who="S0645">all the doors that are unglossed I'm gonna get him to gloss over</u>
<u n="647" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="648" who="S0645">and fix up anything like the pane of glass that's in it I might get that removed</u>
<u n="649" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="650" who="S0645">or just taken out or whatever whatever's easy erm then if there's anything that is not matching like we've got the brown stuff that like level two to three it went brown for a time</u>
<u n="651" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="652" who="S0645">I want all that doing and the blue <unclear/> all blue uniform erm and then if there's any jobs for his dad to do carpentry-wise</u>
<u n="653" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="654" who="S0645">I'll get him to come and do those</u>
<u n="655" who="S0282">and also the door into the ladies loo has got has peeled</u>
<u n="656" who="S0645">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="657" who="S0282">cos it's a laminate door <unclear>on the two ladies</unclear> <unclear/></u>
<u n="658" who="S0645">well that just needs a coat of paint <unclear/> a coat of paint really for the time being <unclear/></u>
<u n="659" who="S0282">yeah although there's a bit that I sort of could pull at this morning</u>
<u n="660" who="S0645">right okay</u>
<u n="661" who="S0282">where er there's er just a little there's just a little strip of</u>
<u n="662" who="S0645">well if you just cut it just take more off it and cut it so it's square that'll be fine then <unclear/></u>
<u n="663" who="S0282" trans="overlap">mm mm but yeah it does I mean the ladies looks immensely better already</u>
<u n="664" who="S0645">well just yeah the coat of paint that went in on there the other day has made it lifted</u>
<u n="665" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah yeah it's er yeah absolutely hugely better</u>
<u n="666" who="S0645" trans="overlap">yeah totally lifted it mm</u>
<u n="667" who="S0282">and then also wherever there's a coat of paint and it's looking <unclear/> that's looking good that corridor in the the original and the actual existing cupboard and it'd be really nice to kind of lighten the colour of those so that corridor as you go into the community hall is lighter as well</u>
<u n="668" who="S0645">the the sort of yeah the the the old chill out space?</u>
<u n="669" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="670" who="S0645">well I need a light in there</u>
<u n="671" who="S0282">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="672" who="S0645">but at the minute we've got issues with the with the electrics the electrics are still throwing up problems erm</u>
<u n="673" who="S0282">oh</u>
<u n="674" who="S0645">with regards to the erm circuit boards that are in there the circuit board that's in there <anon type="place"/> came down the other day this is obviously <unclear>mass</unclear> doing it themselves</u>
<u n="675" who="S0282">yes</u>
<u n="676" who="S0645">basically the circuit board that's in there the breakers that they've got are not sold by any electrical wholesaler the only place that still sells them is B and Q so it's basically it's <trunc>con</trunc> it's it's trade electronics at retail level</u>
<u n="677" who="S0282">well it's yeah it's no it's</u>
<u n="678" who="S0645">so</u>
<u n="679" who="S0282">er it's <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> or <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who were <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s right-hand men</u>
<u n="680" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="681" who="S0282">doing a bit of their <pause dur="short"/> their er you know impromptu electrics that they were doing all over the building all the time and you know they took they took a lighting spur off the</u>
<u n="682" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="683" who="S0282">off the fire system in the cleaner's cupboard and stuff like that they were always sort of <trunc>w</trunc> er why how come they never got killed themselves or anything I really really don't know <pause dur="short"/> they were just they were <trunc>m</trunc> they were absolute maniacs and they were always you got it?</u>
<u n="684" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="685" who="S0282"><vocal desc="laugh"/> erm and so there are places all over the building where I mean all that rigging and all those lights the lights and you know people saying things are latched on with bits of string</u>
<u n="686" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="687" who="S0282">and stuff like that that's all them that's their handiwork they were just honestly erm er it's a miracle that this building is still standing up quite frankly and we haven't had a fire so yes they would've done they would've messed around with the boards in there</u>
<u n="688" who="S0645">mm well erm as far as I'm aware</u>
<u n="689" who="S0282" trans="overlap">and where are the boards for that bit?</u>
<u n="690" who="S0645"><trunc>th</trunc>they're both in that space</u>
<u n="691" who="S0282">oh are they?</u>
<u n="692" who="S0645">one to the right one to the left</u>
<u n="693" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="694" who="S0645">the one to the left we've had the community space light switches for the new uplighters and the ceiling lights removed so if you look at the blank door that we used to use into that space</u>
<u n="695" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="696" who="S0645">on the wall there there are now three socket three switches one's a blank switch which is gonna be an emergency light I think</u>
<u n="697" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="698" who="S0645">at some point in the future</u>
<u n="699" who="S0282">mm</u>
<u n="700" who="S0645">one is the hall lights and one is the ceiling lights so nothing on that board which has now got the Krav Maga storage unit built around it needs to be accessed on a daily basis</u>
<u n="701" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="702" who="S0645">erm the the <trunc>s</trunc> the fuse board to the right controls weird stuff like bits of the ladies toilets and the erm cleaning cupboard erm</u>
<u n="703" who="S0282" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="704" who="S0645">I don't know what else it controls but basically that's the board that needs to be made safe</u>
<u n="705" who="S0282">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="706" who="S0645">there needs to be more breakers going in it</u>
<u n="707" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="708" who="S0645">erm the gents toilet controls are literally on one switch in the board that's now got the Krav Maga store built around it so that's there nothing in there needs to be accessed on a daily basis</u>
<u n="709" who="S0282">no</u>
<u n="710" who="S0645">erm yeah we've er we're getting to the bottom of it what I will have by the end of this <anon type="place"/> remedial works being done is a full map of everything like that</u>
<u n="711" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="712" who="S0645">so I'll be able to refer to a piece of paper and say right that's controlled from there</u>
<u n="713" who="S0282">yeah okay well we had that before but yes it obviously needs updating cos we've done <unclear/></u>
<u n="714" who="S0645" trans="overlap">yeah well things have been moved and split now boards have been erm yeah boards have been broken down</u>
<u n="715" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah <unclear/> <trunc>an</trunc>and also the other thing that I was gonna say is that erm now that our community hall is not used for a nightclub or any other mass entertainment thing</u>
<u n="716" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="717" who="S0282">we don't need those two wide fire escapes down to the front doors of the portico so only one of the fire escapes needs to be a fire escape the other one doesn't need to be a fire escape anymore and quite frankly when we have the peace garden</u>
<u n="718" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="719" who="S0282">we might need to use one of those spaces as a kind of storage space or something for gardening equipment the one the one that only goes up to the back of the fourth not erm you know the one there's the one that serves sixth</u>
<u n="720" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="721" who="S0282">which is outside <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s office</u>
<u n="722" who="S0645">that's the right-hand side one</u>
<u n="723" who="S0282">that's the right-hand side one and that goes from top to bottom</u>
<u n="724" who="S0645" trans="overlap">yeah if you're in the community space</u>
<u n="725" who="S0282">so that serves</u>
<u n="726" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="727" who="S0282"><trunc>u</trunc>us up here</u>
<u n="728" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="729" who="S0282">and the fourth floor</u>
<u n="730" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="731" who="S0282">and <anon type="place"/> the one on the other side that only comes up to the fourth floor</u>
<u n="732" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="733" who="S0282">we could reuse that and make that into er you know I know it's got stairs and er it's not <unclear/></u>
<u n="734" who="S0645">well no it's it's it's got three full landings on it</u>
<u n="735" who="S0282">yeah and there's space at the bottom</u>
<u n="736" who="S0645">but the church have gotta use it the church have gotta use that on er at first floor above ground</u>
<u n="737" who="S0282"><unclear>right</unclear></u>
<u n="738" who="S0645">cos it is theirs cos it's it's their second fire escape there's two fire escapes there's a mirror of fire escapes on the <unclear/></u>
<u n="739" who="S0282">yes yes <unclear>I know</unclear> they've got four fire escapes haven't they?</u>
<u n="740" who="S0645">yeah they've got two down below that</u>
<u n="741" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="742" who="S0645">but if they've got them they need to be able to use them</u>
<u n="743" who="S0282">no no but then we take it out of service cos they can it's no longer a fire escape and get them to take the light off the exit</u>
<u n="744" who="S0645">oh right okay yeah yeah</u>
<u n="745" who="S0282">we say okay when you're on the mezzanine and your level you can either go to the right</u>
<u n="746" who="S0645" trans="overlap">there's a fire exit to the right <unclear/> down</u>
<u n="747" who="S0282">to get out the front of the building or you can go to the back and onto the central staircase so you've still got three fire exits at <trunc>mez</trunc>mezzanine level</u>
<u n="748" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="749" who="S0282">but erm or <trunc>t</trunc> or is it two? but you shouldn't have there shouldn't be that many people on the mezzanine that there's a crush to get out and that people will need a metre wide sort of exit so I would've thought that cutting one of those stopping it being a fire exit would be and then also all we need to do then is sort of blank off the glass so that when you come in through the through their front entrance into their space they can't see that there's a storage space on the other side</u>
<u n="750" who="S0645">mm mm</u>
<u n="751" who="S0282">so that you know? but erm but then that could also be another storage area at some point you know if we want er or actually if we wanted to reverse the building and have the gardening stuff at the back of the building</u>
<u n="752" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="753" who="S0282">up the back fire escapes we could then make the front fire escape a storage space</u>
<u n="754" who="S0645">mm but you can't go right the way <unclear>up</unclear> the building through the back fire escape cos it only goes to <unclear/></u>
<u n="755" who="S0282">yeah no no no I know no no no I what I'm talking about is you know the space where <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has got the last of his stuff</u>
<u n="756" who="S0645">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="757" who="S0282">under the back stairs</u>
<u n="758" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="759" who="S0282">so those storage spaces where we've got two churches</u>
<u n="760" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="761" who="S0282"><unclear>and you know under those back stairs</unclear>?</u>
<u n="762" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="763" who="S0282">those storage <trunc>spa</trunc> you could reverse it out so that you've got storage spaces at the front so the people who've got storage at the back behind the hub</u>
<u n="764" who="S0645">yeah well that'd mean that they didn't need any access from us then basically</u>
<u n="765" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="766" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="767" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="768" who="S0645">yeah cos they'd just come out and go through the inner doors of the church reception or church foyer but</u>
<u n="769" who="S0282" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="770" who="S0645">yeah okay <unclear>well that's fine</unclear> <unclear/></u>
<u n="771" who="S0282">so actually yes the landing outside the back of <anon type="place"/> on the mezzanine level</u>
<u n="772" who="S0645">could be their storage</u>
<u n="773" who="S0282">that that could be their storage area</u>
<u n="774" who="S0645">they wouldn't pay us for that though <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="775" who="S0282"><unclear>why not</unclear>?</u>
<u n="776" who="S0645">we're we're only making five hundred quid a year anyway it's just it's not even here nor there erm</u>
<u n="777" who="S0282">mind you if they'd have to take it down the spiral stairs then wouldn't they? they wouldn't be pleased about that</u>
<u n="778" who="S0645">no cos they could us the big stairs in front of them no? just use the inner door of the foyer</u>
<u n="779" who="S0282">yes I suppose so</u>

<u n="791" who="S0282">yep</u>
<u n="792" who="S0645">so he doesn't have to go into the office saying please leave all voicemails on the mobile</u>
<u n="793" who="S0282">yeah</u>

<u n="798" who="S0645">mm I <trunc>d</trunc>I don't think there's any need for it to be on all the time he's just gonna get pointless enquiries that he's not gonna be able to answer while he's working <unclear/></u>
<u n="799" who="S0282">no no no but it's about answering the phone though it is about answering the phone <trunc>peop</trunc> when somebody rings up somebody answers the phone and you don't have somebody saying oh I'll come back to you in you know next week or something</u>
<u n="800" who="S0645" trans="overlap">okay <unclear/> office</u>

<u n="803" who="S0282">yeah but I mean even if you just <trunc>che</trunc> even if whoever's there just checks it twice a day or something</u>
<u n="804" who="S0645">mm</u>
<u n="805" who="S0282">or answers it when they can or are just aware that it's rung and that there's an enquiry then I think that you know somebody picks up the phone and says oh sorry <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s on holiday do you need can you leave it till he gets back or do I need to do something now? so that at least we know you know cos there was that glitch that time when erm when you couldn't get hold of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> for example</u>
<u n="806" who="S0645">yeah</u>
<u n="807" who="S0282">and I can see that sort of situation turning up where somebody sort of says somebody phones up and says oh help help there's something urgent and there's nobody at the other end listening to the message oh yes cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had left the phone at work so when you were phoning him up saying where are you?</u>
<u n="808" who="S0645">yeah</u>

<u n="870" who="S0645">for the guys erm I'm gonna give <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> a rough estimate of what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s gonna do to year end he's then gonna give me a figure that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is owed in holiday hours</u>
<u n="871" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="872" who="S0645">I've told <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> that he's got to use it all in January</u>
<u n="873" who="S0282">right</u>
<u n="874" who="S0645">so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is okay to use his holiday in January but for business erm purposes only because it suits us</u>
<u n="875" who="S0282">oh er okay well I mean have you talk have you talked have you talked to him about what he wants to do?</u>
<u n="876" who="S0645" trans="overlap">erm how do you feel about him cashing any of it in? he doesn't wanna <unclear/> work he doesn't want any holiday he doesn't want time off</u>
<u n="877" who="S0282">ah you see there's er something you didn't have holiday and then he went sick</u>
<u n="878" who="S0645">no but he's got a <trunc>d</trunc> erm he wants to go back on his own shift rotation</u>
<u n="879" who="S0282">yeah</u>

<u n="881" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="882" who="S0645">but he doesn't want any more time off than he's got</u>
<u n="883" who="S0282">how many days has he will he have by the end of December?</u>
<u n="884" who="S0645">I don't know I would estimate that he's probably got er he's been here what? two or three months two two months yeah he'll probably have about three to four weeks I reckon</u>
<u n="885" who="S0282">what? he's not taken any holiday?</u>
<u n="886" who="S0645">no he's not had any holiday no</u>
<u n="887" who="S0282">oh christ</u>
<u n="888" who="S0645">he's just done loads of days straight as well so what I'm suggesting is if he's got four weeks coming</u>
<u n="889" who="S0282">yeah</u>
<u n="890" who="S0645">that we let him use half of it and let him cash half of it in</u>
<u n="891" who="S0282">yeah no I think that's a good compromise actually that gives him a nice bonus and it says thank you to him for working so hard and then we should also give it to him at Christmas so that he's got something</u>
<u n="892" who="S0645">okay</u>
<u n="893" who="S0282">nice for Christmas I think yeah so</u>
<u n="894" who="S0645" trans="overlap">right all holiday to use in Jan fifty percent cash-in available</u>
<u n="895" who="S0282">yeah yeah cos otherwise well I mean who knows what's gonna happen in January you know the er I mean</u>
<u n="896" who="S0645"><unclear/></u>
<u n="897" who="S0282">it'll be just be our luck if he goes off on a month's holiday and and then <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> gets a sore throat or something <unclear/></u>
<u n="898" who="S0645">well what I've gotta</u>
<u n="899" who="S0282">oh when's his when's his baby due?</u>

<u n="947" who="S0282">er well er er actually before you do that though talk to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> about when his baby's due because</u>
<u n="948" who="S0645">oh yeah that's <unclear/></u>
<u n="949" who="S0282">it it might be it might be sensible to say to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you've got to use it by Easter if it looks like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> might have to rush up to <anon type="place"/> in January</u>
<u n="950" who="S0645">yeah</u>

<u n="955" who="S0282">okay okay</u>
<u n="956" who="S0645">I think</u>
<u n="957" who="S0282">alright but then perhaps <trunc>w</trunc> perhaps you can give erm perhaps you can give <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> till Easter or something to use it up I don't approve of this this is actually it does say in his contract use it or lose it <unclear/></u>
<u n="958" who="S0645">it does say it but I'm not gonna enforce it to the point of like giving him grief because it's his first time here and he's just done us a favour</u>
<u n="959" who="S0282">well the thing is yes he has only just joined here and we've worked him really hard and we <trunc>ma</trunc>we made him work a month without stopping essentially cos of <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s holiday</u>
<u n="960" who="S0645">yeah</u>
