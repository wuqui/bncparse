<u n="43" who="S0058">no it's still</u>
<u n="44" who="S0026">you don't have to boil it again <pause dur="short"/> it's still hot though</u>
<u n="45" who="S0120">if there's water in it</u>
<u n="46" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's water</u>

<u n="48" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0120">sorry</u>
<u n="50" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="51" who="S0058">it's a habit from work because</u>
<u n="52" who="S0120">I am a grateful guest <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="53" who="S0058">if you just <trunc>ha</trunc> if you just boil enough for one another three people will arrive</u>
<u n="54" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0058">while you're standing waiting for it to to go <pause dur="short"/> I'm just gonna turn the sausages over <pause dur="short"/> they smell done <pause dur="short"/> grilling <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="56" who="S0026">when I  when I  went to er</u>
<u n="57" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they're done</u>
<u n="58" who="S0026">I had  I had  an interview at TTP</u>
<u n="59" who="S0058">oh right</u>
<u n="60" who="S0026">um last year <pause dur="short"/> and we ended up talking about kettles</u>
<u n="61" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="62" who="S0026">um</u>
<u n="63" who="S0058">bit random</u>
<u n="64" who="S0026">and I think it was the reason that they didn't <trunc>o</trunc> they didn't offer me a job was the way I responded to this conversation about kettles</u>
<u n="65" who="S0058">oh god</u>
<u n="66" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="67" who="S0026">um <pause dur="short"/> cos they're very into like the engineers not just being engineers but also being very good at business</u>
<u n="68" who="S0058">okay</u>
<u n="69" who="S0026">and like sale or that's the impression I get is like <trunc>ac</trunc> actual selling and stuff as well</u>
<u n="70" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="71" who="S0026">um and I hadn't realized that <pause dur="short"/> um so we we got <trunc>h</trunc> I can't remember whether they asked me about kettles or whether they said something like can you give me an example of something that you think you could improve on? Like an <trunc>e</trunc> day-to-day object or whatever</u>
<u n="72" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0026">I think that's what it was actually <pause dur="short"/> cos I I was quite annoyed at the time <pause dur="short"/> I'd just realized that kettles are all crap <pause dur="short"/> you <trunc>d</trunc></u>
<u n="74" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="75" who="S0026">you boil water and then it <trunc>nor</trunc> they normally sit there boiling it for about five to ten <trunc>t</trunc> seconds</u>
<u n="76" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0058">before yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0026">when they don't need to do that <pause dur="short"/> if they just get to boiling and then instantly turn off</u>
<u n="79" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0026">so you don't need boiling water for tea anyway <pause dur="short"/> you want it to be slightly off boiling</u>
<u n="81" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="82" who="S0026">or whatever <pause dur="short"/> so I said  I said  that <pause dur="short"/> I said well this is a day to day object that actually</u>
<u n="83" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0026">really annoys me <pause dur="short"/> and the guy said so what do you think the reason is that um that no kettle will instantly turn off as soon as it boils? Cos he goes</u>
<u n="85" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0026">the technology's there surely? Well I mean he didn't didn't say that and I</u>
<u n="87" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0026">I think I said that</u>
<u n="89" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0026">I was well like surely it's <trunc>r</trunc> it's really easy</u>
<u n="91" who="S0058">huh</u>
<u n="92" who="S0026">I mean you</u>
<u n="93" who="S0058">ridiculous</u>
<u n="94" who="S0026">must be able to fairly easily just like get a decent thermocouple that</u>
<u n="95" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0026">tells it when to turn off <pause dur="short"/> and the answer he was looking for was that it's just too expensive <pause dur="short"/> cos you <trunc>w</trunc> people want a kettle that's cheap <pause dur="short"/> they don't wanna spend money</u>
<u n="97" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0026">on</u>
<u n="99" who="S0058">on a kettle</u>
<u n="100" who="S0026">a kettle</u>
<u n="101" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0026">and I didn't come out with that</u>
<u n="103" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="104" who="S0026">um <pause dur="short"/> and cos they want their engineers to be very good at like you know <trunc>obvio</trunc> like obvious business decisions</u>
<u n="105" who="S0058">business <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0026">and stuff</u>
<u n="107" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0026">and that's that's so simple <pause dur="short"/> like I mean even I would've thought of that if I'd really kind of twigged <pause dur="short"/> but for some reason I didn't come out with it like well I don't really know <pause dur="short"/> cos I mean it must be fairly straightforward to make a kettle <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="109" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="110" who="S0120">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="112" who="S0026">but one of my colleagues also interviewed there and got rejected <pause dur="short"/> and he cos they you can ask for feedback <pause dur="short"/> they're actually are quite good TTP are like</u>
<u n="113" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="114" who="S0026">giving feedback on on interviews</u>
<u n="115" who="S0058">okay</u>
<u n="116" who="S0026">if you don't get in</u>
<u n="117" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="118" who="S0026">they say don't be afraid to ring up and ask <pause dur="short"/> we're quite happy to</u>
<u n="119" who="S0058">that's really nice <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0026">I mean I <trunc>don</trunc> I don't bother kind of just I was just like I was too busy <pause dur="short"/> I was doing like revision and stuff</u>
<u n="121" who="S0058">yeah sure</u>
<u n="122" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="123" who="S0026">um <pause dur="short"/> but he <trunc>al</trunc> my colleague who um also applied said something like oh they they said so weren't strong enough on the the the businessman side of it <pause dur="short"/> more you were very good on the engineering</u>
<u n="124" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="125" who="S0026">but not on the selling and er sort of</u>
<u n="126" who="S0058">oh that's interesting</u>
<u n="127" who="S0026">financial stuff</u>
<u n="128" who="S0120">hm</u>
