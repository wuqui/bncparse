<u n="823" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="824" who="S0517">so there were five courses so and as it turned out there was like one long table in the room that you sort of go into there was comfy chairs in it so that's the room where you sit when you first arrive and have a drink and then there was another room that people were going through to to just sit and have lunch but we didn't go through to that we stayed in this room and it was like a high er a high table with sort of high chairs and and I think it said on the website the maximum they would have would be eight but <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and I were the only two sat there don't know whether you do it like all together I don't know but we were the only two sat there so we had five courses and each course was brought out by a different chef I mean considering they we asked them there was like thirty-five people in for lunch and erm and us and then she said they had eleven chefs on <pause dur="short"/> eleven chefs that day there was at least six people front of house the service was absolutely fantastic</u>

<u n="828" who="S0517" trans="overlap">there was erm oh I can't remember what they all were now it was a few weeks ago there was a couple of different things but you were using your your fingers to eat this first bit and then he said and then now I'll show you what these are and he got this jug of hot water and he poured it over what I thought were mints and they just grew and they turned out to be serviettes it was incredible to watch they just grew and these you know like the hot serviettes they give you in a Chinese restaurant?</u>
<u n="829" who="S0558" trans="overlap">oh wow</u>
<u n="830" who="S0517">yeah and they were were rolled up really tightly so we had those for afterwards erm and then we had we had oh one was beef and octopus but this octopus had been done for five hours in red wine it was so nice but like I say every the presentation was unbelievable one of them was <trunc>ev</trunc> was something that was like beetroot mousse well I don't like beetroot and I thought I'm not gonna like this one came out didn't really look anything like you'd expect I tasted it it was delicious and I'm thinking I don't even like beetroot it was lovely but the er the dessert oh we had lamb slow roast lamb my goodness</u>
<u n="831" who="S0558" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="832" who="S0517">you just literally put your knife in it just fell apart with PH tomatoes they called them but there was different coloured tomatoes and one had been done in like er honey and lemon and one had been done in something else they were everything was so excuse me</u>

<u n="834" who="S0517" trans="overlap">so nice and we had this absolutely fantastic dessert and then at the end there there was it was called chocky <pause dur="short"/> mint chocky it was called so again they brought out this glass bowl with like a hole in and something at the bottom wasn't really sure what and on the top of it it just looked like dead twigs to be honest it <trunc>di</trunc> it didn't look at all appetising and I thought what is that? literally just looked like a dead twig erm but they said no no that's not edible don't panic so <trunc>th</trunc> then another chef came out and he gave us our it was like a a chocolaty minty mousse thing he said and then <trunc>th</trunc>this is what this is and he poured this water onto this thing and it was dry ice at the bottom so the whole but the and the twig was dried mint I hadn't realised so the whole whole table's covered in this dry ice and he had this really strong <trunc>s</trunc> aroma of mint as you were eating your chocolate mint he said it's just you know a a little touch we do</u>

<u n="2731" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="2732" who="S0517">I mean to be honest we've got such cos we're cos of being on the corner</u>
<u n="2733" who="S0558" trans="overlap">there's plenty of room</u>
<u n="2734" who="S0517">there's plenty of room and where people park literally outside our front door</u>
<u n="2735" who="S0558">yeah</u>
<u n="2736" who="S0517">doesn't affect any traffic because</u>

<u n="2738" who="S0517">it's so wide there and it's on this side</u>
<u n="2739" who="S0558" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2740" who="S0517">it doesn't affect any traffic whereas if you were parked you know you know just before you get to our drive by the trees if you were parked there</u>
<u n="2741" who="S0558" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="2742" who="S0517">that I think that's a difficult one because people would have to come out to go round it and if somebody was coming that way to turn into <anon type="place"/> road</u>
<u n="2743" who="S0558" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="2744" who="S0517">that would be to park there would be a hazard whereas if you park up</u>

<u n="2749" who="S0558">yeah it's wide enough isn't it?</u>
<u n="2750" who="S0517" trans="overlap">it's not affecting anybody there</u>
<u n="2751" who="S0558" trans="overlap">no no there's plenty of room</u>
<u n="2752" who="S0517" trans="overlap">but ideally what we have said is we need to get organised so that <pause dur="short"/> one of us can go in the garage</u>
<u n="2753" who="S0558">mm</u>
<u n="2754" who="S0517">and two on the drive and have a rethink before <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> gets to that age</u>
