<u n="81" who="S0084">as an option <pause dur="short"/> cos I've got pasta <pause dur="short"/> I wonder whether I should just get stuff to go with pasta and then <trunc>r</trunc> no one has to get takeaway cos otherwise that'll just cost loads of money doesn't it <pause dur="short"/> and at least if I get pasta I'll cook some sort of vegetable in the fridge</u>
<u n="82" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="83" who="S0084">but with the pasta <pause dur="short"/> I've got a pasata sauce but that's not very exciting</u>
<u n="84" who="S0041">mm</u>

<u n="447" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> really I would just leave her to it</u>

<u n="460" who="S0084" trans="overlap">she'll talk to you when she's ready</u>
<u n="461" who="S0046">mm</u>
<u n="462" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> the worst thing you could do is to try and chase chase information out of her</u>
<u n="463" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="464" who="S0041">but when she comes to you just listen to her and don't don't forget about it <pause dur="short"/> cos I think boys have a tendency to <trunc>for</trunc> when something like that happens to move on much quickly than she'll move on about it</u>
<u n="465" who="S0046">mm</u>
<u n="466" who="S0041">and so maybe a few months down the line</u>
<u n="467" who="S0046">mm</u>
<u n="468" who="S0041">it might upset her and she'll be really angry that you don't understand that she could still be hurt by it</u>

<u n="487" who="S0046">well that's if she stays in <pause dur="short"/> you know she's er she's kind she kind of feels obligated to go out</u>
<u n="488" who="S0041">I'd tell her to stay at home if it was me</u>
<u n="489" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="490" who="S0046">but if I tell her to stay at home she's gonna think well why does he want me to stay at home <pause dur="short"/> so I'm just gonna make her make</u>
<u n="491" who="S0041" trans="overlap">no she'll <pause dur="short"/> if what she's saying is true <pause dur="short"/> if she's been honest with you about this actually happening <pause dur="short"/> and I know that's an awful thing to say but I've known some crazy girls that have said they're pregnant when they weren't actually pregnant in the first place</u>
<u n="492" who="S0046" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> well yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know so have I</u>
<u n="493" who="S0041">but hypothetically if this is true there is no way she wants to go out tomorrow <pause dur="short"/> none <pause dur="short"/> I promise you</u>
<u n="494" who="S0046">yeah</u>
<u n="495" who="S0041">and any get out of jail free card she's gonna take it like full <pause dur="short"/> there's no way she's gonna wanna see anybody <pause dur="short"/> none</u>
<u n="496" who="S0046" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> hmm mm <pause dur="short"/> yep right yeah <pause dur="short"/> cool <pause dur="short"/> I need a</u>

<u n="500" who="S0084">um a cow on a stick?</u>
<u n="501" who="S0041">A cow on a stick <pause dur="short"/> a burger Vegas <pause dur="short"/> he went anyway she was like the whole time <pause dur="short"/> she must have been</u>
<u n="502" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> I'm sorry <pause dur="short"/> if you've only been together a month <pause dur="short"/> a it was ridiculous even saying she'd been pregnant with him at the time</u>
<u n="503" who="S0041">yep yep yep yep</u>
<u n="504" who="S0084">all that's happened is she's had her period <pause dur="short"/> so it's not that it's <trunc>im</trunc> it's just impossible to have anything</u>
<u n="505" who="S0041" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> she she was on her period <pause dur="short"/> we were waiting for her period to have finished for a good amount of time <pause dur="short"/> so that this Saturday could take the second doctor styley this is the decider test this week so <pause dur="short"/> she only was on on her period last week</u>
<u n="506" who="S0084">but then how can you be pregnant?</u>

<u n="508" who="S0084">she's a miracle <pause dur="short"/> she is <trunc>a</trunc> actually you know</u>
<u n="509" who="S0041">I think the way she's described it to him <pause dur="short"/> she was on her period <pause dur="short"/> last week she thought she was basically off it and so could take a test <pause dur="short"/> which came ninety percent positive but she said that could still show positive because of hormones in your body when you're on your period and I've only just come off mine so we'll wait a little bit longer to take a a proper stance with this doctor styley <pause dur="short"/> it was complete bollocks</u>
<u n="510" who="S0084">what it er I mean I've heard about there being spotting you know in the early days of pregnancy which is why some women don't realise they're pregnant for months</u>
<u n="511" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="512" who="S0084">but actually having a period when you think that you're pregnant is completely ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> there is absolutely no way you can be pregnant if you're having a period <pause dur="short"/> surely <pause dur="short"/> everything's getting flushed out</u>
<u n="513" who="S0041" trans="overlap">well she's yeah she's saying that the her last period was two weeks ago <pause dur="short"/> but when she did the test last week she was scared that the reading wasn't really truthful because she'd only just come off her period</u>
<u n="514" who="S0084">nope that's bollocks <pause dur="short"/> absolutely bollocks</u>
<u n="515" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="516" who="S0084">there's just no way that you can be pregnant in that amount of time <pause dur="short"/> he's a fucking moron clearly for believing her</u>

<u n="518" who="S0084">she's a fucking weirdo</u>
<u n="519" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="520" who="S0084">it's just like</u>
<u n="521" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> how could ya? How could ya?</u>
<u n="522" who="S0084">you can't and it's in that amount of time there's no way <pause dur="short"/> absolutely no way <pause dur="short"/> all that's happened is she's now not only has she been lying about the baby because there's no possible way there could be a baby</u>
<u n="523" who="S0041">no how could you possibly</u>
<u n="524" who="S0084">there's absolutely physically no way <pause dur="short"/> go and speak to a fucking GP</u>
<u n="525" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="526" who="S0084">and there's no way you could possibly be pregnant in that  in that  amount of time <pause dur="short"/> all that's happened is she's had another period</u>
<u n="527" who="S0041">I sound bad but I wanna say to him how does the how could you explain to me how she's explained this to you cos I don't really get the chronological order of this</u>
<u n="528" who="S0084">no right well there isn't <pause dur="short"/> she's just basically <unclear/> off</u>
<u n="529" who="S0041">like she's taking the piss out of him bad</u>
<u n="530" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and then and now the worst thing of all to say I've lost the baby</u>
<u n="531" who="S0041" trans="overlap">to throw that on him</u>
<u n="532" who="S0084">there's but there was no fucking baby <pause dur="short"/> she's had her period</u>
<u n="533" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="534" who="S0084">and to see him <pause dur="short"/> I mean obviously he's fucking mental but he's actually upset about the whole thing because he thinks she is</u>
<u n="535" who="S0041" trans="overlap">I know <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="536" who="S0084">what's happened is she's probably a bit upset that she's not pregnant</u>
<u n="537" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> she was just never pregnant</u>
<u n="538" who="S0084" trans="overlap">she's not lost anything</u>
<u n="539" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="540" who="S0084">she's comparing herself to the trauma of some other woman having to lose a child</u>

<u n="542" who="S0084">which you can't even imagine how bad that must be</u>
<u n="543" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="544" who="S0084">I think she's disgusting <pause dur="short"/> she's playing him for a fool for a start</u>
<u n="545" who="S0041">isn't she</u>
<u n="546" who="S0084">Cos she's <trunc>prob</trunc> she's probably mental</u>
<u n="547" who="S0041" trans="overlap">that's why I want to sit down <pause dur="short"/> I want to say to him okay can you explain this to me cos I can't understand the order of it and played on</u>
<u n="548" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="549" who="S0041">for him to see it <pause dur="short"/> cos that's that's I can not imagine anybody what type of person would use that?</u>
