<u n="1" who="S0008"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> saw the packages when he was supposed to sort them out</u>
<u n="2" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="3" who="S0008">and er there'd be <pause dur="short"/> perhaps about thirty-odd pack in a trolley or something</u>
<u n="4" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="5" who="S0008">and then you know we started about eight o'clock and then at midnight the midnight train would come in and we'd have to unload some more trolleys <pause dur="short"/> you know depending it could be about another ten or twenty or thirty even sometimes</u>
<u n="6" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0008">and er we're suppose to spend all night <pause dur="short"/> sorting out these trolleys right? well we'd get in there at eight <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> there'd only about two of us there three of us and we start sorting these trolleys out and this guy he was he wasn't the boss but he was sort of like the big brash bloke telling everyone what to do</u>
<u n="8" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0008">we used to have this sort of rule that you weren't allowed to do more than twelve twelve trolleys</u>
<u n="10" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="11" who="S0008">then we used to stop by which time it was about ten o'clock and then we'd <pause dur="short"/> kip down for a couple of hours till the train come in</u>
<u n="12" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0008">and then we'd unload them trolleys <pause dur="short"/> just stash them away then we'd kip down for another couple of hours</u>
<u n="14" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0008">and then <pause dur="short"/> well then we had to go upstairs after that and you know an hour before we went cos I used to get a lot of catalogues and things</u>
<u n="16" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0008">cos there was two big erm <pause dur="short"/> you know sort of er what do you call them? these <pause dur="short"/> ah catalogue houses</u>
<u n="18" who="S0012">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0008">you know and they used to ship out all these thousands of catalogues</u>
<u n="20" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's right yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0008">and we had to put them into the areas where we went to and then bind them up into bundles and there were always <trunc>thous</trunc> stacks and stacks of these things to go out but we'd only do it about <pause dur="short"/> you know an hour or less and then we'd go home <unclear>at night</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> you could easily clear the whole bloody lot</u>
<u n="22" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="23" who="S0008">you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="24" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0008" trans="overlap">could easily have done if you worked right through</u>
<u n="26" who="S0012">that's terrible innit?</u>
<u n="27" who="S0008">but these people <pause dur="short"/> these you know these blokes who work there for years <pause dur="short"/> they had to cos you had to register what you'd done</u>
<u n="28" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0008">and they didn't want to let it be known that it was possible for to do everything</u>
<u n="30" who="S0012" trans="overlap">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0008">otherwise they'd say oh how come this day suddenly</u>
<u n="32" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0008">you'd done all this whereas before you'd only been doing so much of a day?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0008"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and you know er <pause dur="short"/> we used to go there just sort of like turn out with a sleeping bag</u>
<u n="36" who="S0013"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0008">really cos you know</u>
<u n="38" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah I went one when I used to work at <anon type="place"/> there were we had the time and motion people come around</u>
<u n="39" who="S0008">oh yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0012">cos I was working on the caps and lags and and setting them all up and doing and er the foreman come up he says look it takes a minute and a half to do one of those cogs or whatever I was taking a minute and a half okay? <pause dur="short"/> don't do it under a minute and a half otherwise you've spoilt the whole lot for us</u>
<u n="41" who="S0008"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="42" who="S0012">righto then and you have to do it by hand you see</u>
<u n="43" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0012">and it was so boring taking your time like that you know</u>
<u n="45" who="S0008" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="46" who="S0012">and getting your coppers out and getting the <pause dur="short"/> motor motor <trunc>ski</trunc> <unclear/></u>
<u n="47" who="S0008" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="48" who="S0012">out and measuring that <pause dur="short"/> and then <unclear/> and then taking a bit off with a little bit of emery paper and measuring up again you know and you've got to get to a tenth of a thou <pause dur="short"/> which was quite easy to do</u>
<u n="49" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="50" who="S0012">you know it was and the time and motion bloke would be there like that you <pause dur="short"/> and you'd get the nod from the foreman down there right and then you'd finish off the <pause dur="short"/> minute forty-five you took there's somebody had taken a minute and a half <trunc>otherwi</trunc> to most people said oh I'm sorry you know they said okay he says you so the time's time is still a minute and half but you could do them <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="nonsense"/> literally like that</u>
<u n="51" who="S0008" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0012">literally in about thirty seconds</u>
<u n="53" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/> that don't go on nowadays they can't do it nowadays cos it's all automated <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="55" who="S0008">well exactly and like when you think about what you were doing there that's like outta the ark innit?</u>
<u n="56" who="S0012">that's outta the ark yeah yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0008">and now you get these automated <pause dur="short"/> laser cut machine</u>
<u n="58" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0008">and they just like spit them out dum dum dum dum and they're all every one is more accurate than you could do if you spent a month on it</u>
<u n="60" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I I used to work on the caps these automatic caps at <anon type="place"/> engineering and er knocking these things out I mean once you set them up they knock them out and knock them out and knock them out and you're there at two o'clock in the morning thinking oh Christ there's no you know all you have to do is go and check every now and then and see it that's right</u>
<u n="61" who="S0008" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0012">and so well I've probably told you the story before I got so fed up with it I just went round and switched all the machines off</u>
<u n="63" who="S0008"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="64" who="S0012">and the bloke says what are you doing? I said I'm now going home you can't go home what about us? I says well you can look after it yourself I'm off <pause dur="short"/> and I never went back to engineering again I I thought this is not going to be my life</u>
<u n="65" who="S0008" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="66" who="S0012">for the rest of my life I'm not doing this I can't <pause dur="short"/> I mean <pause dur="short"/> and now it must be even worse cos they're so <trunc>automa</trunc>mated and there's hardly anyone there now</u>
<u n="67" who="S0008">all you gotta do now read a blueprint and feed the</u>
<u n="68" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0008">the readings into the into the machine</u>
<u n="70" who="S0012" trans="overlap">into the <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="71" who="S0008">and that's all done on remote computers and</u>
<u n="72" who="S0012">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="73" who="S0008">probably you don't even need to read you just copy the blueprint into the machine and that reads itself</u>
<u n="74" who="S0012">you needn't be an engineer anymore need you?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0008">well no <pause dur="short"/> well this is it you don't have to be an engineer</u>
<u n="76" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="77" who="S0008">the only engineers now are in erm <pause dur="short"/> stuff like research and development I reckon</u>
<u n="78" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0008">where you get so many <pause dur="short"/> you know individual stuff that you have to make yourself</u>
<u n="80" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah you have to make yeah that's true yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0008">or in stuff like</u>
<u n="82" who="S0012">tool making</u>
<u n="83" who="S0008">tool making robot making</u>
<u n="84" who="S0012">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0008" trans="overlap">all this sort of stuff</u>
<u n="86" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="87" who="S0008">where it's all <trunc>slo</trunc> you know individual stuff</u>
<u n="88" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean someone got to make tools that the robots use to do the job and</u>
<u n="89" who="S0008" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's right</u>
<u n="90" who="S0012">and somebody got to make the robots and stuff like that</u>
<u n="91" who="S0008">but there again you've got these <pause dur="short"/> you can make</u>
<u n="92" who="S0012" trans="overlap">robots make robots</u>
<u n="93" who="S0008">in another <pause dur="short"/> another few years when you get 3D metal printing</u>
<u n="94" who="S0012">god yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0008">you know we're going there it ain't gonna be long</u>
<u n="96" who="S0012">it ain't gonna be long is it?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0008">and you won't need anyone to do anything with you</u>
<u n="98" who="S0012">it's a <unclear/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0008">all you need is a designer just to make the picture</u>
<u n="100" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0008">a 3D picture</u>
<u n="102" who="S0012">that's it yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0008">and that'll be it</u>
<u n="104" who="S0012">I mean they <pause dur="short"/> they can make plastic guns now can't they?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0012">with plastic bullets too</u>
<u n="107" who="S0008">well no they fire real bullets I think</u>
<u n="108" who="S0012">well they can fire real bullets but they make because they they were talking about this on on on one of the programmes I was watching making these plastic bullets is as easy as making a a real bullet</u>
<u n="109" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0012">but the only thing they can see in the X-ray is the <unclear/> date inside</u>
<u n="111" who="S0008" trans="overlap">oh right <pause dur="short"/> so even the cases are plastic?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> everything is plastic</u>
<u n="113" who="S0008">yeah well they reckon that they can print ready-to-use mobile phones</u>
<u n="114" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0008">or they will be</u>
<u n="116" who="S0012">it will yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0008">or <unclear/> probably they already can well that's something innit? you know where you can you know like printed circuits will be actually printed circuits <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="118" who="S0012">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="119" who="S0008">you know</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="120" who="S0012">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> dear I mean what's what's going to happen in another twenty years? I mean</u>
<u n="121" who="S0008">god I dunno it'll either be really fantastic or horrendous</u>
<u n="122" who="S0012">well in the in the sixties when I was out to work <pause dur="short"/> they used to say that very soon there'll be so much spare time there'll be nobody at work</u>
<u n="123" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0012">well that didn't work out in the sixties</u>
<u n="125" who="S0008" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> now you've got more people working in Britain than there ever has been</u>
<u n="126" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah ever before yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0008">yeah maybe cos <pause dur="short"/> all the women are working whereas before at least fifty percent of them used to be quite happy to</u>
<u n="128" who="S0012">stay at home yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0008">stay at home and raise a family</u>
<u n="130" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0008">then the blokes could earn enough to keep them</u>
<u n="132" who="S0012">to keep them going yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0008">keep them going well it's that's the main difference I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't mind <pause dur="short"/> one or the other of them staying at home</u>
<u n="134" who="S0012">well that's right</u>
<u n="135" who="S0008">but you can't afford to now</u>
<u n="136" who="S0012">no you <trunc>ca</trunc> you can't cos erm I tell you when my mum and dad bought their house in nineteen thirty-nine just before the war <pause dur="short"/> it was three hundred and eighteen pounds</u>
<u n="137" who="S0008">mm mm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0012">right? <pause dur="short"/> now he was on something like nine pound a week at the time</u>
<u n="139" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0012">I don't know what what's that? that's supposed to be a third third of your wages innit? your mortgage?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0008">I don't know but anyway yeah but <trunc>in</trunc> the thing is in <trunc>tho</trunc> well no before the war <pause dur="short"/> it was quite tricky to get a a loan wasn't it?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0012">it was <trunc>ti</trunc>tricky to get a loan yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0008">but the proportion like ten pound a week versus three hundred quid is a lot smaller than it is now though isn't it?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0012">that is yeah yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="145" who="S0008"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="146" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0008">you know but it's funny that you know the the <pause dur="short"/> the banks are very <pause dur="short"/> they won't <trunc>loa</trunc> lend to</u>
<u n="148" who="S0012">well every <trunc>ga</trunc> everyone down our little road all owned their own house</u>
<u n="149" who="S0008">well that was quite unusual though <unclear/></u>
<u n="150" who="S0012" trans="overlap">that was quite unusual yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> everybody</u>
<u n="151" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0012">which is really weird when you think about that I don't know how I know that Provident man used to come around every every week so</u>
<u n="153" who="S0008" trans="overlap">well were they new houses or?</u>
<u n="154" who="S0012">brand new built by <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="n"/></u>
<u n="155" who="S0008">yeah well that'd be the difference you see</u>
<u n="156" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0008">that'll be the difference cos they were built to sell</u>
<u n="158" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="159" who="S0008">as opposed I mean people didn't <pause dur="short"/> well I don't know there's there's loads and loads of houses <pause dur="short"/> bought all them terraced houses that were built in the nineteen hundreds I was gonna say they were rented out weren't they?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0012">yeah I expect they were</u>
<u n="161" who="S0008" trans="overlap">that's cos they were owned by the rich people who rented them</u>
<u n="162" who="S0012">yeah well my gran used to live up <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="163" who="S0008">that's where I had a house up <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="164" who="S0012">did you? <anon type="address"/> hers hers her house was</u>
<u n="165" who="S0008" trans="overlap">yeah really? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="166" who="S0012">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> and er <pause dur="short"/> I don't know whether they own it or rented it but they moved from there and bought a house in <anon type="place"/> er er up <anon type="place"/> if that's still alive? <pause dur="short"/> that was a little bungalow up <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> or in <anon type="place"/> that's right <pause dur="short"/> off <anon type="place"/> there's <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> and there and there's a off of <anon type="place"/> there's a little Home Depot across it and then it come down into <anon type="place"/> which is at the bottom of <anon type="place"/> which leads to old <anon type="place"/> don't it? <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/> lead to <anon type="place"/> yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0008" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0012">and they <trunc>bo</trunc> they bought this house there and my aunt <pause dur="short"/> she moved from London er <pause dur="short"/> to <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="place"/> lived up the top of <anon type="place"/> in this little tiny cottage which only had <pause dur="short"/> one bedroom <pause dur="short"/> no loos no bathroom <pause dur="short"/> no water and the loo at the bottom of the garden and she used to <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>ha</trunc>have er <pause dur="short"/> a water pipe outside</u>
<u n="169" who="S0008">mm mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0012">where they used to go and get the water <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="171" who="S0008">whereabouts is it?</u>
<u n="172" who="S0012">this was up <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="173" who="S0008">right</u>
<u n="174" who="S0012">right up the top of <anon type="place"/> I think that'll go <trunc>ro</trunc> all the way through now now it's all I reckon that little house has been bulldozed pulled down and something else has been put</u>
<u n="175" who="S0008" trans="overlap">oh I'm sure it has yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0012">but er I used to go when I was an apprentice I used to bike from from <pause dur="short"/> er <anon type="place"/> where where I used to work at the  bottom along <unclear/> all the way up to <anon type="place"/> and go and have my dinner at my aunt's</u>
<u n="177" who="S0008"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="468" who="S0012">it'd still take twenty</u>
<u n="469" who="S0008">a hundred <trunc>thou</trunc> no wait hundred thousand pound is a hundred pound a week so a thousand pound is a pound a week no it's more isn't it?</u>
<u n="470" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="471" who="S0008">so seven hundred pound for a pound a week seems like a bargain <pause dur="short"/> if you got the spare cash</u>

<u n="476" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="477" who="S0008">you can buy an annuity <pause dur="short"/> which pays you five thousand a year for the rest of your life however long you live</u>

<u n="483" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="484" who="S0008">so a hundred thousand pound is paying buying you a hundred pound a week</u>

<u n="486" who="S0008">so it's a thousand pound is buying you a pound a week</u>
<u n="487" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="488" who="S0008">that is the standard rate which <pause dur="short"/> is going so if you're offered a thing seven hundred quid for a pound a week that's a bargain</u>
<u n="489" who="S0012">but that depends</u>
<u n="490" who="S0008">but you see what happened is is that you're paying them seven hundred quid</u>
<u n="491" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="492" who="S0008">and the government was putting in the extra three hundred quid innit?</u>
<u n="493" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="494" who="S0008">and you're getting a pound a week but that's taxable</u>
<u n="495" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="496" who="S0013">I'm getting an extra fifty-two pound a year</u>

<u n="506" who="S0012">yeah you got</u>
<u n="507" who="S0008" trans="overlap">well it's you know fourteen years is only seventy-four I mean you're you know if you live to be if you're sixty you're expecting to live to be well over eighty now aren't you?</u>
<u n="508" who="S0012">you're right yeah yeah</u>
<u n="509" who="S0008">eighty-five so it is a bit of a bargain</u>
<u n="510" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I suppose it is if you look at it like that yeah</u>
<u n="511" who="S0008">you know it's it's a <trunc>be</trunc> you know I mean this is for people who've got the cash right?</u>
<u n="512" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="513" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="514" who="S0008">I mean you know you get a lot of people who you know they retire and that and what with one thing and other they add up all the cash they got and they got like twenty grand laying about or thirty grand or forty grand or whatever you know <pause dur="short"/> you think well I'll I'll invest that to live off right?</u>
<u n="515" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="516" who="S0008">but you invest seven hundred quid there's no way you're gonna get fifty-two quid a year interest out of that</u>
<u n="517" who="S0012">that's true</u>
<u n="518" who="S0008">is there?</u>
<u n="519" who="S0012">no <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="520" who="S0008">cos you're talking about the interest rates of about eight percent</u>
<u n="521" who="S0013">I see just sounded ridiculous to me</u>
<u n="522" who="S0008">but eight percent I mean nowadays the interest rates you get you know if you put in a building society you're getting one percent if you're lucky</u>
<u n="523" who="S0012">yeah if you're lucky yeah it's point something percent now innit?</u>
<u n="524" who="S0008">so one percent of seven hundred quid is seven quid a year <pause dur="short"/> so you could be getting instead of seven quid a year you could be getting fifty-two quid a year</u>

<u n="530" who="S0012">there is a limit on it yeah</u>
<u n="531" who="S0008">yeah cos if cos obviously for a lot of people with a a private pension pot</u>
<u n="532" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="533" who="S0008">you know they suddenly say oh blooming heck you know if I can get you know <vocal desc="laugh"/> fifty fifty-two quid a year for every seven hundred quid</u>
<u n="534" who="S0012">yeah that's right that's that's that's</u>
<u n="535" who="S0008" trans="overlap">well go for it instead of getting five thousand a year</u>
<u n="536" who="S0012" trans="overlap">that's right look at the</u>
<u n="537" who="S0008" trans="overlap">you're then getting</u>

<u n="539" who="S0008">something like seven or eight thousand</u>
<u n="540" who="S0012">yeah</u>
