<u n="4470" who="S0235">it's it's <unclear/></u>
<u n="4471" who="S0198" trans="overlap">I mean I think it's <event desc="sound of dishes"/> <unclear/> school <pause dur="short"/> it's the behaviour is not that good in Korea you think like the like you say it can't be like they're definitely getting worse and also the parents because they like make the student study so much like ridiculous hours from such a young age that they kind of allow them to behave however they want <event desc="sound of dishes"/> <unclear/> like in general</u>

<u n="5883" who="S0235" trans="overlap">like four twenty-three twenty-four</u>
<u n="5884" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="5885" who="S0236" trans="overlap">and they look more favourably upon it cos you're older</u>

<u n="5887" who="S0235" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="5888" who="S0192">uni because of it</u>
<u n="5889" who="S0236" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="5890" who="S0192">but he completely screwed up his college and his A levels and all that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="5891" who="S0235" trans="overlap">yeah and that's exactly what we did</u>
<u n="5892" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but got into a good uni</u>
<u n="5893" who="S0236">mm</u>
<u n="5894" who="S0235" trans="overlap">we did access</u>
<u n="5895" who="S0236">yeah</u>
<u n="5896" who="S0235">which is just a like a quick way to get into it</u>
<u n="5897" who="S0198"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="5898" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I wish I'd known that <pause dur="short"/> one year of college</u>
<u n="5899" who="S0198" trans="overlap">just worked for a couple of years and then</u>
<u n="5900" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="5901" who="S0198">do the access</u>
<u n="5902" who="S0235">it was good I think it was it's good as well because nine times out of ten by the time you've done an access or you get round to doing an access course all of your friends have already gone on to do better things like</u>
<u n="5903" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="5904" who="S0235">or go to uni or go travelling or whatever it is</u>
<u n="5905" who="S0198" trans="overlap">it's a motivation</u>
<u n="5906" who="S0235">so you are a lot more kind of like</u>
<u n="5907" who="S0198">motivated</u>
<u n="5908" who="S0235" trans="overlap">dedicated</u>
<u n="5909" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="5910" who="S0198" trans="overlap">you would sit down like an easy year working full time when</u>
<u n="5911" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="5912" who="S0235" trans="overlap">yeah and like I don't wanna do anything so</u>
<u n="5913" who="S0198" trans="overlap">they don't know how shit that is</u>
<u n="5914" who="S0192">I personally think that in general I don't think that you should be allowed to go to university until you're twenty-one</u>
<u n="5915" who="S0235">no</u>
<u n="5916" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I honestly think that they should be a break and you should travel work do whatever it is</u>
<u n="5917" who="S0235">mm</u>
<u n="5918" who="S0192">but it makes me laugh that you're seventeen and eleven months and you're not you can't be tried under the the law the proper law like as an adult but as soon as you click over to eighteen here's a fifteen grand debt</u>
<u n="5919" who="S0236" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="5920" who="S0192">a debt that's gonna last for thirty years of your life I honestly think that if you put uni back and say that you're gotta be twenty-one to go to uni some people that wouldn't normally go to uni would end up going to uni because they would've figured their life out a bit more and other people that were just floating through maybe wouldn't have gone in the first place</u>
<u n="5921" who="S0235" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="5922" who="S0192">because you have to consider it a bit more</u>
<u n="5923" who="S0235">no I don't think it was a bad idea I think it's probably quite a good one</u>
<u n="5924" who="S0198" trans="overlap">many access courses are like saying it is the only thing that we can do</u>
<u n="5925" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="5926" who="S0235">but part of <trunc>th</trunc>that the access course originally you had to be nineteen</u>
<u n="5927" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="5928" who="S0235">and over the <trunc>tu</trunc></u>
<u n="5929" who="S0198" trans="overlap">like they've changed that now</u>
<u n="5930" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="5931" who="S0235" trans="overlap">but now they're talking no they were talking at one point about taking it down to like sixteen</u>
<u n="5932" who="S0192">what?</u>
<u n="5933" who="S0235">so you could just do that instead of doing your A levels</u>
<u n="5934" who="S0198">and then go to university when you're younger?</u>
<u n="5935" who="S0235" trans="overlap">I guess so</u>
<u n="5936" who="S0192" trans="overlap">what?</u>
<u n="5937" who="S0236">mm</u>
<u n="5938" who="S0235" trans="overlap">and I was no you like it's completely <pause dur="short"/> completely pointless so</u>
<u n="5939" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah I don't think it's some er</u>
<u n="5940" who="S0235">it deceives the point like and also part of the reason when you do</u>
<u n="5941" who="S0198" trans="overlap">experience of uni</u>
<u n="5942" who="S0235">you do an access course as opposed to doing A levels</u>
<u n="5943" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="5944" who="S0235" trans="overlap">you don't have to sit with a bunch of like sixteen-year-old kids who do not wanna be there</u>
<u n="5945" who="S0198" trans="overlap">senior olds</u>
<u n="5946" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="5947" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="5948" who="S0235" trans="overlap">and they're not gonna learn</u>
<u n="5949" who="S0192">but now you're gonna have to be with sixteen-year-olds</u>
<u n="5950" who="S0235">well if they do it I don't think they will do it</u>
<u n="5951" who="S0198" trans="overlap">but you could potentially be with sixteen no no no</u>
<u n="5952" who="S0235">because <trunc>l</trunc> there was <trunc>l</trunc> a lot of pressure to get there</u>
<u n="5953" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="5954" who="S0235">because it's it's the A levels for adults you know?</u>
<u n="5955" who="S0192">when they put the prices up for uni</u>
<u n="5956" who="S0198" trans="overlap">I don't think that's</u>
<u n="5957" who="S0192">there was protesting going on right?</u>
<u n="5958" who="S0235" trans="overlap">yeah loads</u>
<u n="5959" who="S0198" trans="overlap">there was a lot of protesting yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="5960" who="S0235" trans="overlap">there were things at my uni like everything</u>
<u n="5961" who="S0192" trans="overlap">anything happen?</u>
<u n="5962" who="S0235">lots of <trunc>s</trunc> of what? yeah lots of unis were like</u>
<u n="5963" who="S0192" trans="overlap">as in did they make any ground? did they?</u>
<u n="5964" who="S0235">yeah er we're not gonna do it and then they did it anyway</u>
<u n="5965" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="5966" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="5967" who="S0235">well <trunc>c</trunc> there's not really much you can actually do</u>
<u n="5968" who="S0192">so protesting is kinda pointless isn't it? really</u>
<u n="5969" who="S0235">yeah and it doesn't really work very well</u>
<u n="5970" who="S0198" trans="overlap">you don't achieve so much with that</u>
<u n="5971" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah they've got so whipped here</u>
<u n="5972" who="S0235">there was a really good option that I was really pro for erm <pause dur="short"/> as opposed to the increasing tuition fees which would set like student tax so you didn't pay to go to uni but after you finish uni for the rest of your life you would have tax</u>
<u n="5973" who="S0192" trans="overlap">you pay a tax so it's like</u>
<u n="5974" who="S0198" trans="overlap">tax which is what they call my student loan yeah</u>
<u n="5975" who="S0192" trans="overlap">which is effectively what our student loans are yeah</u>
<u n="5976" who="S0235" trans="overlap">yeah <trunc>eff</trunc>effectively it's</u>
<u n="5977" who="S0192" trans="overlap">student tax</u>
<u n="5978" who="S0235">you pay like ten percent of your wages so if you're on a hundred grand it's obviously a lot more</u>
<u n="5979" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="5980" who="S0235">than if you're on fifteen but over a certain amount you pay a student tax</u>
<u n="5981" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="5982" who="S0235" trans="overlap">and then everyone pays it</u>
<u n="5983" who="S0192">do you guys still have bachelors loans?</u>
<u n="5984" who="S0198" trans="overlap">that's kind of more fair because then they're like</u>

<u n="6996" who="S0192">cos we were in the middle of nowhere so there's no dog</u>
<u n="6997" who="S0198" trans="overlap">and then they did find this vaccination which was a massive relief but the instructions were in English so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had to sit on Google translate</u>

<u n="8349" who="S0235">oh as if you were</u>
<u n="8350" who="S0198">normal sided yeah not more than anything <unclear/> on your glasses</u>
<u n="8351" who="S0235" trans="overlap">yeah</u>

<u n="8353" who="S0235" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="8354" who="S0198">you know when you were really like when I was wearing lenses my brothers <pause dur="short"/> everyone gets persuaded to wear glasses and then you you wear them all the time and your eyes can get worse so they just get worse anyway or you don't wear them and your eyes never really get any worse and I told my brother</u>
<u n="8355" who="S0235" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="8356" who="S0198">don't make them cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> started wearing them all the time and he really doesn't need them <pause dur="short"/> and I was trying to <trunc>s</trunc>stop him from doing that because I think it will weaken his eyes rather than <pause dur="short"/> help him but yeah when I put yours on I could notice quite a big difference</u>
<u n="8357" who="S0235">yeah it is like</u>
<u n="8358" who="S0236" trans="overlap">oh what's this thing?</u>
<u n="8359" who="S0198">but yeah I wear lenses like</u>
<u n="8360" who="S0235" trans="overlap">and they get worse if I've worn them all day</u>
<u n="8361" who="S0198" trans="overlap">not to see people I don't usually <pause dur="short"/> if I'm not seeing or going anywhere</u>
<u n="8362" who="S0236" trans="overlap">have you got a thin thing?</u>
<u n="8363" who="S0235" trans="overlap">what's a thin thing?</u>
<u n="8364" who="S0236">well something that's thin enough to go in there and manipulate that wire</u>
<u n="8365" who="S0235">no er</u>
<u n="8366" who="S0236">something thin thin or thin</u>
<u n="8367" who="S0198" trans="overlap">like a pair of tweezers or something more</u>
<u n="8368" who="S0236" trans="overlap">yeah a pair of tweezers would be lovely</u>
<u n="8369" who="S0198">yeah I don't know if a pair of tweezers would work</u>
<u n="8370" who="S0235">you need erm</u>
<u n="8371" who="S0198">maybe I have something up there</u>
<u n="8372" who="S0236">oh</u>
<u n="8373" who="S0235">that's so strange I've never seen this before</u>
<u n="8374" who="S0236">what?</u>
<u n="8375" who="S0235">well normally these holes here <pause dur="short"/> have erm like this and they're like fine tuning so what happens is like when it goes out of tune you if it goes out a lot then you can do it by the pegs but if it's a</u>
<u n="8376" who="S0236">little</u>
<u n="8377" who="S0235">small yeah like fine tuning you do it with these bottom pegs</u>
<u n="8378" who="S0198">oh yeah</u>
<u n="8379" who="S0235" trans="overlap">cos it's only got one for the eighth string you don't have one for the other strings but I've I'm not saying that is wrong I'm just saying that I haven't seen that before</u>
<u n="8380" who="S0198" trans="overlap">oh but you've never seen that before oh that's so that could be it could be</u>
<u n="8381" who="S0235" trans="overlap">no so mine have</u>
<u n="8382" who="S0198">yeah it's got one for each?</u>
<u n="8383" who="S0235">yeah so so you just can find</u>
<u n="8384" who="S0198" trans="overlap">so you might find that these wooden pegs don't mean much</u>
<u n="8385" who="S0235" trans="overlap">no not necessarily it might be that because <pause dur="short"/> I've only ever dealt with mine and mine's got plastic pegs</u>
<u n="8386" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="8387" who="S0235">but plastic slip</u>
<u n="8388" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="8389" who="S0235" trans="overlap">are a lot easier so you <pause dur="short"/> they don't tend to you have to make a big difference with them for them to really hold so that's maybe why but I mean</u>
<u n="8390" who="S0198" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="8391" who="S0235" trans="overlap">it's got the fine tuning eighth string so there must be a reason for it</u>
<u n="8392" who="S0198">something else</u>
<u n="8393" who="S0235">because someone's obviously tuned</u>
<u n="8394" who="S0236">yeah</u>
<u n="8395" who="S0235">or like string strung it stringed it I don't know</u>
<u n="8396" who="S0236" trans="overlap">string strung it</u>
<u n="8397" who="S0198" trans="overlap">oh that seems quite good though as it's level four I'd love to hear you play</u>
<u n="8398" who="S0235" trans="overlap">oh no that is terrible <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="8399" who="S0198">and next time I'm home next time I'm in <anon type="place"/> I'm gonna make you play the violin</u>
<u n="8400" who="S0235" trans="overlap">it's really it is so awful</u>
<u n="8401" who="S0198" trans="overlap">I don't <unclear/></u>
<u n="8402" who="S0235" trans="overlap">no that's that's a good thing probably</u>
<u n="8403" who="S0198">yeah it's got no damp <pause dur="short"/> oh the damp</u>
<u n="8404" who="S0235">it's a fucking shithole erm</u>
