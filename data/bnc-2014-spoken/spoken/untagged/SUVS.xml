<u n="984" who="S0641" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="985" who="S0614">because that's what the the other people the the the er <pause dur="short"/> they deal with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and the contractors signed for to say they've had these pipe numbers and one of them would come back and dispute they've had them or not had them so but if we've got somebody there from our side saying yes you have had them</u>
<u n="986" who="S0641" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="987" who="S0614">and there's a picture of what you've had blah blah blah then it saves work in disputes</u>
<u n="988" who="S0525">they get a wagon turns up and the wagon because these pipes are <pause dur="short"/> erm hundred and twenty mil diameter thirteen and a half metres long</u>
<u n="989" who="S0614" trans="overlap">they are big pipes</u>
<u n="990" who="S0641"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="991" who="S0525">so they'll get they'll get four of these pipes on a wagon and you'd probably get between four and six wagons a day turning up because they take two hours to offload these four pipes <pause dur="short"/> they've got this clever device which has got these suction caps on <pause dur="short"/> that lift them up and plonk them down and then they they lay them out in a in a line so they are ready to be rolled into the trench and put together erm or they use a crane offload <pause dur="short"/> so it just takes a long time to offload this sort of pipe you've got to take all the ties off holding it on the wagon cos it's been transported by road so it's a big job so you've got maybe twenty to twenty-eight pipes turning up a day <pause dur="short"/> erm and all you've got to do so it's it's not high you know it's not a lot it's not like your leggings where you've got hundreds a day you've got maybe twenty pieces and each one has got a pipe number on the end and you've just got to write the pipe number down on the delivery note and get somebody in charge to sign it so that they'll pay for it</u>
<u n="992" who="S0641">mm</u>
<u n="993" who="S0525">and every pipe number <pause dur="short"/> is traceable back to the production process in Turkey <pause dur="short"/> or Holland because I think they are being made in Turkey then they've gone to Holland to be coated and lined then they've gone to site so if any of these pipes fail over the next twenty years <pause dur="short"/> what they'll do is they'll dig it up they'll find the give the pipe number and they will want to trace it back and they might say oh there was a problem with that that batch</u>

<u n="1002" who="S0641" trans="overlap">in the Caribbean</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0525">it is like anything if they find there was a there was a production problem with a batch then they'll want to <trunc>i</trunc>identify every pipe number in that batch to say you might have potential problems</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0641" trans="overlap">a batch problem yeah</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0525">and we've had it we've had it in the twenty years we have been dealing with these pipes</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0641">it happens doesn't it?</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0525">yeah so that's what it's for but then the other problem is the pipe numbers are normally handwritten on so when they start in Turkey it's a six digit number usually maybe eight digits written on this pipe and then they go and get coated and that it's gone over so somebody has <trunc>writ</trunc> somebody's written it down it has gone into the coating plant and it's come out they've written it back on so you've got human error there because somebody somebody at paid five pound an hour is not gonna write the right number on then you've got the fact that the ones are done like that with the sevens</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0614" trans="overlap">seven</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0525">got a line through it and the nines they do like that which look like fours to us so nines and fours ones and sevens</u>

<u n="1011" who="S0525">so it's you know it's always gonna be fraught with</u>

<u n="1020" who="S0525">have come off <pause dur="short"/> so they are saying right it's dirty inside it's got X Y Z but dirty inside doesn't matter because once they've laid this pipeline underground they have to blast it to clean it anyway cos <trunc>i</trunc> cos it's got drinking water</u>

<u n="1059" who="S0617" trans="overlap">and you have to pay them</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0525">yeah and that happens for the crane might break down the offload you know it's not to do with the wagon it's the crane's broken down something's happened to the site they've all had to disappear health and safety reasons there'll be something going on all the time it happens erm but then the transport company try it on and they'd like put hours and hours on demurrage well if you've had your own person on site you can say actually we had half an hour there we had two hours there right so we are not accepting ten hours</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0641" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0525">we are accepting two and a half hours and I say that's another thing you've you've got to clock</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0614">just keep in mind</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0525">yeah and and and make a note yourself because if you've got somebody on site you are clocking that yourself and you've also got the guy in the wagon and you let him know you are clocking it and then they don't</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0641">they won't take the mick</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0525">yeah and it's things like that that just add up because these are I mean this is a four million pound job <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> everybody tries to</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0641">get a few extra quid here and there</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0525">of course they do</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0614">they're just all companies aren't they trying to make?</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0525">of course they do</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0641">at <anon type="place"/> it used to be about fifty pounds an hour for that</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0525">demurrage</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0641">yeah</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0525">yeah</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0641">that's what I'm saying and it soon adds up</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0641">doesn't it if your lorry has broken down for five hours</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0641">that's two hundred and fifty quid for <pause dur="short"/> crazy</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah that's it <pause dur="short"/> so if you've got you know and if you use companies that you use a lot and you know you've got a good relationship with them then you know that they are probably okay but if you are using companies that are local up there you they are going to put in everything they can get away with especially if they think you you don't know</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0617" trans="overlap">is there a <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0641" trans="overlap">of course they are <pause dur="short"/> of course they are</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0525">and you've got so many different people on site on a job like that that nobody is willing to say welI I know</u>

<u n="1085" who="S0525">yeah nobody is willing they just pass the buck and say oh you've just got to erm <pause dur="short"/> accept it <pause dur="short"/> so it's the that's that's the reason I mean we never used to have people on site for these jobs <pause dur="short"/> but then we never got paid unless we've not had them and but if we now provide a signed their signed delivery note with an invoice your guy has signed that you've had those four pipes pay it <pause dur="short"/> oh then that's what you've got to do sign it</u>

<u n="1089" who="S0525">that's what they've got to do</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0641" trans="overlap">it's a shame it's got like that isn't it?</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0525">but it does because they they they are paying probably eighty percent maybe eighty-five percent <pause dur="short"/> of the value of this four million pound contract they are paying eighty-five percent before it gets delivered to site that's been agreed it's been so as soon as it arrives in the UK they pay that</u>

<u n="1096" who="S0641" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so both ways are trying to do things</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah and we and we've we've come across it time and time again and the only way to get round it is to have somebody on site twenty-four seven <pause dur="short"/> and even then they'll they'll still query it but you know <trunc>you</trunc>you've got the proof and if you are going to take it to court they've got very little place to go</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0641">yeah</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0525">so we've just learnt that over the years because we thought well great they'll pay the fifteen percent and then they come up with the demurrage and they come up with this and they come up that they haven't got the pipes I think well you've had that pipe number three times well we guess because you can't read the numbers properly <vocal desc="laugh"/> so we are not paying for that pipe three you know but you know you've had that many pipes so yeah the numbers might be wrong but you've agreed you've had you know five hundred pipes oh it just goes on it goes round and round in circles</u>
