<u n="70" who="S0198">well it says your contract is ready and waiting for you in this welcome pack give it the once over to make sure everything's in order when you're happy sign the customer copy date it and pop it back to us <pause dur="short"/> so I don't know if like you need to do that before</u>

<u n="72" who="S0198">that's what you grabbed yesterday off the guy wasn't it?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0192">yeah yeah but when did they supposedly send it out?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0198">twenty-third of August <pause dur="short"/> it's dated which is rubbish cos yesterday was the twenty-seventh</u>
<u n="75" who="S0192">so you are you meant to? you're not meant to have got this back to them I don't think</u>
<u n="76" who="S0198">what before you know?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0192">surely it's got to get to you and then you send it to them they dated it the twenty-third it might not get to me till the twenty-fifth</u>
<u n="78" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0192">as it was it was the twenty-sixth <pause dur="long"/> you have seven working days starting from the day after this contract has entered into to cancel it <pause dur="short"/> so you can cancel it within seven days I'm tempted to just leave this now until they install it <pause dur="short"/> it just says my contract ah contract date is from Friday the twenty-ninth I mean I'll ask the guy when he comes round what do I do with this then? do I just give it to you or do I?</u>
<u n="80" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0192">do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0198">I think you'll find that he's just like the tech guy and you have to send that in</u>
<u n="83" who="S0192">I mean I agree but I don't think it's a problem</u>
<u n="84" who="S0198">I assume they will give us the internet connection I mean should we have signed something? they have our bank details in there</u>
<u n="85" who="S0192">yeah I mean I've already given them the bank details</u>
<u n="86" who="S0198">we don't need to they're still gonna <trunc>act</trunc> he's not just going to install something and then not activate it until they receive our contract are they?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0192">oh god I hope not <pause dur="short"/> erm if attention if you're a new customer your first bill will show a different charge than that shown on this contract what? if you do not pay by direct <pause dur="short"/> am I set up for direct debit?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0198"><unclear/> the best way to install <unclear/> broadband so the guy's meant to phone you before he arrives on Friday</u>
<u n="89" who="S0192">is he? do they have my telephone number?</u>
<u n="90" who="S0198">well I assume so did you give Virgin your telephone number?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0192">I guess so <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure I would have done</u>
<u n="92" who="S0198">or did you give them to somebody else?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0192">I kind of need the internet to be able to check this stuff</u>
<u n="94" who="S0198">I know it's kind of ironic isn't it <pause dur="short"/> we're so used to just going online and looking up the answers to questions</u>
<u n="95" who="S0192">yeah is there a telephone number that I can ring for them anywhere?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0198">I imagine there is customer service see it makes you think how much is that going to cost though? free oh</u>
<u n="97" who="S0192">Skype if you have the internet yeah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0198">maybe it depends on the number though doesn't it <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="99" who="S0192">I can't find it</u>
<u n="100" who="S0198"><unclear/> there must be a telephone number on this package somewhere</u>
<u n="101" who="S0192">yeah I'm sure there is</u>
<u n="102" who="S0198">people are going to want to call them up and ask questions</u>
<u n="103" who="S0192">okay do I just leave that for now then?</u>
<u n="104" who="S0198">yeah I guess so</u>

<u n="167" who="S0192">anything else?</u>
<u n="168" who="S0198">erm if we go past any second hand shops we should probably look in to see if they've got a curtain net and curtain wire cos that will be the cheapest place to buy it I would think</u>
<u n="169" who="S0192">god I need something to write on</u>
<u n="170" who="S0198">erm</u>
<u n="171" who="S0192">so what was the first thing we said?</u>

<u n="188" who="S0198">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="189" who="S0192">or maybe it's two racks or something I don't know but it's erm it's like metal poles that you need to put together I can't be certain that all the bits are there but that would definitely definitely work</u>

<u n="191" who="S0192">yeah</u>

<u n="342" who="S0198" trans="overlap"><unclear/> as always <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="343" who="S0192">more than my family <pause dur="short"/> my mum and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
