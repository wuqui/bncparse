<u n="71" who="S0018">no there are <pause dur="short"/> there's always a crazy person walking along Ruchi's road <pause dur="short"/> shouting on his own <pause dur="short"/> beating his chest or</u>
<u n="72" who="S0019">oh my goodness</u>
<u n="73" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="75" who="S0018">I think <anon type="place"/> attracts them</u>
<u n="76" who="S0019">well I think <anon type="place"/>'s always been a little bit um of a Bohemian place</u>
<u n="77" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0019">well it's always had that reputation</u>
<u n="79" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I don't see the connection between Bohemian and crazy</u>
<u n="80" who="S0019">well you often get people who are a little mm challenged will congregate in a less conventional area</u>
<u n="81" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0018">er</u>
<u n="84" who="S0019">Cos I think they don't feel quite so out of place</u>
<u n="85" who="S0018">oh <pause dur="short"/> I thought it was because um a lot of the crazies and I'm not saying crazy as a er derogatory term <pause dur="short"/> I'm saying is people who er do actually have um something wrong with them and</u>
<u n="86" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0018">for that reason they're shouting to the skies <pause dur="short"/> they tend to beg on the high street <pause dur="short"/> and I think it's because it's such a hub</u>
<u n="88" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="89" who="S0018">of activity <pause dur="short"/> there's always a lot of people there</u>
<u n="90" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> could be</u>
<u n="91" who="S0018">I'd assume that it was for that reason</u>
<u n="92" who="S0019">well I er expect that's part of it <pause dur="short"/> but again the people who come to beg in all probability don't live in the area</u>
<u n="93" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="94" who="S0019">they come into that area because they know the pickings are good <pause dur="short"/> I think that's er it's like Solihull <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure we get an awful lot of these Eastern European concertina players who really can't play at all <pause dur="short"/> uh <pause dur="short"/> there were a there was a couple two men a couple of weeks ago <pause dur="short"/> I've seen them before <pause dur="short"/> one plays the saxophone <pause dur="short"/> and one has a concertina <pause dur="short"/> and they were playing the same tune</u>
<u n="95" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0019">over and over again</u>
<u n="97" who="S0018">on three chords</u>
<u n="98" who="S0019">and it wasn't even quite the right tune</u>
<u n="99" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="100" who="S0019">it was their own variation</u>
<u n="101" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0019">oh dear me</u>
<u n="103" who="S0018">aw</u>
<u n="104" who="S0019">it was painful <pause dur="short"/> and there's a woman an Eastern European woman who plays sits and plays <pause dur="short"/> and she can't play at all <pause dur="short"/> she's not playing a tune <pause dur="short"/> she's just playing a random selection of notes <pause dur="short"/> and it uh</u>
<u n="105" who="S0018">well</u>
<u n="106" who="S0019">huh</u>
<u n="107" who="S0018">I think er they do it so that you pay them to stop playing</u>
<u n="108" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> It's like the guy with the bagpipes</u>
<u n="109" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="110" who="S0019">he plays outside um Marks and Spencers <pause dur="short"/> and it's quite a local joke <pause dur="short"/> er people go past and say we're paying you to stop</u>
<u n="111" who="S0018">aw</u>
<u n="112" who="S0019"><vocal desc="laugh"/> He takes it in very good <unclear/></u>
<u n="113" who="S0018">aw</u>
<u n="114" who="S0019"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="115" who="S0018">poor lad</u>
<u n="116" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0019">oh dear <pause dur="short"/> and he plays quite well <pause dur="short"/> it's not that he plays badly <pause dur="short"/> it's just that the bagpipes are not everybody's cup of tea</u>
<u n="118" who="S0018">A bit of a drone aren't they</u>
<u n="119" who="S0019">well it's best heard <vocal desc="laugh"/> from a distance</u>
<u n="120" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0019">and actually from a distance it's quite a pleasant sound <pause dur="short"/> but when it's right up close it isn't a pleasant sound</u>
<u n="122" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="123" who="S0019">unless you're passionately Scottish of course <pause dur="short"/> and then it doesn't really matter</u>
<u n="124" who="S0018">well in Spain they'd have the gypsies going round</u>
<u n="125" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="126" who="S0018">um round the streets with their what do you call it? The electronic keyboards</u>
<u n="127" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="128" who="S0018">with the automated</u>
<u n="129" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0018">rhythms <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="131" who="S0019">yep <pause dur="short"/> you get that in</u>
<u n="132" who="S0018">like the one I had</u>
<u n="133" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you get it in main square</u>
<u n="134" who="S0018">but they also get a shopping trolley and make a sound system</u>
<u n="135" who="S0019"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="136" who="S0018">so they have really loud loud speakers</u>
<u n="137" who="S0019">uh</u>
<u n="138" who="S0018">and and it is</u>
<u n="139" who="S0019">yes</u>
<u n="140" who="S0018">it's like the <trunc>autom</trunc></u>
<u n="141" who="S0019"><unclear/></u>
<u n="142" who="S0018">the automatic er rhythm that I used</u>
<u n="143" who="S0019">mhm</u>
<u n="144" who="S0018">to have on my</u>
<u n="145" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="146" who="S0018">casio keyboard <pause dur="short"/> dum de de dum dum</u>
<u n="147" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0018">dum de de dum dum <pause dur="short"/> dum de de dum dum <pause dur="short"/> dum <pause dur="short"/> and uh that at eight o'clock on Sunday morning <pause dur="short"/> and you'd get people <trunc>r</trunc> er</u>
<u n="149" who="S0019"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="150" who="S0018">leaning out of their windows throwing them coins and saying</u>
<u n="151" who="S0019">just to shut up</u>
<u n="152" who="S0018">now go</u>
<u n="153" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="154" who="S0019">oh dear <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>s</trunc> talking about Eastern Europeans and begging <pause dur="short"/> do you remember when you were in Paris and we came to see you and we were outside the Eiffel Tower and those gangs</u>
<u n="155" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="156" who="S0019">of beggars?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="158" who="S0019">the children <pause dur="short"/> they were all filthy dirty as well <pause dur="short"/> and I'm not sure whether that was done deliberately to gain sympathy</u>
<u n="159" who="S0018">well anyone who has to resort to begging would get my sympathy <pause dur="short"/> I don't know whether they'd get my money</u>
<u n="160" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="161" who="S0018">but they'd get my sympathy</u>
<u n="162" who="S0019">well <pause dur="short"/> the problem is that over here begging has become a profession <pause dur="short"/> it's not they don't do it because they have to do it</u>
<u n="163" who="S0018">er no but is that through necessity cos they can't get a job?</u>
<u n="164" who="S0019">no because it's the easy option <pause dur="short"/> they can earn as much money mm depending on where they go in a day than they could earn in an ordinary job</u>
<u n="165" who="S0018">well I'm not</u>
<u n="166" who="S0019">they don't pay any taxes</u>
<u n="167" who="S0018">well I'm sure that there's a lot of people who are begging that would prefer to have a job</u>
<u n="168" who="S0019">well <pause dur="short"/> I haven't done a survey so I wouldn't know <pause dur="short"/> but it is quite common <vocal desc="cough"/> that they earn considerably more than they would do doing a er minimum wage job</u>
<u n="169" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0019">and of course they don't pay taxes <pause dur="short"/> and but they still qualify they they qualify for benefits <pause dur="short"/> they still get benefits <pause dur="short"/> seems a crazy system to me <pause dur="short"/> but hey what do I know?</u>
<u n="171" who="S0018">well with a minimum wage job not being able to pay er for a living not to be <trunc>ab</trunc> not is huh not being a living wage I'm not surprised that people take other avenues to get the money that they need to live er and then get a bit cheeky</u>
<u n="172" who="S0019">but there are people who do live on er on the minimum wage</u>
<u n="173" who="S0018">well I doubt they er make ends meet very comfortably</u>
<u n="174" who="S0019">well most people who are on minimum wage qualify for benefits as well <pause dur="short"/> so it's not they're not totally dependent on</u>
<u n="175" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="176" who="S0019">and especially if they've got children <pause dur="short"/> and very often they will get housing allowance and things like that <pause dur="short"/> which makes their rents much more affordable</u>
<u n="177" who="S0018">hm <pause dur="short"/> what is the minimum wage then?</u>
<u n="178" who="S0019">huh <pause dur="short"/> I think now it's about it's six pounds something an hour</u>
<u n="179" who="S0018">blimey</u>
<u n="180" who="S0019">or seven pounds an hour <pause dur="short"/> something like that</u>
<u n="181" who="S0018">so what would that be like in a yearly figure? If you</u>
<u n="182" who="S0019">um puh depends on how many hours a week you work</u>
<u n="183" who="S0018">like if er if you're working full-time hours</u>
<u n="184" who="S0019">if you're working a forty-hour week which is about two hundred and eighty pounds a week <pause dur="short"/> say three hundred for the sake of argument <pause dur="short"/> that's twelve hundred a month <pause dur="short"/> so it's about fourteen thousand a year <pause dur="short"/> and as I say it depends on your individual circumstances</u>
<u n="185" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="186" who="S0019">but there is um so people get housing benefit and other benefits as well <pause dur="short"/> income support <pause dur="short"/> various other bits and pieces <pause dur="short"/> dependent on circumstances <pause dur="short"/> you can't it's not a blanket thing at all <pause dur="short"/> I mean we at the court we only get about a pound an hour more than the minimum wage</u>
<u n="187" who="S0018">yep <pause dur="short"/> yep</u>
<u n="188" who="S0019">you know <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="189" who="S0018">well it's like</u>
<u n="190" who="S0019">so</u>
<u n="191" who="S0018">teaching assistants</u>
<u n="192" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="193" who="S0018">they can be working full-time and be</u>
<u n="194" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="195" who="S0018">getting paid fifteen grand</u>
<u n="196" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> but there are huh there are lots of jobs that pay that much</u>
<u n="197" who="S0018">that little <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="198" who="S0019">or that little <pause dur="short"/> whichever way you want to look at it</u>
<u n="199" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="200" who="S0019">so but then when you think back to what you were getting paid in Spain</u>
<u n="201" who="S0018">yeah but that was by no means minimum wage <pause dur="short"/> because there were people on about half of what I was on</u>
<u n="202" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> but compared to minimum wage earnings and what you were earning</u>
<u n="203" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="204" who="S0019">there's not much difference is there?</u>
<u n="205" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but you can't really make those comparisons across cultures</u>
<u n="206" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <trunc>wha</trunc> I'd be interested to know what um language teachers in the similar schools to yours in this country are being paid</u>
<u n="207" who="S0018">well they're not being paid a fixed er er rate because I don't think there are many posts that are year round</u>
<u n="208" who="S0019">no</u>
<u n="209" who="S0018">permanent</u>
<u n="210" who="S0019">no</u>
<u n="211" who="S0018">full-time</u>
<u n="212" who="S0019">but then yours wasn't was it? Really</u>

<u n="215" who="S0018">by because of the holidays over the summer</u>
<u n="216" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> but I don't know <pause dur="short"/> but we've never considered um ushers us ushers that we're paid an awful lot <pause dur="short"/> I mean Laura was a full-time senior usher and I think she was on about seventeen thousand</u>
<u n="217" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="218" who="S0019">so the Courts Service is not hugely paid</u>
<u n="219" who="S0018">but it would be fine if people didn't have to fork out so much for <trunc>r</trunc> accommodation</u>
<u n="220" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="221" who="S0018">I really do believe that</u>
<u n="222" who="S0019">and you pay less in on a mortgage than you do in rent provided you can stump up enough of a deposit</u>
<u n="223" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="224" who="S0019">that's the ridiculous part about it <pause dur="short"/> and because people can't buy houses as easily as they used to be able to extra pressure on the rental market so the landlords hike the rents</u>
<u n="225" who="S0018">yep <pause dur="short"/> it's not fair</u>
<u n="226" who="S0019">it isn't fair</u>
<u n="227" who="S0018">but hey</u>
<u n="228" who="S0019">but unfortunately it's the law of supply and demand isn't it</u>
<u n="229" who="S0018">no <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="230" who="S0019">are you limping <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="231" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it's the er <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="232" who="S0019">are you limping?</u>
<u n="233" who="S0018">it's the cheekiness of some people to to er hike rents up</u>
<u n="234" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="235" who="S0018">and hike prices up just because they can</u>
<u n="236" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> well it's like the holiday industry that hikes prices in the school holidays <pause dur="short"/> because they know that a lot of people can only go in the school holidays <pause dur="short"/> so we hike the prices <pause dur="short"/> there's no economic reason for it other than they know that a lot of people have to take their holidays in that time</u>
<u n="237" who="S0018">well it's even more it's even worse when you're talking about housing because shelter is supposed to be one of the human rights <pause dur="short"/> so if you've got people making profit out of</u>
<u n="238" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="239" who="S0018">housing people I just don't think that's right</u>
<u n="240" who="S0019">but then on the other hand people have bought houses have mortgages have to pay the mortgages so they have to charge rent to cover the mortgage <pause dur="short"/> they can't do it any other way unless you've got a spare</u>
<u n="241" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="242" who="S0019">three hundred thousand quid to to spend</u>
<u n="243" who="S0018">what was your scenario again? I didn't catch that <pause dur="short"/> er</u>
<u n="244" who="S0019">that the people who have bought the houses that people rent or the flats that people rent</u>
<u n="245" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="246" who="S0019">have probably bought them on mortgages</u>
<u n="247" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="248" who="S0019">so they've got to pay the mortgage so they have to pay they have the tenants have to pay the mortgage costs</u>
<u n="249" who="S0018">so while this other guy is living comfortably in his own little house</u>
<u n="250" who="S0019">because</u>
<u n="251" who="S0018">why <trunc>sh</trunc> why should he</u>
<u n="252" who="S0019">but he's still got</u>
<u n="253" who="S0018">be able to make a profit out of?</u>
<u n="254" who="S0019">well he's he's still got overheads <pause dur="short"/> he's still got repairs <pause dur="short"/> upkeep <pause dur="short"/> insurance</u>
<u n="255" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> fair enough</u>
<u n="256" who="S0019">all that sort of thing</u>
<u n="257" who="S0018">fair enough</u>
<u n="258" who="S0019">well it's like any business <pause dur="short"/> you go into a business with the idea of making profit</u>
<u n="259" who="S0018">yeah er what I'm saying is that er housing shouldn't be for profit</u>
<u n="260" who="S0019">unfortunately</u>
<u n="261" who="S0018">so it should be divorced</u>
<u n="262" who="S0019">everything's for profit</u>
<u n="263" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know <pause dur="short"/> that's the problem</u>
<u n="264" who="S0019">that's life</u>
<u n="265" who="S0018">I just think it should be divorced from the idea of business <pause dur="short"/> there shouldn't be businesses that are making a profit from housing people <pause dur="short"/> because they'll they'll always start hiking prices up to make more profit and that's just</u>
<u n="266" who="S0019">tis in the nature of the beast unfortunately</u>
<u n="267" who="S0018">well they need to put some restrictions and regulations in place <pause dur="short"/> cos I'm sure the people who rent out their houses <trunc>d</trunc> and make profit they're <trunc>pr</trunc> yeah yeah but I should be able to do that <pause dur="short"/> it's my  it's my  right <pause dur="short"/> it's my house <pause dur="short"/> I can rent it out <pause dur="short"/> it's yeah fair enough but when you're creating the problem of hiking prices up and making tut you know making</u>
<u n="268" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="269" who="S0018">people homeless because they can't afford to to live in a marketplace house</u>
<u n="270" who="S0019">I would be interested to know how much the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> how much profit the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and the <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> make on their houses <pause dur="short"/> cos they rent out houses to students</u>
<u n="271" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="272" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> no I'd be very interested to know</u>
<u n="273" who="S0018">again that needs to be changed as well <pause dur="short"/> that should be university run <pause dur="short"/> because the university last year um <trunc>s</trunc> sourced it out to another company</u>
<u n="274" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="275" who="S0018">who was running all the student accommodation for profit because it's a business</u>
<u n="276" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="277" who="S0018">and all of a sudden the refuse collection is cut to once every two weeks <pause dur="short"/> and I mean once every two weeks? You can imagine</u>
<u n="278" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="279" who="S0018">with like twenty students for each bin <pause dur="short"/> no even more because there were three houses <pause dur="short"/> so thirty students for each bin <pause dur="short"/> and the bins are only collected once every fortnight <pause dur="short"/> it was disgusting <pause dur="short"/> and you <trunc>s</trunc> started getting rats</u>
<u n="280" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="281" who="S0018">around <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="282" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="283" who="S0018">instead of having um a very basic but free internet connection</u>
<u n="284" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="285" who="S0018">they they again outsourced the internet to another company who came in and put super rapid quick fire amazing internet in but then charged you</u>
<u n="286" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="287" who="S0018">per person fifteen quid <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="288" who="S0019">how often? Fifteen quid</u>
<u n="289" who="S0018">A month</u>
<u n="290" who="S0019">per month?</u>
<u n="291" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> per person</u>
<u n="292" who="S0019">oo</u>
<u n="293" who="S0018">so you're thinking if if ten students sign up for it in one house</u>
<u n="294" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="295" who="S0018">you know they're raking in a hundred and fifty on what they would in</u>
<u n="296" who="S0019">mhm</u>
<u n="297" who="S0018">a normal house probably only thirty or forty</u>
<u n="298" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="299" who="S0018">so it just became for <trunc>pr</trunc> everything was for profit</u>
<u n="300" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="301" who="S0018">you know where is the whole ethos</u>

<u n="303" who="S0018">of</u>
<u n="304" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> unfortunately universities now don't have the funds to do what they used to do</u>
<u n="305" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="306" who="S0019">I mean when you think back to when I was at college we paid nothing <pause dur="short"/> no tuition fees <pause dur="short"/> no board and lodging <pause dur="short"/> the education authority paid for all that <pause dur="short"/> but there was only a fraction of the number of pupils going to university or colleges as there are now</u>
<u n="307" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="308" who="S0019">you know <pause dur="short"/> er you you can't have it both ways unfortunately</u>
<u n="309" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="310" who="S0019">but I I still feel that universities should go back to being centres of academic <trunc>e</trunc> excellence</u>
<u n="311" who="S0018">I agree</u>
<u n="312" who="S0019">and have <trunc>m</trunc> far more vocational courses <pause dur="short"/> um because the majority not the majority but a large number of the people that they're sending to university shouldn't be there <pause dur="short"/> so they have Mickey Mouse degrees that are worth absolutely nothing <pause dur="short"/> doesn't enable them to get jobs and saddles them with a mountain of debt <pause dur="short"/> where's the logic in that?</u>
<u n="313" who="S0018">there is none</u>
<u n="314" who="S0019">it's ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> I'm still making up my mind to write to</u>

<u n="318" who="S0019">I'm thinking about it in my <trunc>mi</trunc> oo the other thing I've got to do as well is to write my um account of missing Lakka for the Tomahawk Newsletter</u>
<u n="319" who="S0018">what?</u>
<u n="320" who="S0019">you remember when we went sailing and we were going to go to Lakka on Paxos?</u>
<u n="321" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="322" who="S0019">and normally he will navigate us everywhere</u>
<u n="323" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="324" who="S0019">but this time he said no no no we'll see it <pause dur="short"/> and having done a six-hour complete circumnavigation of Paxos</u>

<u n="326" who="S0019">because we missed Lakka um it was rather daunting experience <pause dur="short"/> so I we I mean it we laugh about it now</u>
<u n="327" who="S0018">oh so it's not a letter of complaint? It's a</u>

<u n="329" who="S0018">oh I thought you said it was a letter</u>
<u n="330" who="S0019">oh no no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no no no <pause dur="short"/> my account of how we missed Lakka <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> We went afterwards and it is a very pretty place</u>
<u n="331" who="S0018">is it on Paxos?</u>
<u n="332" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="333" who="S0018">then how come you missed it?</u>
<u n="334" who="S0019">well it's got a very narrow entrance and then opens out into this big harbour type thing</u>
<u n="335" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="336" who="S0019">and the very narrow entrance is not easy to see <pause dur="short"/> um unless you're very close to it <pause dur="short"/> and it didn't look like an entrance</u>
<u n="337" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="338" who="S0019">it just looked like rocks and things <pause dur="short"/> so we missed it</u>
<u n="339" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="340" who="S0019">and I was getting decidedly panicky <pause dur="short"/> because once you get round the tip of the island the terrain changes <pause dur="short"/> it's sheer sides <pause dur="short"/> um rocks <pause dur="short"/> absolutely nowhere to stop <pause dur="short"/> and all I wanted to do was to get off the bloody boat</u>

<u n="345" who="S0018">oh is he only getting a motor boat this year?</u>
<u n="346" who="S0019">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> because the proper boats are a little bit expensive</u>
<u n="347" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="348" who="S0019">so we're having the the Villa Melissa for two weeks <pause dur="short"/> and then he can hire a little motor boat</u>

<u n="503" who="S0019">and it just strikes me that it's not huh I think there are more chances of mistakes being made that way</u>

<u n="505" who="S0019">you're not kidding</u>
<u n="506" who="S0018">I mean they've got no evidence whatsoever that gives him a motive or um</u>
<u n="507" who="S0019">opportunity</u>
<u n="508" who="S0018"><trunc>p</trunc> yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> er it just seems really strange <pause dur="short"/> he seems to think that because you know he was um</u>
<u n="509" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="510" who="S0018">he was a businessman</u>
<u n="511" who="S0019">in Russian mafia</u>
<u n="512" who="S0018">in Uzbekistan <pause dur="short"/> and they ended up leaving because</u>
<u n="513" who="S0019">mm</u>

<u n="515" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="516" who="S0018">it was all he was always visited by the mafia</u>
<u n="517" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="518" who="S0018">and they always made it very difficult for him to operate cleanly</u>
<u n="519" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="520" who="S0018">and so that was the motivation behind him leaving <pause dur="short"/> and so he thinks that it's retribution for that</u>
<u n="521" who="S0019">but even so <pause dur="short"/> how could they have done it without traces of accelerant or explosives or anything else?</u>
<u n="522" who="S0018">no idea</u>
<u n="523" who="S0019">I mean how else do they explain the fact that the car exploded?</u>
<u n="524" who="S0018">they haven't  they haven't  explained it <pause dur="short"/> but they're not trying to look for alternative <trunc>exp</trunc> explanations</u>
<u n="525" who="S0019">no they've they've got him and that's all they're interested in</u>
<u n="526" who="S0018">because they're just interested in pointing the finger at him and</u>
<u n="527" who="S0019">you see over here that would've gone to forensics <pause dur="short"/> and they would've gone over that car with a fine <trunc>co</trunc> tooth comb to try and identify</u>
<u n="528" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="529" who="S0019">exactly what the cause of the explosion was <pause dur="short"/> I I I would like to think they would've done the same in France but</u>
<u n="530" who="S0018">well I'm sure they would've done but</u>
<u n="531" who="S0019">you never know do you <pause dur="short"/> but again they have to have some sort of explanation for it <pause dur="short"/> you can't just say oh well it exploded we can't find anything but he must've done it</u>
<u n="532" who="S0018">well exactly <pause dur="short"/> that that is the</u>
<u n="533" who="S0019">you can't do that</u>
<u n="534" who="S0018">the logic behind it <pause dur="short"/> or the illogic behind it</u>
<u n="535" who="S0019">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> no it doesn't make any sense at all <pause dur="short"/> and who decides the appeal?</u>
<u n="536" who="S0018">well he <trunc>app</trunc> er he can appeal against</u>
<u n="537" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> he appeals <pause dur="short"/> but who decides the result of the appeal?</u>

<u n="747" who="S0019">no the huh I'm not sure whether the Napoleonic Code refers to the way um estates are inherited <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> cos there's a difference to how things are handed down between France and us</u>
<u n="748" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="749" who="S0019">I think in France it has to be distributed amongst everybody where we have I don't know <pause dur="short"/> there is some I wonder if it says in the dictionary</u>

<u n="759" who="S0019">oo <pause dur="short"/> french justice system I guess <pause dur="short"/> mm but huh it's <unclear/> I'm looking for aren't I <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no it doesn't actually say <pause dur="short"/> just gives the basic reference to Napoleon and Napoleonic <pause dur="short"/> oh that's interesting <pause dur="short"/> napoleon is a gold twenty franc piece or a nineteenth century high boot</u>
<u n="760" who="S0018">okay <pause dur="short"/> unlike English-speaking countries which use the system of common law France has a system of civil law <pause dur="short"/> whatever that means</u>
<u n="761" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> how do you? mm</u>
<u n="762" who="S0018">oh common law systems have evolved over the ages <pause dur="short"/> civil law systems are largely based on a code of law</u>
<u n="763" who="S0019"><trunc>W</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> which means what?</u>
<u n="764" who="S0018">I don't know</u>
<u n="765" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="766" who="S0019">that doesn't really help us very much does it? <vocal desc="laugh"/> Cos it doesn't really explain what this code is <pause dur="short"/> uh <pause dur="short"/> no I think you'd have to do a lot more investigation</u>
<u n="767" who="S0018">but you're right about Napoleon though <pause dur="short"/> it says um the basis of the legal system is laid out in a document knowed as known as the civil code er or the Napoleonic Code</u>
<u n="768" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> I knew there was something about Napoleon in it</u>
<u n="769" who="S0018">there are other codes including the penal code which defines criminal law</u>
<u n="770" who="S0019">yep <pause dur="short"/> which is what we have</u>
<u n="771" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so you've also got public law and private law</u>
<u n="772" who="S0019">I think we call that civil law</u>
<u n="773" who="S0018">you see I think that's why he had to have two different um tut tribunals? What do you call them?</u>
<u n="774" who="S0019">yeah</u>
<u n="775" who="S0018">court appearances</u>
<u n="776" who="S0019">yeah</u>
<u n="777" who="S0018">one for er civil and one for penal <pause dur="short"/> oh I don't know</u>
<u n="778" who="S0019">jeepers <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> a systematic collection of statutes a body of laws so arranged as to avoid inconsistency and overlapping <pause dur="short"/> well that system would seem to overlap <pause dur="short"/> cos you're doing the same two different uh two different hearings that cover pretty much the same evidence <pause dur="short"/> but then when you think all crimes go through our magistrates' courts</u>
<u n="779" who="S0018">all crimes do?</u>
<u n="780" who="S0019">yep <pause dur="short"/> murder will go through the magistrates' court <pause dur="short"/> the defendant will only be asked to give his name and date of birth and then it's immediately committed to the Crown Court</u>
<u n="781" who="S0018">hm <pause dur="short"/> oh it's always um mostly always presided over by judges</u>
<u n="782" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="783" who="S0018">in courts <pause dur="short"/> what's in assize courts?</u>

<u n="786" who="S0019">are</u>
<u n="787" who="S0018">what's an assize court?</u>
<u n="788" who="S0019">um it's wuh it's a sort of next stage up um er no assize court <pause dur="short"/> now assize court was something slightly different I think <pause dur="short"/> or is it what we call now the Crown Court?</u>
<u n="789" who="S0018">I have no idea</u>
<u n="790" who="S0019">no <pause dur="short"/> oh it's double S isn't it <pause dur="short"/> assize <pause dur="short"/> assize <pause dur="short"/> assize <pause dur="short"/> court sitting at intervals in each county of England and Wales to administer the civil and criminal law <pause dur="short"/> so it's our Crown Courts</u>
<u n="791" who="S0018">is that a local court as opposed to a national court?</u>
<u n="792" who="S0019">it's you've got the <trunc>m</trunc> the the magistrates' court which and every sort of big town has its own magistrates' court <pause dur="short"/> and then things that are too serious to be dealt with in the magistrates' court go up to the Crown Court</u>
<u n="793" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="794" who="S0019">and our Crown Court is in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="795" who="S0018">oh right <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="796" who="S0019">and then there's another one in um Warwick</u>
<u n="797" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="798" who="S0019">well it was in Warwick <pause dur="short"/> it's now in Leamington <pause dur="short"/> but it's called Warwick Crown Court</u>
<u n="799" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="800" who="S0019">so it goes in bigger areas</u>
<u n="801" who="S0018">I see</u>
<u n="802" who="S0019">but it is <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> what we used to call the assize courts are <pause dur="short"/> but the difference now is it's not sitting at intervals <pause dur="short"/> they sit all the time</u>
<u n="803" who="S0018">hm <pause dur="short"/> hm</u>
<u n="804" who="S0019">because I think that's probably a bit of an out of date title</u>
<u n="805" who="S0018">I don't understand all this stuff that's I don't understand the <vocal desc="laugh"/> words that they're using to explain the words that I don't understand</u>
<u n="806" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="807" who="S0019">well it is passed <trunc>fr</trunc> from the Old French feminine past participle of aseeir <pause dur="short"/> sit at</u>
<u n="808" who="S0018">oh?</u>
<u n="809" who="S0019">from the Latin assidere <pause dur="short"/> so there</u>
<u n="810" who="S0018">you learn something new every day don't you</u>
<u n="811" who="S0019">you certainly do <pause dur="short"/> the fact that it'll be forgotten in five minutes <vocal desc="laugh"/> has got nothing to do with it</u>
<u n="812" who="S0018">maybe it would be more informative looking at penal code</u>
<u n="813" who="S0019">well I think the penal code is just the um sort of sentencing for different crimes</u>
<u n="814" who="S0018">oh really?</u>
<u n="815" who="S0019">I think so</u>
<u n="816" who="S0018">it's on how the process of how that is</u>
<u n="817" who="S0019">no</u>
<u n="818" who="S0018">gone about?</u>
<u n="819" who="S0019">no <pause dur="short"/> I don't think so <pause dur="short"/> I mean check it and see <pause dur="short"/> I would be surprised <pause dur="short"/> but it's possible <pause dur="short"/> no I think our er penal code is just the oops is just the the different crimes and how they are treated</u>
<u n="820" who="S0018">yeah like categorizing offences</u>
<u n="821" who="S0019">mm</u>

<u n="824" who="S0018">the the whole judgement process</u>
<u n="825" who="S0019">I suppose you could google the er French judicial system <pause dur="short"/> that would give you some information</u>
<u n="826" who="S0018">ah the judicial system</u>
<u n="827" who="S0019">mhm</u>
