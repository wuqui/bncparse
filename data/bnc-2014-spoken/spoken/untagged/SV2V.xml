<u n="65" who="S0041">I don't even know where <anon type="place"/> is</u>
<u n="66" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> er it's over there</u>
<u n="67" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0084">just like my geography of the North is everything is together up from er here as we discussed</u>
<u n="69" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0084"><trunc>Everyth</trunc> everything is on top of each other about there</u>
<u n="71" who="S0041">yep <pause dur="short"/> I was telling <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> about that</u>
<u n="72" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="73" who="S0084">oh God</u>
<u n="74" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/> And I said to be fair everything from here downwards is London</u>
<u n="75" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="76" who="S0041">so</u>
<u n="77" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="78" who="S0084"><trunc>F</trunc> fair I think</u>
<u n="79" who="S0041">all of it</u>
<u n="80" who="S0084">I think unless you go to these places you have no er I mean even I've been to <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> I've actually been to these</u>
<u n="81" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0084">places</u>
<u n="83" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="84" who="S0084">I've been to <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> and I've <trunc>g</trunc> I couldn't tell you where they are <pause dur="short"/> I was er thinking</u>
<u n="85" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0084">actually if you go there you know er you know where you are <pause dur="short"/> but no <pause dur="short"/> I've no idea <pause dur="short"/> I just got on a train</u>
<u n="87" who="S0041">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think if you drive it you'd probably have move of an idea</u>
<u n="88" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> well I was talking to someone about this <pause dur="short"/> about having a sat nav <pause dur="short"/> and I was saying oh it's so good when I drove to <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> like I know the roads pretty er pretty well from having been with other people up and down</u>
<u n="89" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0084">between <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> or <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> but I'd never driven it myself <pause dur="short"/> and it was really easy <pause dur="short"/> someone else was saying well actually she tries not to use a sat nav cos then she loses any understanding of where she is <pause dur="short"/> like if it breaks</u>
<u n="91" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0084">something went wrong <pause dur="short"/> you'd have no clue <pause dur="short"/> cos you're you're so dependent on it</u>
<u n="93" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> definitely</u>
<u n="94" who="S0084">I suppose that's that is the danger <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>c</trunc> I had the sat nav on my phone when I drove to <anon type="place"/> last week <pause dur="short"/> and I have no idea like if it's east west north south</u>
<u n="95" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="96" who="S0084">not a clue</u>
<u n="97" who="S0041">it's the same way as if you never walk through <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> you only get the tube</u>
<u n="98" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0041">no idea where anything is</u>
<u n="100" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> absolutely <pause dur="short"/> and that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> I mean er I think it's probably just the tourists who end up doing that <pause dur="short"/> because people who actually who know the city know that there's stops in between and that in the middle are all so close together that you can quite easily walk between them</u>
<u n="101" who="S0041">mhm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0084">and it really helps with joining the dots <pause dur="short"/> I think I didn't really get to know <anon type="place"/> until I did that <pause dur="short"/> till I</u>
<u n="103" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="104" who="S0084">till I <trunc>w</trunc> walk through <pause dur="short"/> and I'd have to go and meet my dad somewhere <pause dur="short"/> cos my dad worked in the city for years <pause dur="short"/> and obviously he's a <anon type="place"/> boy</u>
<u n="105" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="106" who="S0084">through and through anyway <pause dur="short"/> so when I was going home from <anon type="place"/> to <anon type="place"/> I'd always stop off <pause dur="short"/> and I'd meet him at <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> we'd go for a little wander and</u>
<u n="107" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="108" who="S0084">then he'd put me on the train from er <anon type="place"/> I think <pause dur="short"/> or <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> so we'd do quite a lot of walking which helps</u>
<u n="109" who="S0041">I can't remember where I've walked to now <pause dur="short"/> I always make a point of walking if it's an option</u>
<u n="110" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0041">but I <trunc>th</trunc> what is that?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0084">that's the freezer I think</u>
<u n="113" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="114" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="115" who="S0084">Don't  know <trunc>d</trunc> don't  know if that really helped <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="116" who="S0041">I think he wants to talk</u>
<u n="117" who="S0084">I think it wants to take off</u>
<u n="118" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="119" who="S0084">I think there might be alien life forms living in there <pause dur="short"/> in fact there probably are <pause dur="short"/> I doubt that's been um defrosted for years</u>
<u n="120" who="S0041">ever</u>
<u n="121" who="S0084">Cos you can barely get anything in it <pause dur="short"/> I think it's only <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that uses it</u>
<u n="122" who="S0041">that's really concerning ain't it <pause dur="short"/> do you think it's gonna explode in the night?</u>
<u n="123" who="S0084">well so long as um we no no one's here <pause dur="short"/> does it normally make that noise? And is it the freezer or the fridge? <vocal desc="laugh"/> Could we go in your room? Cos I'm scared that the freezer's gonna explode</u>
<u n="124" who="S0041">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="125" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="126" who="S0084">I don't want to be in here when the freezer explodes <pause dur="short"/> just if if in doubt we didn't touch the freezer</u>
<u n="127" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> we didn't touch it</u>

Like find a three-bed place</u>
<u n="443" who="S0041">yep</u>
<u n="444" who="S0084">and I thought even though I like them I've lived with lived as one of three girls before and the two girls fell out and I was piggy in the middle <pause dur="short"/> and it was horrendous <pause dur="short"/> fff <pause dur="short"/> and I just didn't want that to happen again <pause dur="short"/> and also er just I'm just not sure</u>
<u n="445" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="446" who="S0084">they're very very close <pause dur="short"/> and you'd be the person coming in <pause dur="short"/> and you might disturb that</u>

<u n="448" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="449" who="S0041">and you go home with them that could get really too much <pause dur="short"/> like</u>
<u n="450" who="S0084">tut <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="451" who="S0041">I did it with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> for three months solid <pause dur="short"/> and we both said like we really lived in each other's pockets <pause dur="short"/> it was so difficult because we were working all day while I was her manager</u>
<u n="452" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="453" who="S0041">and there was only sometimes there was just the two of us <pause dur="short"/> so sometimes she really had to take direct orders</u>
<u n="454" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="455" who="S0041">and I had to tell her off and stuff <pause dur="short"/> and <trunc>w</trunc> we took her on knowing that if she was gonna get fired I was gonna have to fire her</u>
<u n="456" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="457" who="S0041">so that was quite stretched sometimes <pause dur="short"/> especially if she she made a mistake or not just a normal error but if something was serious</u>
<u n="458" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="459" who="S0041">um <pause dur="short"/> but we managed it fine <pause dur="short"/> completely fine <pause dur="short"/> to the point where the MD was like a bit worried about saying something to her and I was like why? Well I know that she's your friend <pause dur="short"/> and I was like bullshit</u>
<u n="460" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="461" who="S0041">we both had made such a point to keep it so professional</u>
<u n="462" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="463" who="S0041">there's no way you could've pulled that string <pause dur="short"/> I was like absolute bullshit</u>
<u n="464" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="465" who="S0041">Cos our desks were joined onto his</u>
<u n="466" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="467" who="S0041">Cos we had a separate office to everyone else</u>
<u n="468" who="S0084">oh okay</u>
<u n="469" who="S0041">and so it was blatant lies <pause dur="short"/> he was <trunc>bla</trunc> he was just being a coward</u>
<u n="470" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="471" who="S0041">and then we were living in <anon type="place"/> Monday to Friday</u>
<u n="472" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="473" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Literally a pull up bed and an air bed in the living room of a three bed flat <pause dur="short"/> cos we didn't want to heat up the whole place <pause dur="short"/> cos it would've been freezing the whole time <pause dur="short"/> cos it was middle of winter <pause dur="short"/> it was snow on the ground <pause dur="short"/> living on like salad and beans <pause dur="short"/> eating nothing</u>
<u n="474" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="475" who="S0041">Cos we were slimming <pause dur="short"/> and then driving home at the weekend <pause dur="short"/> which she was then sharing with me and <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> <pause dur="short"/> which was rocky</u>
<u n="476" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="477" who="S0041">so it was really the most stressful</u>
<u n="478" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="479" who="S0041">possible situation imaginable</u>
<u n="480" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="481" who="S0041">and we were with each other twenty-four seven <pause dur="short"/> and we still didn't fall out</u>
<u n="482" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's a real test of the friendship definitely</u>
<u n="483" who="S0041">and I said to <unclear/> like how much more stressful could this be?</u>
<u n="484" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="485" who="S0041">really <pause dur="short"/> and we're still not falling out and getting angry with each other</u>
<u n="486" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="487" who="S0041">and not getting pissed off <pause dur="short"/> and I wasn't looking forward to the day she left</u>
<u n="488" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="489" who="S0041">but then I think if you work with someone that you don't really know <pause dur="short"/> like I knew when I took her on</u>
<u n="490" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="491" who="S0041">I was we were still worried <pause dur="short"/> the pair of us were a bit concerned that it might just make us fall out</u>
<u n="492" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="493" who="S0041">I think if there's um any doubt don't do it</u>
<u n="494" who="S0084">well absolutely <pause dur="short"/> and that you know that's why I didn't <pause dur="short"/> er we do work in the same office <pause dur="short"/> you know with her and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> the three of us all work at the Press but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> works in the other building <pause dur="short"/> works for a different department <pause dur="short"/> and is very er <trunc>d</trunc> in like a completely different business stream <pause dur="short"/> she's IT</u>
<u n="495" who="S0041">oh right <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="496" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> and they there's three business streams <pause dur="short"/> there's ELT <pause dur="short"/> er the English language teaching <trunc>s</trunc> which is where I work <pause dur="short"/> there's journals <pause dur="short"/> and then there's academic and professional <pause dur="short"/> and the IT department supports all three of those business streams</u>
<u n="497" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="498" who="S0084">so it's very separate <pause dur="short"/> so we're supported by their team but we don't er really work together</u>
<u n="499" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="500" who="S0084">generally speaking <pause dur="short"/> they they deal with the systems that we use</u>
<u n="501" who="S0041">they're helpers</u>
<u n="502" who="S0084">they're the helpers <pause dur="short"/> they're the people who work behind the scenes <pause dur="short"/> so we don't really er have much day to day interaction with them <pause dur="short"/> so that's why it works for them</u>
<u n="503" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="504" who="S0084">because they have enough common interests in their their industry in terms of their work and what they can talk about <pause dur="short"/> but it's very different to when they come home and they can just</u>
<u n="505" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="506" who="S0084">I mean I I would hope that they don't actually talk about work <pause dur="short"/> cos it would be really really boring</u>
<u n="507" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="508" who="S0084">Cos you'd be at work all day and then you'd be coming home and talk about work <pause dur="short"/> and it would be really easy to spend your entire life talking about work</u>
<u n="509" who="S0041">work</u>
<u n="510" who="S0084">that'd be</u>
<u n="511" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="512" who="S0084">my worry <pause dur="short"/> I don't want to <pause dur="short"/> I mean I very rarely</u>
<u n="513" who="S0041">it'll just take over</u>
<u n="514" who="S0084">do <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I very rarely do actually I think <pause dur="short"/> I don't think I talk about work that much</u>
<u n="515" who="S0041">no not not at all <pause dur="short"/> I think the only time work comes up is when it's a relationship within that environment</u>
<u n="516" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="517" who="S0041">or an event within that environment</u>
<u n="518" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="519" who="S0041">in which case it doesn't really matter that it's at work cos it could be  it could be  anywhere</u>

<u n="527" who="S0041">that's good</u>
<u n="528" who="S0084">it's quite quite encouraging <pause dur="short"/> I think it just probably means that I'm quite settled I suppose</u>
<u n="529" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="530" who="S0084">but it's I think also it's just very I dunno <pause dur="short"/> it's not customer-facing <pause dur="short"/> so you don't have that you'll never guess what happened with this person who came in</u>
<u n="531" who="S0041"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="1243" who="S0041">oh God</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0084">you can be extended to two years <pause dur="short"/> and then after that you can apply for citizenship by asking your your company to sponsor you <pause dur="short"/> which is what she's done <pause dur="short"/> but rural work <pause dur="short"/> when she worked there</u>

<u n="1249" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0084">they wouldn't send the helicopter ambulance out <pause dur="short"/> because they said oh er we don't think it's that much of an emergency <pause dur="short"/> and she said that's very interesting but I possibly having internal bleeding right now <pause dur="short"/> I can't stand on my foot <pause dur="short"/> I'm in excruciating pain <pause dur="short"/> ff yeah well the flying doctor can't come to you until tomorrow <pause dur="short"/> so can you just like bandage it and elevate it?

<u n="1254" who="S0084">someone can come and get you if something bad <trunc>c</trunc> bad happens <pause dur="short"/> but yeah that's that's what you have to do <pause dur="short"/> you have to do your rural work if you want to stay for an extra year <pause dur="short"/> which is an <trunc>in</trunc> a good way of doing it if you if there's an industry that you're you can't get employees for</u>
<u n="1255" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="1256" who="S0084">but it's a bit harsh <pause dur="short"/> like it's quite  quite a quite  a way of doing it</u>
<u n="1257" who="S0041">work on a farm</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0084">but this so yeah the going back to the point about the road signs <pause dur="short"/> this is  this is  the UK and er at the moment er er the language of the country is English</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0041">mm</u>

<u n="1271" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1272" who="S0084">but certainly with the um migration of Muslims coming here <pause dur="short"/> could be that that's that's what becomes our</u>

<u n="1275" who="S0041"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1276" who="S0084">I don't really agree with that <pause dur="short"/> I think just let people migrate the way they want to <pause dur="short"/> well and that would help the situation between having a really rich West and a really poor East</u>
<u n="1277" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> if people can move as they want</u>
<u n="1278" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1279" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it would</u>
<u n="1280" who="S0084">and that's why they don't want them to <pause dur="short"/> cos it's very easy to have poor Africans</u>
<u n="1281" who="S0041">yep <pause dur="short"/> although I do think that everywhere should be like France with its er er huh what's the English word? Er maybe we don't have a word <pause dur="short"/> like religion freeness</u>
<u n="1282" who="S0084">tut <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> we're a secular state <pause dur="short"/> we don't unless you go to a religious school <pause dur="short"/> like a Catholic school <pause dur="short"/> you're not taught about religion <pause dur="short"/> you er do you mean like having a religious <trunc>m</trunc> <trunc>religiou</trunc></u>
<u n="1283" who="S0041">no er</u>
<u n="1284" who="S0084">religion separate to <trunc>s</trunc> to the state?</u>
<u n="1285" who="S0041">I mean they have a thing where in any school any government any it's anybody employed by the government <pause dur="short"/> so police teachers all that shabaz</u>
<u n="1286" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1287" who="S0041">any school <pause dur="short"/> they're not allowed to show their religion <pause dur="short"/> so no turbans <pause dur="short"/> no crosses</u>

<u n="1299" who="S0041">ah</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0084">they they're so well it's really difficult actually isn't it <pause dur="short"/> because obviously in the South they're a real Bible Belt <pause dur="short"/> but they wanted to keep religion separate to the state <pause dur="short"/> but I think in actual fact because so many of the like the um senators and the governors obviously the South is very strong</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="1302" who="S0084">they're quite religious <pause dur="short"/> so I think they actually have quite an impact <pause dur="short"/> because you've got this friction between state law and federal law <pause dur="short"/> so the law that relates to the country as a whole and laws that relate to just a state <pause dur="short"/> I think talking to an American person recently they were saying that they don't imagine that the USA will stay united</u>
<u n="1303" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="1304" who="S0084">because laws that are <trunc>rela</trunc> that relative to New York for example are completely different to laws that relate to Texas <pause dur="short"/> like obviously in Texas they've still got capital punishment <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> they've got the highest</u>

<u n="1308" who="S0084">you know <pause dur="short"/> they still  they still  execute people on a  on a  monthly basis <pause dur="short"/> and to New Yorkers it's er barbaric <pause dur="short"/> completely different mindset <pause dur="short"/> completely different culture <pause dur="short"/> and if you think in terms of miles how far away it is <pause dur="short"/> it'd be like someone in England comparing themselves to someone in Romania <pause dur="short"/> the</u>
<u n="1309" who="S0041">that far away?</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0084">that's how far away it is <pause dur="short"/> america's</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0041">what?</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0084">massive <pause dur="short"/> like er yeah <pause dur="short"/> maybe not Romania</u>
<u n="1313" who="S0041">I suppose you see it on the map <pause dur="short"/> and it is actually the full length isn't it</u>
<u n="1314" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> if you think Texas is right at the bottom in the middle <pause dur="short"/> and New York is right up there on the East Coast</u>
<u n="1315" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0084">it's really far</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0041">Jesus</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0084">it's like  it's like  its er its own continent essentially is probably what's</u>
<u n="1319" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1320" who="S0084">gonna happen</u>
<u n="1321" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> definitely</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0084">Cos you just can't  you just can't  create laws for all of them <pause dur="short"/> they won't come in line</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0041">what do you mean its own continent?</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0084">if you think about the USA er um and compare it to Europe</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0084">for example <pause dur="short"/> so that's probably what would happen <pause dur="short"/> it would become a continent as opposed to a country <pause dur="short"/> and each of the states would be its own country</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0041">so what's continent is America in?</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0084">it's North <trunc>Amer</trunc> it's North America <pause dur="short"/> so er USA and Canada is its own continent <pause dur="short"/> then you've got</u>
