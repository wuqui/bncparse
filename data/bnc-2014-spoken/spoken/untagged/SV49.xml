<u n="1" who="S0119">okay we're recording now <pause dur="short"/> cos is it is that okay if we put that in the start of the recording?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0173">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="3" who="S0054">can can your voice be picked up?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0119">yes because I can see the wave form</u>
<u n="5" who="S0054">eh okay</u>
<u n="6" who="S0119">I seem to have a very distinctive voice <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm picking up on microphone</u>
<u n="7" who="S0173">oh that's good <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> em I think you should tell us about last night <trunc>bec</trunc> about the em comedy and how em it was received by I'm sure you went to the bar afterwards</u>
<u n="8" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0173">how well it was received by people in the bar</u>
<u n="10" who="S0054">em it well it seemed to have gone down quite well <pause dur="short"/> em which was pleasing <pause dur="short"/> em but eh yeah the audience wasn't as big as we normally have for those gigs em largely because eh a Sunday night is a very big social night for students <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="11" who="S0173">yes <pause dur="short"/> I saw lots of people wearing gowns and suits and things and I thought isn't that a bit strange on a Sunday? Because obviously well I know it's student life <vocal desc="laugh"/> but still</u>
<u n="12" who="S0054" trans="overlap">yeah it was a it was a a formal night <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0119">I thought there was a formal going on wasn't there or something?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0054">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>si</trunc> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is always <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> always has a formal on Sundays</u>
<u n="15" who="S0119">they always have suits on no matter when</u>
<u n="16" who="S0054">yeah <pause dur="short"/> just everyone</u>
<u n="17" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="18" who="S0054">em and eh <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's just in general just the the culture is that Sunday is a big big night like there are various big club nights and stuff so em it's just a thing across the entire university that Sunday is is a big social night <pause dur="short"/> and this is the last Sunday of the term so</u>
<u n="19" who="S0173">oh yeah it's true everything's happening this week</u>
<u n="20" who="S0054">em <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0119">does that mean that any lecturer doesn't actually you know like want to schedule a lecture for nine AM or what on Monday?</u>
<u n="22" who="S0054">oh no they if anything they're gaining pleasure from doing so</u>
<u n="23" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="24" who="S0119">welcome to torture <pause dur="short"/> I mean maths one O the three I mean torture</u>
<u n="25" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0173">yeah because usually wouldn't there be some kind of like you know major deadline <vocal desc="laugh"/> in the last week of term</u>
<u n="27" who="S0054">yeah the thing is it just varies from person to person not even from subject to subject like <pause dur="short"/> em some people end up having far too much to do at the end of term <pause dur="short"/> other people can have like a real ease down like em I remember sometimes for me I had like a everything would sort of amass around the seventh week of term and then the eighth week I was just sitting there going well everything I have to do now I have until May to do <vocal desc="laugh"/> so em</u>
<u n="28" who="S0173">yeah and then Easter holidays used to happen and then everyone goes home and</u>
<u n="29" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0173">presumably does no work or so they do <trunc>lo</trunc> lots of work <pause dur="short"/> I think I heard that Cambridge students actually have to work loads in the holiday?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0054">oh god yeah <pause dur="short"/> em I mean I mean we all have to so about half of us do <vocal desc="laugh"/> Em</u>
<u n="32" who="S0119">wait a minute</u>
<u n="33" who="S0173">everyone else goes skiing</u>
<u n="34" who="S0054">em yeah <pause dur="short"/> probably I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I've never being skiing <pause dur="short"/> I'm not rich enough</u>
<u n="35" who="S0173">mm <pause dur="short"/> I went once <pause dur="short"/> I wasn't rich enough <pause dur="short"/> I didn't realise how much it was gonna cost like I paid sort of the upfront price but of course <vocal desc="cough"/> excuse me</u>
<u n="36" who="S0119">that should be transcribed as cough cough cough</u>
<u n="37" who="S0173">wasabi pea</u>
<u n="38" who="S0069" trans="overlap">wasabi pea</u>
<u n="39" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="40" who="S0173">em yeah I I think it was like this was about six years ago <pause dur="short"/> in fact it was around the time I got my laptop em and I</u>
<u n="41" who="S0119">so you took it skiing and that's why it's so slow</u>
<u n="42" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="43" who="S0119">it couldn't handle the cold and it's never recovered</u>
<u n="44" who="S0173">that could be it <pause dur="short"/> actually I I think I got it just after I went skiing em I don't know how because I would have had no money at all</u>
<u n="45" who="S0119">I just spent my money let's spend more <pause dur="short"/> brilliant</u>
<u n="46" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was really really necessary cos my previous laptop screen stopped working <pause dur="short"/> everything else worked fine but the back light stopped working</u>
<u n="47" who="S0119">oh</u>
<u n="48" who="S0054">ah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0173">so I couldn't actually see everything that was on the screen which was not useful <pause dur="short"/> but anyway so I went skiing and paid like four or five hundred pounds upfront which I thought was a lot for a week but still</u>
<u n="50" who="S0054">mm hm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0173">okayish <pause dur="short"/> like cos I really wanted to go skiing <pause dur="short"/> and then I got there there was like the ski pass lift pass something pass</u>
<u n="52" who="S0119">lift pass yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0173">yeah and that was another hundred and then there was sort of like paying for food and the entertainment and they were really expensive like bars and places</u>
<u n="54" who="S0069">where did you go?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0173">oh was it La Plagne La Plagne in France I think <pause dur="short"/> em somewhere French definitely <pause dur="short"/> and I went with people who had been skiing <pause dur="short"/> like one of my friends was a snowboarder he was amazing</u>
<u n="56" who="S0119">they they kind of knew about all these hidden costs to begin with so like yeah of course you pay a hundred dollars for a lift pass</u>
<u n="57" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0119">of course you do that</u>
<u n="59" who="S0054">you just You just leak money when skiing</u>
<u n="60" who="S0173">that's the thing</u>
<u n="61" who="S0119">I mean it's the thing that like you're in a ski resort is not like a metropolitan area or attached or anything cos it's in the <trunc>mi</trunc> a frigging mountain area</u>
<u n="62" who="S0173">and so they can charge what they want</u>
<u n="63" who="S0119">exactly</u>
<u n="64" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0119">it's like it's like it's like being in a very extended airport but with more white and better maintained</u>
<u n="67" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0173">basically there was a lot of white</u>
<u n="69" who="S0119" trans="overlap">less less hobos</u>
<u n="70" who="S0173">yes there was definitely a lot of white and also cos you're doing so much skiing you're using energy all day so you're so hungry all the time <pause dur="short"/> so you have to buy enormous quantities of food to like keep going</u>
<u n="71" who="S0054" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0069" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0119">that sounds delicious</u>
<u n="74" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="75" who="S0173">it's amazing <pause dur="short"/> it's like a license to eat cheese and chocolate mm fondue</u>
<u n="76" who="S0054">do you you need a license for that now <unclear/> This has got draconian</u>
<u n="77" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="78" who="S0119">well you see you buy you buy the gold lift pass and then you get on to the lift and all of a sudden a pot of like fondue and a steak appear</u>
<u n="79" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="80" who="S0173">that would be amazing that might be a business idea</u>
<u n="81" who="S0069" trans="overlap">so cool</u>
<u n="82" who="S0119">what did you have for breakfast?</u>
<event desc="unintelligible"/>
<u n="83" who="S0054">I really hope that goes into textbook that's</u>
<u n="84" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="86" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="87" who="S0119">twenty-one day aged beef and you sort of get it and it's got a picture of Jamie Oliver winking on it and it's like nurgh</u>
<u n="88" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="89" who="S0173">that's enough to put you off your food</u>
<u n="90" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="91" who="S0119" trans="overlap">yeah you think <pause dur="short"/> it's actually it's actually they've actually had to put ordinances out because people just throw them at skiers going past <pause dur="short"/> it's like <trunc>di</trunc> it's like pigeons that dive bomb you when you're on the <trunc>str</trunc> on the side walk</u>
<u n="92" who="S0173">I wish that had happened to me <pause dur="short"/> it didn't happen to me</u>
<u n="93" who="S0119">what pigeon dive bomb you?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0173">well not the pigeon part but the food</u>
<u n="95" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0173">but all that ended up happening was that I em didn't know how to ski which obviously would have happened and as it was my first time and the first step was like sliding down a mountain for about fifty metres backwards going uuuaarh</u>
<u n="97" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="98" who="S0173">to my friend who was at the top and couldn't help me</u>
<u n="99" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="100" who="S0173">em yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0119">was there some sort of just very large shrug of like oh I don't know</u>
<u n="102" who="S0173">well basically I just didn't think I was ever going to stop</u>
<u n="103" who="S0054">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think I think skiing is a gift to slapstick <pause dur="short"/> but em</u>
<u n="104" who="S0173">yes</u>
<u n="105" who="S0054">it's it's not not so great for you know personal health em</u>
<u n="106" who="S0173">that's the thing and you could so easily like break your leg or die <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="107" who="S0119">I like I like how those are two options it's either like well you can break your leg or you can just flat out corpse on the on the slope</u>
<u n="108" who="S0054">well I have put off the idea of skiing at all because em someone I know eh sudden well I mean I I don't know her well enough but it's on on Facebook just eh she sort of vanished for a bit and then came back em okay it's fine everyone em I I I've been flown back back to the hospital in Ireland so I'm well enough that's alright and then just posting up all the pictures of the metal which is now in her spine</u>
<u n="109" who="S0173">ooh god</u>

<u n="113" who="S0054" trans="overlap">yeah I'm <pause dur="short"/> I'm okay with not going skiing because the expensive thing and the whole breaking the back thing totally up for avoiding that</u>
<u n="114" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and the cold <pause dur="short"/> I mean okay you've got like ski jackets and stuff but it's still freezing</u>
<u n="115" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0119">it's the reason why all the sort of like the pictures of ski resorts have giant roaring fires it's like must keep the cold out somehow</u>
<u n="118" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah the evening part of skiing looks great</u>
<u n="119" who="S0054">the après ski</u>
<u n="120" who="S0173">exactly</u>
<u n="121" who="S0119">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it's it's it's good just to be like around <pause dur="short"/> like you don't want the actual it's like</u>
<u n="122" who="S0173">some people do that though <pause dur="short"/> like people's often people's wives or girlfriends or maybe husbands too I don't know <pause dur="short"/> they go and they like just stay in the chalet and they don't actually ski</u>
<u n="123" who="S0069">yeah I do that</u>
<u n="124" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0069">have a sauna <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0054">yeah there is there there is the whole thing about people who go skiing just for the après ski</u>
<u n="127" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0119">skiing posers</u>
<u n="129" who="S0173">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="130" who="S0119">mind you I could say the exact same happen thing happened my dad was heavily into scuba diving and like you'd often like we got dragged along cos it was a tropical island in the Caribbean <pause dur="short"/> and we were seduced</u>
<u n="131" who="S0173"><vocal desc="laugh"/> You're not going to say no</u>
<u n="132" who="S0054" trans="overlap">I like how you said dragged along</u>
<u n="133" who="S0119">well it was because it it it's exceedingly tedious and I was a bit of a dumb kid so it's like yeah why am I here? </u>
<u n="134" who="S0173">I suppose if you're a kid it's not</u>
<u n="135" who="S0119">well it's like what's there to do it's like my parent were like or you can sunbathe I was like I don't give a fuck <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> So oops shit eh damn it <pause dur="short"/> eh</u>
<u n="136" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="137" who="S0119">breaking the no swearing rule</u>
<u n="138" who="S0173"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> your use of the English language is colourful</u>
<u n="139" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="140" who="S0119">ah it's very nice they dragged you dragged dragged to a Caribbean Island it was on it was on a massive discount because it was the last person last minute sort of drop out and they needed to fill the space with like anyone who would be able to pay the half rate <pause dur="short"/> so we managed to get going to this Caribbean Island for</u>
<u n="141" who="S0054">right</u>
<u n="142" who="S0119">my dad do skiing my dad not skiing skiing on the water <pause dur="short"/> but no went scuba diving and so I was kind of left on the shore but it was the sort of thing where like that one or four or half of the group of not more were just there because they were dragged along</u>
<u n="143" who="S0054" trans="overlap">because <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0119">and em they didn't want to be away and also it was a good excuse to have a reduced rate sort of fly out there while other people went <trunc>sc</trunc> went scuba diving you just went and faffed around</u>
<u n="145" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0119">em on shore <pause dur="short"/> and then basically yeah <pause dur="short"/> quite a lot of people were there with the <trunc>a</trunc> with the <trunc>mi</trunc> for the first day they were very happy with it then the second day they learnt that scuba diving includes a lot of like tidying up after people and quietly got hacked off about the whole thing</u>
<u n="147" who="S0054">mm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0119">because scuba divers would come back dump a load of wet gear on them and say here you can sort this out? and it's like no what are you doing? And then scuba divers would then go into the pub and get drunk <pause dur="short"/> so then they'd be no good to go till the next day <pause dur="short"/> when they'd get their kit back on and went back underneath the waves</u>
<u n="149" who="S0173">that sounds like such a bad idea <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>scu</trunc> scuba diving when you're hung-over <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="150" who="S0119">well enough of them did it so</u>
<u n="151" who="S0054">better than scuba diving when drunk?</u>
<u n="152" who="S0173">well arguably</u>
<u n="153" who="S0119">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well actually the worst thing you can do and it's arguably worse than being absolutely slaughtered out of your mind is when you go scuba diving with an ear infection because you rely on your balance <pause dur="short"/> so going scuba diving with this ear infection you basically don't know your depth or your orientation <pause dur="short"/> and you can basically do the whole thing of like swimming like think you're swimming up but you're going down <pause dur="short"/> and end up kind of like putting yourself into way deep pressure</u>
<u n="154" who="S0173">ooh</u>
<u n="155" who="S0119">it's kind of like messed up the things that can happen to you scuba diving</u>
<u n="156" who="S0173">that's really weird</u>
<u n="157" who="S0054">now I've been put off going scuba diving <pause dur="short"/> this is This is actually making my list of things to do before I die a lot shorter</u>
<u n="158" who="S0173">so let's let's talk about sky diving</u>
<u n="159" who="S0069">yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="161" who="S0119">that's actually that cos the thing is sky diving is the most dangerous sort of sporting activity and scuba diving's the second</u>
<u n="162" who="S0173">really?</u>
<u n="163" who="S0069">really?</u>
<u n="164" who="S0119">yeah <pause dur="short"/> like if according to insurance lists</u>
<u n="165" who="S0173">what about bull fighting?</u>
<u n="166" who="S0119">that's not really to be considered a leisure activity</u>

<u n="398" who="S0173">I did know what it did at one point <vocal desc="laugh"/> I think it was during my educate myself about science phase</u>
<u n="399" who="S0054">I think that that guy had some really really good lines</u>
<u n="400" who="S0173">mm <pause dur="short"/> I kind of liked his style <pause dur="short"/> like the way he was quite laid back about it</u>
<u n="401" who="S0054">mm</u>
<u n="402" who="S0173">and you weren't sure <pause dur="short"/> at first you were like was that a joke? Like oh that's really funny and</u>
<u n="403" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="404" who="S0173">it slowly dawned on you <pause dur="short"/> so it was like slow speed comedy</u>
<u n="405" who="S0054">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's em I was worried about I didn't actually want to put him on last <pause dur="short"/> it's a it was a bit of a risk because it's the sort of sort of material which if the audience decides that they like it they will love it</u>
<u n="406" who="S0173">and end on a good note</u>
<u n="407" who="S0054">yeah <pause dur="short"/> whereas and it will be the highlight em but if it's if if the audience approach it like the first couple of jokes with eh maybe then they're lost</u>
<u n="408" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="409" who="S0054">it's a lost cause and the whole thing will die em <pause dur="short"/> I actually wanted the guy who ended the first half <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> the guy who started on the phone bit</u>
<u n="410" who="S0173">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="411" who="S0054">which I loved that</u>
<u n="412" who="S0119">he really <trunc>ac</trunc> he really acted the whole thing</u>
<u n="413" who="S0173">he was really good yeah</u>
<u n="414" who="S0054">no indiscriminately</u>
<u n="415" who="S0069">Cos he was there was such a different like they were all such different styles</u>
<u n="416" who="S0054">mm</u>
<u n="417" who="S0069">like he would so he clearly thought about everything he was going to say and like he or that was just almost just his style</u>
<u n="418" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="419" who="S0069">like his personality <pause dur="short"/> he just like he wouldn't sort of stutter or anything like that <pause dur="short"/> em whereas some of them were much more like high energy and sort of rushing around</u>
<u n="420" who="S0054">yeah <pause dur="short"/> richard the one with the purple hair <pause dur="short"/> he's very high energy</u>
<u n="421" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="422" who="S0119">he's very purple hair and he</u>
<u n="423" who="S0173">he's very in the air</u>
<u n="424" who="S0054">he is and he's he's very difficult to calm down and actually like he he he'll he'll do a set and you go okay well that that was good but you know and you give some feedback and say well this bit eh dragged on this bit you could have delivered funnier that kind of thing and he'll take it all on board and then not act on any of it</u>
<u n="425" who="S0119">oh no</u>
<u n="426" who="S0054">and he doesn't realise he's not acting on any of it because when he's onstage he's essentially just being him but to</u>
<u n="427" who="S0173">but more extreme <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="428" who="S0054" trans="overlap">or not even more extreme just he's actually almost trying to tone himself down <pause dur="short"/> because if were up there just being himself he would abandon the script and just rant about whatever the hell <pause dur="short"/> not even rant that makes him sound angry <pause dur="short"/> just rabbit on <pause dur="short"/> em so it's like he's trying to tone down his own em craziness <pause dur="short"/> but as a result he he still kind of faffs around but not in a funny way <pause dur="short"/> and so you tell him not to do that and he doesn't realise when he's doing it <pause dur="short"/> it's eh</u>
<u n="429" who="S0173">so is he actually funnier when he's just being himself?</u>
<u n="430" who="S0054">em yes</u>
<u n="431" who="S0173">so so but he's still not</u>
<u n="432" who="S0054">he's actually a lot funnier not on stage</u>
<u n="433" who="S0119">that's must be that's a really weird conundrum to have</u>
<u n="434" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="435" who="S0069">yeah</u>
<u n="436" who="S0173">but no isn't that the issue with stand-up comedians? There are some who are like have really good lines <pause dur="short"/> and they're polished <pause dur="short"/> and then there are some who are just naturally hilarious people</u>
<u n="437" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="438" who="S0069">yeah</u>
<u n="439" who="S0173">and like everyone falls into one of those categories</u>
<u n="440" who="S0054">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's some comedians are famously really unfunny just as people like John Cleese apparently like just like a really boring person to be around</u>
<u n="441" who="S0119">he's a miserable sod</u>
<u n="442" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I heard that he is miserable</u>
<u n="443" who="S0054" trans="overlap">and he's not funny at all <pause dur="short"/> em and he I I'm not very certain but I I have a deep suspicion that Dylan Moran is the same</u>
<u n="444" who="S0173">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="445" who="S0119">yes Dylan Moran Dylan Moran I <trunc>m</trunc> I I'm I meant to <unclear/> But he seems to have a series of masks he can put on</u>
<u n="446" who="S0054">mm</u>
<u n="447" who="S0119">like he can put on his sort of act mask <pause dur="short"/> then he also has another mask of I am out of an act but I'm still on <pause dur="short"/> like if you ever see em one of his I think it's Monster he has like a bit where he's being interviewed in his dressing room</u>
<u n="448" who="S0054">oh yeah</u>
<u n="449" who="S0119">but it's kind of a level beyond his actual stand-up in front of the camera where he's like he's he's got another mask over his visual one <pause dur="short"/> so it's like he's putting on two different fronts and then it like cycles that <pause dur="short"/> it's very surreal to watch</u>
<u n="450" who="S0054">well yeah what what what he's doing is in in the context where normally that would be seeing behind the mask and seeing what he's what he's really like and what he's doing is pretending that but actually it's a different mask</u>
<u n="451" who="S0119">yeah</u>
<u n="452" who="S0054">so yeah</u>
<u n="453" who="S0119">it's like an it's like an additional <trunc>ps</trunc> it's like a additional sort of sub persona</u>
<u n="454" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="455" who="S0119">on top of what he's already doing</u>
<u n="456" who="S0054">which is trying to emphasise his onstage persona</u>
<u n="457" who="S0119">yeah which is kind of crazy</u>
<u n="458" who="S0173" trans="overlap">see yeah I don't like there's too many masks too many personas like he just keep it simple</u>
<u n="459" who="S0119">but he's still a funny man</u>
<u n="460" who="S0069">yeah</u>
<u n="461" who="S0054">my favourite comedians and they're the ones I essentially try to be like are the ones who come across onstage as being really genuine as as though they are just like people like Dara O'Briain and Ed Byrne <pause dur="short"/> em people who <trunc>y</trunc> you watch them and you feel like it was almost just a conversation with them in the pub <pause dur="short"/> admittedly a very one-sided one but like they are just talking because they enjoy talking to you</u>
<u n="462" who="S0173" trans="overlap">talking yeah</u>
<u n="463" who="UNKMALE" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="464" who="S0054">as opposed to they're doing a performance <pause dur="short"/> em and that's what I kind of go for</u>
<u n="465" who="S0173">did you see that thing about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> meeting Dara O'Briain</u>
<u n="466" who="S0069">yeah it was weird</u>
<u n="467" who="S0054" trans="overlap">yeah I was just going to say</u>
<u n="468" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> our friend met Dara O'Briain she went</u>
<u n="469" who="S0069">in the pub? In the Isle of Man?</u>
<u n="470" who="S0173">with her friend and who was like Oh Dara's just texted me <pause dur="short"/> he's coming down <pause dur="short"/> We have no further details than that</u>
<u n="471" who="S0069">yeah and then it was like go she got back from the pub and then she said something like oh yeah I was at the pub with my friend like my friend <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> no was that <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>? I don't know</u>
<u n="472" who="S0173">I think it was a different <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> I think it was work <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> whoever she is</u>
<u n="473" who="S0069">right <pause dur="short"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> friend Dara came along from Mock the Week and was like oh</u>
<u n="474" who="S0054">wow</u>
<u n="475" who="S0173">the Isle of Man?</u>
<u n="476" who="S0054">the Isle of Man yeah <pause dur="short"/> well this is it</u>
<u n="477" who="S0119">he he goes there to get away <pause dur="short"/> like you know he goes to Ireland he gets mobbed</u>
<u n="478" who="S0069">maybe he was doing it surely</u>
<u n="479" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="480" who="S0054">it's always interesting to notice so you're basically two links away from Dara O'Briain or are you three?</u>
<u n="481" who="S0173">two well if she's met him two</u>
<u n="482" who="S0054">well is it meet or know well?</u>
<u n="483" who="S0069">she's probably scared him off</u>
<u n="484" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="485" who="S0069">that works quite a lot</u>
<u n="486" who="S0054">A friend of mine met Dara O'Briain just like he was just walking around a market I think and went you're Dara O'Briain and he went yes </u>
<u n="487" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="488" who="S0054">and <pause dur="short"/> they</u>
<u n="489" who="S0173">and that was it</u>
<u n="490" who="S0054">and had a photo taken with him and that was it <pause dur="short"/> apparently he's he's a really nice guy</u>
<u n="491" who="S0173">I can imagine yeah</u>
<u n="492" who="S0119">he does seem really likeable</u>
<u n="493" who="S0054">and you really do get the impression partly because he does so much improv in his shows you really do get the impression that that is just him having fun</u>
<u n="494" who="S0173">yeah he's very natural</u>
<u n="495" who="S0054">as opposed to him performing</u>
<u n="496" who="S0069">yeah</u>
<u n="497" who="S0119">I mean I I've seen Ed Byrne before actually in the Corn Exchange</u>
<u n="498" who="S0054">oh yeah</u>
<u n="499" who="S0119">and it was basically an extended pub conversation</u>
<u n="500" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="501" who="S0119">like he was wearing sort of like you know he did a lot of hand motion and obviously this can't be transcribed but like hand motions out to the audience</u>
<u n="502" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="503" who="S0119">like he was very sort of like and you and you and you and he'd sort of like go around and be very sort of like open and carry on em until he caught someone taking a video of the</u>
<u n="504" who="S0054">yeah and then he ended up <unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="505" who="S0119">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I told you about this before <pause dur="short"/> ooh it was so embarrassing</u>
<u n="506" who="S0173">oh no</u>
<u n="507" who="S0119">but yeah I felt really bad for him but at the same time I was like ah you're derailing your own show so eh</u>
<u n="508" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="509" who="S0173">so he just started ranting?</u>
<u n="510" who="S0119">he did he did he started ranting he was like ah <unclear/> selling DVDs as well I'm on YouTube ah I it's oh god like don't go that mad <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="511" who="S0173">but he must be relatively successful so why is he?</u>
<u n="512" who="S0119">I know <pause dur="short"/> he seems to think he's not from his own mention of his own show he seems to think he's not</u>
<u n="513" who="S0173">mm strange</u>
<u n="514" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="515" who="S0119">yeah <pause dur="short"/> pretty embarrassing</u>
<u n="516" who="S0054">and that is that is such a shame <pause dur="short"/> because em <pause dur="short"/> also I <trunc>d</trunc> I don't think that's much of a like phone videos on YouTube <pause dur="short"/> awful to watch</u>
<u n="517" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="518" who="S0119">yeah but the thing the thing is that most</u>
<u n="519" who="S0054" trans="overlap">like <trunc>no</trunc> nobody enjoys watching them</u>
<u n="520" who="S0119">well the thing is that people</u>
<u n="521" who="S0173">the the problem is actually people uploading the professionally recorded things onto You Tube</u>
<u n="522" who="S0119">oh yeah</u>
<u n="523" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="524" who="S0054">that's really the issue</u>
<u n="525" who="S0119">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but also it's the fact that I mean the the thing is though you can say that they're awful but the thing is YouTube especially seeing as the early days especially in the early days of YouTube when it was like three sixty P or nothing or two forty P</u>
<u n="526" who="S0054">yeah</u>
<u n="527" who="S0119">which is garbage to look at like two forty by one sixty video is like looking at a tea stain and saying oh yeah it's the Clangers <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="528" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="529" who="S0054">eh that's <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> metaphor</u>
<u n="530" who="S0119">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="531" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="532" who="S0054">wonderful wonderful</u>
<u n="533" who="S0119">and <trunc>do</trunc> I hope that goes into a transcription somewhere <pause dur="short"/> this is not This is not how you use your metaphors children <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="534" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="535" who="S0119">you become like this insane man</u>
<u n="536" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="537" who="S0119">well the the thing is <trunc>y</trunc> you you'll you a lot of people are kind of used to YouTube looking like garbage <pause dur="short"/> but if the sound quality and video quality is okay they'll watch it <pause dur="short"/> like I have seen people watch entire runs of series at three sixty P resolution which looks awful but they will watch it cos it's available and free</u>
<u n="538" who="S0069"><unclear/></u>
<u n="539" who="S0119">and it's right in and it's right in front of them</u>
<u n="540" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="541" who="S0119">like it is literally in front of their face and they're like well I could've gone down to HMV and nah <pause dur="short"/> and you know they've already <trunc>wa</trunc> and they're watching it right there</u>
<u n="542" who="S0173">mm</u>
<u n="543" who="S0119">so like it's one of those things <pause dur="short"/> we're so but I I don't really buy the argument of like oh this is why I'm in the poor house it's like no</u>
<u n="544" who="S0173">because surely it just popularising his stuff like</u>
<u n="545" who="S0119">well that's one argument you can take <pause dur="short"/> that's one of the thing that</u>
<u n="546" who="S0173">so more people will go to see it live</u>
<u n="547" who="S0054">and I and and also they they I don't know I don't really see that argument that he has because is I don't think the standa-up comedians get much revenue from their DVD sales</u>
<u n="548" who="S0119">I think he's <unclear/> Em</u>
<u n="549" who="S0054" trans="overlap">like not compared to ticket sales</u>
<u n="550" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="551" who="S0069">yeah</u>
<u n="552" who="S0119">I think it's I think it's a nice bump though like it's a nice thing in the off season when you're relaxed</u>
<u n="553" who="S0054">mm <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's not it's not quite as bad as music industry whereas if you <trunc>w</trunc> where like if you buy an album for ten pounds maybe two P is going to the band</u>
<u n="554" who="S0119">yeah <pause dur="short"/> whereas you go to the</u>
<u n="555" who="S0054" trans="overlap">em it it it isn't quite that bad I imagine they do probably get like I don't know a quid for every DVD or something <pause dur="short"/> so but it's it would be a reasonable em proportion but compared to ticket sales that's that's why comedians tour <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="556" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0069">mm</u>
<u n="558" who="S0054">that's where all of the money is generated</u>
<u n="559" who="S0119">yeah</u>
<u n="560" who="S0173">exactly <pause dur="short"/> they must spend much of it like on the road like</u>
<u n="561" who="S0119">yeah</u>
<u n="562" who="S0173">it must be quite difficult to like actually have a life</u>
<u n="563" who="S0054">I I like I like what Ed Byrne said about this in an interview actually <pause dur="short"/> em he was asked like so so you're doing like this you know hundred and fifty day tour or whatever em is is that like really exhausting? And he goes well kind of yeah but I don't really like it's it's it's a very small price to pay to do an awesome job like there are people doing far harder jobs being far more exhausted I don't want to be sitting here talking about oh it's so terrible working for two hours a night <pause dur="short"/> </u>
<u n="564" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's true</u>
<u n="565" who="S0069">yeah</u>
<u n="566" who="S0119">yeah</u>
<u n="567" who="S0054" trans="overlap">you know it's <pause dur="short"/> it it's it is a good point like sure it's exhausting but only as much as it's exhausting to travel you know</u>
<u n="568" who="S0173">I've often wondered what people like stand-up comedians and like evening performers do in their daytime? Like I guess they have to rehearse especially stand-up comedians because like they usually have a routine right? But they probably don't vary all that much on tour?</u>
<u n="569" who="S0054">and there isn't much like sound checking you have to do and stuff</u>
<u n="570" who="S0173">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they don't have to like train or practice</u>
<u n="571" who="S0054">mm</u>
<u n="572" who="S0173">their lines well you know</u>
<u n="573" who="S0119">get ripped</u>
<u n="574" who="S0054">I think <trunc>mo</trunc> most of the time it's it's essentially a em <pause dur="short"/> the yeah they're all late starters and</u>

<u n="578" who="S0054"><trunc>A</trunc> and that adrenaline kick is going to keep you awake till about two or three</u>

<u n="580" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="581" who="S0054">yeah <pause dur="short"/> em so <trunc>y</trunc> you spend the day I think you know I get the impression on tour that the time which you don't spend literally travelling in the car or on the train or whatever em you spend walking around the place that you're you've just arrived in</u>
<u n="582" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="583" who="S0054">to get a feel for the place</u>
<u n="584" who="S0069">yeah getting the local newspaper and stuff</u>
<u n="585" who="S0054">well yeah I mean that kind of stuff if if you have the time for press <pause dur="short"/> em em</u>
<u n="586" who="S0173">so you can relate to your audience</u>
<u n="587" who="S0054">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean a lot of comedians actively seek their first sort of four or five lines that for that evening show that afternoon <pause dur="short"/> em like they walk around and they talk about but <trunc>t</trunc> the danger there is because you're unfamiliar with somewhere and you're looking for material you'll probably end up just making an easy joke everyone's already heard <pause dur="short"/> like we all know that I don't know Boots is upside down <pause dur="short"/> I I don't know <pause dur="short"/> it would <trunc>w</trunc> what it would be you know like everyone would already know that thing which is obvious enough for that person to be making a joke</u>
<u n="588" who="S0173">but then maybe that's fine cos maybe that helps them to like maybe even though they know it's obvious it's just okay cos it helps them establish a relationship</u>
<u n="589" who="S0054">well it it depends on on the audience I mean it <trunc>d</trunc> it <pause dur="short"/> some some people like you know predictable jokes <pause dur="short"/> they almost prefer it if they could see it coming <pause dur="short"/> that's why things like Little Britain are popular when they're gob shite</u>
<u n="590" who="S0069">mm</u>
<u n="591" who="S0054">and they em whereas em yeah I mean <trunc>so</trunc> some people just really don't like hearing an obvious joke</u>
<u n="592" who="S0069">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it is just <pause dur="short"/> I don't know I think I vary between the two like if the obvious joke is really funny then that's fine even though it's obvious but</u>
<u n="593" who="S0054">I think I think it's at how it's delivered</u>
<u n="594" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="595" who="S0054">em like there's that Mitchell and Webb sketch the eh rocket scientist and the brain surgeon?</u>
<u n="596" who="S0173">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="597" who="S0054">and you can see the joke coming a million miles away but it's just delivered in such a way where they know you can see it coming</u>
<u n="598" who="S0173">yeah</u>
<u n="599" who="S0054">and then they just</u>
<u n="600" who="S0069">it's just so well set up</u>
<u n="601" who="S0054">it's just delivered perfectly basically it <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="602" who="S0119">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think it also depends on like em how conscious you are aware of it or how much you're I mean you might know it already but you might not actually give a crap about it and having it actually highlighted is like oh that's oh wow okay</u>
<u n="603" who="S0054">mm</u>
