<u n="408" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="409" who="S0444">so we'll just we'll just see I hope she's okay but it's probably just one of those things that'll blow over maybe it's not maybe it will be but I've <trunc>be</trunc> I've been through the waves enough times</u>

<u n="423" who="S0444" trans="overlap">oh that's the yeah like yeah but I think we've kind of I think that's just the kind of thing where like I was still struggling with like you know what is an expectation of a relationship? what is a relationship? what what isn't a relationship? you know</u>

<u n="425" who="S0444">but erm</u>

<u n="427" who="S0444" trans="overlap">yeah exactly and to be honest we haven't really we haven't really figured it out or more to the point we didn't you know we understood that it would be different but we didn't understand how it would be different and it's the kind of thing that you know with communication it's like well I'm going to fly off the handle or like you know</u>
<u n="428" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="429" who="S0444">or you know and I think it's that kind of thing just been like actually <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> all so the expectations that you have get rid of them because they're not in the situation it doesn't mean that you shouldn't aim for things or you know want things but all the expectations or baggage that you have from somebody else get rid of them</u>
<u n="430" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="431" who="S0444">you know? cos it's the kind of thing that like oh this is was different a lot of the time it wasn't like I was being clingy but I was constantly aware that at some point <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> might turn around and not want to be with me especially when I got really quite erm</u>

<u n="640" who="S0444">what would you do?</u>
<u n="641" who="S0439">what would you do you know? you don't want to get back into that rut that you were before when you were going out and then you broke up and you kind of like she became really sociable again cos she didn't have a boyfriend and then the moment they got together she suddenly was like no no no I'm back with him I don't need my friends and I was like</u>

<u n="862" who="S0439">I was thinking that do they get like the clothes donated to them or do they have to pay there to exhibit them?</u>
<u n="863" who="S0444">erm could be a bit of both</u>
<u n="864" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="865" who="S0444">for particular pieces it could be a but usually stuff is like on loan</u>
<u n="866" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="867" who="S0444">that either they get their name published in the <unclear/> or you know there will be some dealing and bartering going on but you know it's the kind of thing that</u>

<u n="872" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="873" who="S0444">monochrome is a bit kind of basic but then as it goes on it gets more and more sophisticated and you'll go from one minute being in a room full of skulls</u>
<u n="874" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="875" who="S0444">to the next minute being in a really really bright red driven traditional more normal looking clothes</u>
<u n="876" who="S0439" trans="overlap">mm exactly</u>
<u n="877" who="S0444">and then you'll go through to the big finale which is obviously the cabinet of curiosities</u>
<u n="878" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="879" who="S0444">and like I was a bit like there's there were too many people in there</u>
<u n="880" who="S0439">there was they let in too many people</u>
<u n="881" who="S0444" trans="overlap">to enjoy it</u>
<u n="882" who="S0439">I can understand why the wanted to get so many people through because so many people wanted to see the exhibition but</u>
<u n="883" who="S0444" trans="overlap">it was full I'm not being funny but I am being funny it's the kind of things where it's like people with prams don't do it</u>
<u n="884" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah no people with people with prams there are so many places they should not go</u>
<u n="885" who="S0444">I mean like I you know</u>
<u n="886" who="S0439">you can't discriminate but</u>
<u n="887" who="S0444" trans="overlap">definitely you should go but that with that many people</u>
<u n="888" who="S0439">but why would your kid even yeah? why would you take it? it's just</u>
<u n="889" who="S0444">well I suppose you have to but</u>
<u n="890" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="891" who="S0444">it's the kind of thing where it's like let them in at a time when there's not so many people walking round cos it's not just that you're kind of having to move a pram it's more like what if somebody trips or elbows or you know? it's just not safe</u>
<u n="892" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="893" who="S0444">but like</u>
<u n="894" who="S0439">they did let too many people in but it was a stunning exhibition wasn't it?</u>
<u n="895" who="S0444" trans="overlap">although my my auntie's niece on the other side of the family erm is doing her PhD in fashion like kind of history more textile kind of thing</u>
<u n="896" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="897" who="S0444">erm but she did a lot of work with the V and A and we were and she doesn't really talk that much but she definitely started talking about the exhibit and we actually had quite a bit of a conversation about it and it was great but you know erm</u>
<u n="898" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah it's it's just a really</u>
<u n="899" who="S0444" trans="overlap">it's a really really good one I hope</u>
<u n="900" who="S0439" trans="overlap">stunning one</u>
<u n="901" who="S0444">but I honestly don't think it would have been as good if it hadn't have been in the Met cos it was the Met over in America</u>
<u n="902" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="903" who="S0444">that had staged it all and then we just nicked the staging so it was the kind of thing that if we hadn't have done if they hadn't have done it first we would never have come up with something so elaborate and so dramatic in a way</u>
<u n="904" who="S0439" trans="overlap">no no it was that box of that box of curiosities at the end wasn't it? that was intense that was you just walked in and it felt like a creepy children's film but beautiful at the same time</u>
<u n="905" who="S0444" trans="overlap">and also yeah and also the bit that was just after the Kate Moss thing where</u>
<u n="906" who="S0439">yeah that was stunning</u>
<u n="907" who="S0444" trans="overlap">that was so cool</u>
<u n="908" who="S0439">that was so clever</u>
<u n="909" who="S0444">and then like you know I'm all about like I'm not really about the skulls or the random heads of things or</u>
<u n="910" who="S0439" trans="overlap">no and like that wildlife one you know like the African one I was a bit like no I would wear any of those</u>
<u n="911" who="S0444" trans="overlap">that was a bit like I'm a bit freaked out right now I mean</u>
<u n="912" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah I don't think I would wear any of those clothes really but</u>
<u n="913" who="S0444" trans="overlap">no you wouldn't wear anything it was the most weird kind of dinosaur shoes that's like dinosaur egg shoes that's the only way I can describe them</u>
<u n="914" who="S0439">you can understand why Lady Gaga liked him so much</u>
<u n="915" who="S0444">oh yeah</u>
<u n="916" who="S0439">can't you? definitely right up her alley</u>
<u n="917" who="S0444">yeah but it I honestly think that you know I think this is this is what it said anyway in one of the kind of texts was that you know those and it was like I was saying to you before it was like those people were on such a different creative plane</u>
<u n="918" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="919" who="S0444">that no wonder they feel so isolated or so different or just on a different level it doesn't mean it's any better but it's a very different way of thinking and approaching things which is great</u>
<u n="920" who="S0439" trans="overlap">no mm</u>
<u n="921" who="S0444">but it also means that you know with great power they are</u>

<u n="1099" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0444">because the stuff that we you would usually get done in a day it took two or three meetings for other people to get their heads round like what is that?</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0439">also not just stopping you well stopping you but that couple who sat next to us were the weirdest couple what was?</u>

<u n="1109" who="S0439"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> tattoo <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0444" trans="overlap">tattoo <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>

<u n="1112" who="S0444">digital services manager whatever that is</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0439">did that cause a bit of tension between him and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> at all?</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0444">I don't know because nobody really wanted that job</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0439">oh</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0444">and they all got told that they should apply for it and everyone was like meh erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is pregnant</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0439">oh the ginger-haired woman who got married a few years ago?</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0444">yeah and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he's alright I think he just wants more money which is fair enough</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0439" trans="overlap">everybody wants more money yeah</u>
<u n="1120" who="S0444" trans="overlap">no but it's fair enough after like five seven? seven? is it seven years?</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah wow he's been on the same salary for seven years?</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0444">not the same subject but the same</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0439" trans="overlap">no the same salary kind of thing</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0444">well it would keep going up I'm assuming but not very much</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0439" trans="overlap">yeah but not very much</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0444">and what was interesting was that this restructure it was like no I don't believe in giving people pay rises within their roles like not as in like substantial ones I I believe they should just be paid for their role</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0439">who said that?</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0444">the über marketing director</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0439">bollocks</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0444">in which case I one of my questions to them is are you going to make it transparent what the salary bands are? because I know that I deserve to be paid a damn lot more than I have been because I would argue okay yeah maybe I'm not doing the extra projects that other senior execs are doing</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0439">you're busy as hell</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0444" trans="overlap">but I am busy as hell and I'm doing a lot more than some of them have been doing</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0444">I mean everybody is über busy and flat out right now which is you know there's no comparison but it's not like I think I should be promoted I just think I deserve a little bit more <trunc>mo</trunc>money to make it feasible erm you know or at least an inducement to stay so I think if it was the kind of thing that I was like right I've got this job offer what do you want to do?</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0439">I think you should leave anyway</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0444">oh yeah I know</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0439" trans="overlap">I don't you're not happy and it like you obviously now you're getting a bit better and you were worked too hard but if you were crying in a car because you didn't want to go back to work you should not be spending your twenties crying in a car hating your job</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0444" trans="overlap">yeah exactly doing that no of course not but it's also that kind of thing that it's more that I've got to I feel that I've got to prove that I'm well enough to do the work that I've got</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0439">yeah of course you do yeah</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0444">and feel comfortable within it myself but also from that lesson be like no I'm not doing that</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0439">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="1142" who="S0444">and it's one of the things that I'm like right okay you've got this restructure but what are you wanting me to do? because I will tell you flat out if it's not if it's too much</u>
<u n="1143" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0444">you know I'm just like I will tell you flat out if it's too much and you've already got the warning of why that's not a good thing so you can't do that again anymore you can't just pile it on and expect me to be okay with it</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0444">if you do you know and marketing were blaming <anon type="place"/> which wasn't fair at all they were like oh they put too much on you and I'm like it's not them it's actually you</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0439">yeah you've done this to me</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0444">you're the idiots who've done it</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="1150" who="S0444">but you know like I feel less I feel so much less bothered</u>
<u n="1151" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="1152" who="S0444">about it not in a bad way not as in like I don't want to do well or I don't want to do my job I still you know enjoy my job I'm good at it but I just don't care as much anymore I'm not as invested or like feel that it's all on me</u>
<u n="1153" who="S0439">yeah it's not all on you yeah</u>
<u n="1154" who="S0444">well that's what I mean it's that kind of thing I'm just like actually now it's like <trunc>me</trunc> you know the reason why I don't really want to look at the job that the recruiter's given me it's because it's for a technology company that deals with different porous materials that's not really me</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0439">no</u>
<u n="1156" who="S0444">but it's waiting for that right opportunity to come along the er the <trunc>mar</trunc> the marketing execs library job looks good but I'm I wouldn't feel right applying for a job when I'm on sick leave or when I'm just coming back from sick leave</u>
<u n="1157" who="S0439" trans="overlap">no not at all</u>
<u n="1158" who="S0444">that would be okay some people would be like yeah that's a wise move but <trunc>other</trunc> but I would feel dishonest being like yeah I can</u>
<u n="1159" who="S0439">yeah of course</u>
<u n="1160" who="S0444">I can go for a full-time role but I've just been off work</u>
<u n="1161" who="S0439">but I've just been ill yeah</u>
<u n="1162" who="S0444">yeah it's it's just not</u>
<u n="1163" who="S0439">no</u>
<u n="1164" who="S0444">it's not a good thing it's much better for me to be like yeah okay there was one period of illness that I had while I've been working over the last three years er I got the help that I needed I put the tactics and the management skills in place</u>
<u n="1165" who="S0439">you've learnt from it and you're sorted</u>
<u n="1166" who="S0444">exactly do you know what I mean? that's a much more positive story to give rather than I'm still on <unclear/></u>
<u n="1167" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="1168" who="S0444">you know if I were going for any job like supermarket retail office you know temp job</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0439">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="1170" who="S0444">it'd be alright but no I want a job that you know I'm interested but I know that I also need to scale what the job's going to be and if I don't get myself</u>
