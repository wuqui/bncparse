<u n="11" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0470">maybe make it the first something or other of the month or something like that</u>
<u n="13" who="S0432">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos we're doing loads of events this month so next week we've got a workshop I don't know if you've seen the other posters around with someone going ah <vocal desc="gasp"/>?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0470">I haven't no</u>
<u n="16" who="S0428">so we're doing more on like what what the corpus is and how we use it and how we and how it's like fed into the products so it might be quite nice to do one after we've finished all these workshops</u>
<u n="17" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0470">yes so then people can see what comes out at the other end</u>
<u n="19" who="S0432" trans="overlap">just because people will be a bit more aware <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0470">mm so how how many volunteers do you have altogether doing recordings? is it thousands?</u>
<u n="22" who="S0428" trans="overlap">erm <pause dur="short"/> we've with this project we do have thousands cos there's so many but this particular project we are running at the moment I think we've got five hundred and twenty unique speakers</u>
<u n="23" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="24" who="S0428">and we've just hit eight million words transcribed this morning so</u>
<u n="25" who="S0470">wow</u>
<u n="26" who="S0432">we're nearly there we only want well we want about eleven and a half</u>
<u n="27" who="S0428">it's yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0432">so</u>
<u n="29" who="S0470">right</u>
<u n="30" who="S0432">we're nearly there</u>
<u n="31" who="S0428" trans="overlap">so it is exciting <pause dur="short"/> yeah we are getting there</u>
<u n="32" who="S0432" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> we're getting yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0428">it's really like satisfying seeing it going up and</u>
<u n="34" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0470" trans="overlap">yes I saw you had been doing some tweeting on social media</u>
<u n="37" who="S0428">oh yeah cos we were at the Festival of Ideas erm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0470" trans="overlap">were you? oh well that should generate some more people shouldn't it</u>
<u n="39" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah hopefully yeah we've got quite</u>
<u n="40" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah we've already got some recordings</u>
<u n="41" who="S0432" trans="overlap">I think we've got about seventy emails</u>
<u n="42" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0470">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0432">yeah people signing up so hopefully even if ten of those actually contribute then <pause dur="short"/> that's still really good</u>
<u n="45" who="S0428" trans="overlap">that's amazing</u>
<u n="46" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0470" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="48" who="S0428">because it's only <pause dur="short"/> you only have to hook one person and then they they kind of get ten people involved so it's it is just making like make putting it out there so</u>
<u n="49" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0470">how how do people find it works works best by organising a bit of an event like come along and and talks or just having lunch with a friend or something like that?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0428">most of them are just having lunch with a friend or like a family putting it on while they're they</u>
<u n="52" who="S0432">having dinner or something</u>
<u n="53" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0470">yes</u>
<u n="55" who="S0428">I mean we don't ever listen to the recordings so it's <pause dur="short"/> they they kind of come in and we just check that the sound they are not having a disco going on in the background but erm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0470" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0428">yeah so we don't really know what what the content is often</u>
<u n="58" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0428">but it is incredible we get like we are starting to process like the <trunc>fir</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> like the first words and soon we'll have the first five million all kind of processed and cleaned up and it is just really exciting to <pause dur="short"/> to be be able to see what's gonna come out of it and</u>
<u n="60" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0428">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="62" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0470">I'm interested in the different types of language that we use for different occasions</u>
<u n="64" who="S0428">mm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0470">so you were talking about saying what are the most common words being used at Cambridge University Press and that's interesting</u>
<u n="67" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0470">so I imagine it is different from what you would get if you went to a school playground or even if you went to a pub</u>
<u n="70" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah definitely</u>
<u n="71" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah in fact we are going to when we've got those all the conversations in from last time they they are not quite fully transcribed yet we will put together all the recordings made at lunch time here</u>
<u n="72" who="S0470">right</u>
<u n="73" who="S0428">and find out kind of do we have a wider vocabulary than average or not? is it smaller? or</u>
<u n="74" who="S0432">yeah just do a little bit of analysis on it</u>
<u n="75" who="S0470" trans="overlap">oh dear right <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="76" who="S0432">oh no don't worry <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0470">it might not be what we want to know might it?</u>
<u n="78" who="S0428">just chuck in some long words <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="79" who="S0470">it would be serendipity if we did turn out some</u>
<u n="80" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="81" who="S0428">what do you do here?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0470">what do I do? I do marketing in the bibles department and it's good to come and talk to you today because there's only four of us and the other three have all just all left to go to a trip</u>
<u n="83" who="S0428">ah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0432" trans="overlap">ah so you're on your own today?</u>

<u n="88" who="S0470">yes yes</u>
<u n="89" who="S0428">it's tiny</u>
<u n="90" who="S0470">yeah and the others are all men</u>

<u n="97" who="S0470">how do we do it?</u>
<u n="98" who="S0428">how what do you? where do you have to go and?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0470">well principally through the trade through</u>
<u n="100" who="S0428" trans="overlap"></u>
<u n="101" who="S0470">yeah there's a <pause dur="short"/> christian bookshops are the the second largest type of <trunc>book</trunc>bookshop specialists with children's books being the largest</u>
<u n="102" who="S0428" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="103" who="S0432">mm</u>
<u n="104" who="S0470">but if you think about it there aren't many shops that specialise in fishing books or sports books or politics books</u>
<u n="105" who="S0428" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="106" who="S0432" trans="overlap">no that's true</u>
<u n="107" who="S0470">on their own or even cookery books although that's probably the one of the biggest areas</u>
<u n="108" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0428">quite a good idea for a shop isn't it a cookery book shop? <vocal desc="laugh"/> <trunc>co</trunc></u>
<u n="110" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0470">well yeah you could have the authors along to do their tastings</u>

<u n="116" who="S0432" trans="overlap">no <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0428">I don't think it would go down well here but er</u>
<u n="118" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah oh that's</u>
<u n="119" who="S0470">yeah so there's lots of Christian bookshops for example the <pause dur="short"/> the <trunc>Christ</trunc> they keep being taken over by different groups but erm there's the CLC bookshop on <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="120" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah we cycle past that</u>
<u n="121" who="S0470">yeah</u>

<u n="124" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0470">to be an SPCK which got taken over by another organisation and didn't flourish</u>

<u n="127" who="S0470">shall we say and there's there is a little one in <anon type="place"/>'s church but it is more of a book stall than shop</u>

<u n="130" who="S0428">yeah</u>

<u n="133" who="S0432">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0428">and what other books is it just pure bibles or are there other books that are published connected to it or?</u>
<u n="135" who="S0470" trans="overlap">er its well there's two sorts of books there's bibles and prayer books</u>
<u n="136" who="S0428" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0470">but there there's no there's no new authors</u>
<u n="138" who="S0428" trans="overlap">so it's just</u>
<u n="139" who="S0470">if there was a book about bibles you know like a commentary then that would be done by the religious studies</u>
<u n="140" who="S0428">oh okay</u>
<u n="141" who="S0432" trans="overlap">oh yeah of course yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0470">so we specialise in the fine binding <pause dur="short"/> binding in the traditional way with fine leathers and India paper</u>

<u n="144" who="S0432" trans="overlap">oh wow</u>
<u n="145" who="S0428">that must be such a lovely job to put those together and work with all those lovely materials</u>

<u n="147" who="S0432" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0470">yeah it's</u>
<u n="149" who="S0428" trans="overlap">and do you get them <pause dur="short"/> where are they bound? are they bound in <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0470" trans="overlap">well some of them are bound in the Netherlands which is why my colleagues have gone to see the people who do the binding</u>
<u n="151" who="S0428">ah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0432" trans="overlap">ah so they're going over</u>
<u n="153" who="S0470">we used to have our we used to do printing and binding here</u>
<u n="154" who="S0432">mm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0428">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="156" who="S0470">but of course we haven't got a binder any more and we don't we don't really have the printers any more</u>
<u n="157" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="158" who="S0428">yeah I'm not sure that you would cope with India</u>
<u n="159" who="S0470" trans="overlap">am I allowed to say negatives?</u>
<u n="160" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="161" who="S0428">yeah that's fine</u>
<u n="162" who="S0470">although I am being recorded here</u>
<u n="163" who="S0428"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="164" who="S0470">yeah so so we use a range of specialist printers and binders</u>
<u n="165" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0470">according to whatever translation it is and what the edition calls for</u>
<u n="167" who="S0432" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="168" who="S0428">ah so they so they get they're all translated here as <trunc>we</trunc>? well they are all they are all translated and you can just</u>
<u n="169" who="S0470" trans="overlap">erm well the king James bible was translated here part of it but not in my time</u>
<u n="170" who="S0428" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="171" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="172" who="S0470">obviously <pause dur="short"/> yeah no they they're project managed here by <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="173" who="S0428">mm hm</u>
<u n="174" who="S0470">he's the production <trunc>bible</trunc> well bibles but business manager but he looks after the specification and production</u>
<u n="175" who="S0432">ah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0470">so they get them made by people who can do that sort of work there's not very many people who do prints on India paper these days</u>
<u n="177" who="S0432">no</u>
<u n="178" who="S0428">no I can imagine</u>
<u n="179" who="S0470">and some of the work's done by hand it's it is very different from any other books the press does</u>
<u n="180" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0432">yeah I presume is it a lot more expensive to get all that done? <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="182" who="S0470">yes especially when they're bound in goat skin leather</u>
<u n="183" who="S0432">oh wow</u>
<u n="184" who="S0470">and if you print onto India paper it has to be done very slowly</u>
<u n="185" who="S0432">mm</u>
<u n="186" who="S0470">because the paper's thin</u>
<u n="187" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0470">and sometimes you're printing red and black at the same time <pause dur="short"/> so that</u>
<u n="189" who="S0428" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="190" who="S0432">wow</u>
<u n="191" who="S0470">has a cost implication</u>
<u n="192" who="S0428" trans="overlap">and how often</u>
<u n="193" who="S0432" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="194" who="S0428">like how many are printed a year roughly? or is that not something <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="195" who="S0470">oh that's classified information <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="196" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="197" who="S0428"><vocal desc="laugh"/> no we don't want to know</u>

<u n="203" who="S0432">yeah</u>
<u n="204" who="S0470">but the king James has been on the list since the seventeenth century so we've got most of that</u>
<u n="205" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's incredible isn't it to think it hasn't it hasn't been out of print in all that time</u>
<u n="206" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="207" who="S0470">no well <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="208" who="S0428" trans="overlap">that's amazing</u>

<u n="211" who="S0432" trans="overlap">almost from the beginning <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="212" who="S0470">yeah</u>
<u n="213" who="S0428">that's incredible isn't it</u>
