<u n="51" who="S0519">yes</u>
<u n="52" who="S0520">and then you know it doesn't matter if you have to go to the hairdresser a couple of times a year</u>
<u n="53" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah I think once this has been cut now there'll be a lot less of the yellow might go a tiny bit shorter</u>
<u n="54" who="S0520">yeah</u>

<u n="96" who="S0520">yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>

<u n="106" who="S0520">I know</u>
<u n="107" who="S0519">erm and he supposed to have got the proofs through and they go back and forward and back and forward and he's still finishing off some other chorus's CD</u>
<u n="108" who="S0520">no ways</u>
<u n="109" who="S0519">and we've not even heard the proofs yet so and he keeps saying no it'll be fine don't worry well they're they're really worried</u>
<u n="110" who="S0520">don't worry</u>
<u n="111" who="S0519">the music team wanted to you know? really have time to do some editing</u>
<u n="112" who="S0520">that's annoying</u>
<u n="113" who="S0519">yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0520">so you've not heard it?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0519">so we've not heard any of it yet no <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="116" who="S0520">I'm going to</u>
<u n="117" who="S0519">and we had erm we had <pause dur="short"/> erm our own one of our own girls who's gone to university just his year to study art</u>
<u n="118" who="S0520">oh yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0519">design the cover he was going to <trunc>si</trunc>design it for us but erm she's designed it</u>
<u n="120" who="S0520">oh right</u>
<u n="121" who="S0519">and we've seen the proofs of that it's beautiful</u>
<u n="122" who="S0520">mm</u>
<u n="123" who="S0519">erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="124" who="S0520">so are you going to sell it on Itunes as well?</u>
<u n="125" who="S0519">I doubt it no I think it'll just be a word of mouth selling erm I'm going to turn my side of the heating apparatus down so feel free</u>
<u n="126" who="S0520" trans="overlap">yeah it's quite warm isn't it? the sun's actually shining so</u>
<u n="127" who="S0519">yeah so if you turn this down it's the coolness of the air on your face</u>
<u n="128" who="S0520">right</u>
<u n="129" who="S0519">so and then it comes out of here and so you can have cooler air on your face which is sometimes nice</u>
<u n="130" who="S0520">is dad going to let you upgrade the car? never?</u>
<u n="131" who="S0519">erm well I plan that</u>
<u n="132" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="133" who="S0519">erm when he <trunc>re</trunc> when he gets his retirement fund so I I have vaguely hinted at it</u>
<u n="134" who="S0520" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="135" who="S0519">I've made a plan and dad has made a plan in his head</u>
<u n="136" who="S0520">good for you</u>
<u n="137" who="S0519">no we've <trunc>ha</trunc>had this whole big thing that we have to solve yet</u>
<u n="138" who="S0520">which is?</u>
<u n="139" who="S0519">which is erm that erm I we dad and I always assumed we would just take his whole pension package as a monthly salary and when he went to the retirement sort of course that erm was provided erm they talked about options of taking lump sums of different sizes and you can take a huge lump sum the maximum is about half a million pounds so we're talking huge lump sum</u>
<u n="140" who="S0520">as a percentage of your pension?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0519">as a percentage of your pension and then you get a lot smaller pension monthly and you invest the lump sum or do things with the lump sum whatever you want to do you know so you could use it for certain things to start you out and then invest the rest and erm they were saying if you if you just invested it and you got is per cent per annum of it will be investment then it would entirely replace the money that you had missed</u>
<u n="142" who="S0519">monthly yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0520">monthly but the plus side is that of course you also have half a million pounds to leave to your children instead of your pension is gone when you've gone do you see the difference?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0520">oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0519">so you've actually got half a million pounds you're not losing out on your on your pension or monthly salary but you've got this lump sum as well</u>
<u n="146" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0519">which perhaps later in your life you could start using</u>
<u n="148" who="S0520">to what degree is it going to reduce your monthly income?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0519" trans="overlap">er well it does reduce it quite a lot so what we need to do erm dad went and talked to the bank of course erm and what he really talked about was what sort of investments he could do so that we wouldn't touch the lump sum at present and we would replace any of the money that we lost erm with you know a a moderate risk investment erm and I I'm just really nervous about the whole thing like you know I I want us to feel really comfortable monthly and not have to worry about that</u>
<u n="150" who="S0520">definitely</u>
<u n="151" who="S0519">erm cos dad's personality is such that if you had a lot less that he could you know cope with that</u>
<u n="152" who="S0520">no he couldn't</u>
<u n="153" who="S0519">and also that dad you know his whole tying everything all up scenario means you then are</u>
<u n="154" who="S0520" trans="overlap">I was just about to say that</u>
<u n="155" who="S0519">living on less and you can't get at the benefits</u>
<u n="156" who="S0520" trans="overlap">I was about to say if you took the lump sum dad's tendency would be to lock it up somewhere</u>
<u n="157" who="S0519">absolutely and we wouldn't be</u>
<u n="158" who="S0520" trans="overlap">and you'd be on rations and eating beans on toast</u>
<u n="159" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yes this is the whole thing that worries me <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="160" who="S0520">you have to figure out what your monthly</u>
<u n="161" who="S0519" trans="overlap">so we need to decide that by next May so we've got time</u>
<u n="162" who="S0520">you have to you have to maybe er figure out what your monthly</u>
<u n="163" who="S0519">yes</u>
<u n="164" who="S0520">expenditures are you know I know it's hard to tell</u>
<u n="165" who="S0519">no that's right</u>
<u n="166" who="S0520">because things change but roughly you know because I imagine it's quite a lot</u>
<u n="167" who="S0519">it it's funny because we we've since we've been living here and dad was so worried about the money and that's what I want to wipe away I don't want that</u>
<u n="168" who="S0520" trans="overlap">absolutely yeah</u>
<u n="169" who="S0519">erm it's in his nature to be worried</u>
<u n="170" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="171" who="S0519">about it and but it it made life hard because we weren't we weren't relaxing and enjoying we you know we haven't been on a big holiday we didn't do all these things and I want to do all the adventures you know while we're young erm <pause dur="short"/> so it it but we found that we can live quite moderately but I don't live at all now in the same way that I did where I don't think about money if I want something or I want to give something I <trunc>d</trunc>didn't even think when dad was earning in the last years I just did whatever I wanted I never thought about it</u>
<u n="172" who="S0520" trans="overlap">of course well that's the goal isn't it?</u>
<u n="173" who="S0519" trans="overlap">and that was the luxury that we what we'd earned over all those years of of working for it</u>
<u n="174" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="175" who="S0519">but this year I don't I don't I don't feel that at all I feel</u>
<u n="176" who="S0520" trans="overlap">no it's depressing</u>
<u n="177" who="S0519">I have to think about everything if I want to give anybody money I have to think about it you know I have I have to you know I haven't got much myself so I haven't got that liberated feeling er so it it needs a lot of thinking and</u>
<u n="178" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="179" who="S0519">a lot of <trunc>a</trunc><trunc>a</trunc>assurances you know that erm that we would be so comfortable that we that we could regain an element of that luxury feeling</u>
<u n="180" who="S0520">yeah well that's</u>
<u n="181" who="S0519">we don't have to spend all the time cos I think I probably got into quite bad habits erm you know and now I I realise I you know we could still sort of be luxurious without being wasteful</u>
<u n="182" who="S0520">yeah fair enough I do wonder though like <unclear/> of it if dad's getting three two-thirds of his final salary as a pension that's right isn't it?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0519">yes</u>
<u n="184" who="S0520">two-thirds</u>
<u n="185" who="S0519"><trunc>mo</trunc>more even</u>
<u n="186" who="S0520" trans="overlap">and you're not earning but you don't have a mortgage</u>
<u n="187" who="S0519">no that's right</u>
<u n="188" who="S0520">and what else don't you have?</u>
<u n="189" who="S0519">erm so what er we we just don't have the mortgage that's the big things</u>
<u n="190" who="S0520" trans="overlap">yeah that's the big thing so <unclear/></u>
<u n="191" who="S0519">erm which at the at the</u>
<u n="192" who="S0520" trans="overlap">which dad was paying off at the rate of</u>
<u n="193" who="S0519" trans="overlap"><trunc>a</trunc>and yeah hugely</u>
<u n="194" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="195" who="S0519">so it was about two and a half thousand a month dad was paying off so he could get rid of it</u>
<u n="196" who="S0520" trans="overlap">so two and a half times twelve is like let's say thirty grand a year</u>
<u n="197" who="S0519">and and then that's after tax you know so erm I think what dad worked out</u>
<u n="198" who="S0520" trans="overlap">I'm just saying whether you would you know you're roughly in terms of spendable money</u>
<u n="199" who="S0519">yes what he did was <trunc>wor</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="200" who="S0520" trans="overlap">what's the word? expendable income whether you are going to have more or less the same as you did when he was working</u>
<u n="201" who="S0519">I think that's what he worked out and what he forgot was that my salary was <trunc>a</trunc> in the last years quite small about sixteen thousand</u>
<u n="202" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="203" who="S0519">erm and there was something else erm he forgot to think about erm <pause dur="short"/> but that that's not nothing and erm</u>
<u n="204" who="S0520" trans="overlap">not at all and that's you was yours</u>
<u n="205" who="S0519">and that was mine and erm</u>
<u n="206" who="S0520" trans="overlap"><unclear/> jolly</u>
<u n="207" who="S0519">and so I think he forgot that we would be losing that so we will be a little less well off but then eventually we will get our pensions at sixty-seven I'll get my pension which will replace a bit of that erm <pause dur="short"/> I don't know we won't be much worse off anyway</u>
<u n="208" who="S0520" trans="overlap">like you say like it's no well it's important to to for dad to get his head around that cos he's got this weird mentality of like I'm on my pension but it just doesn't really apply does it? if that's the if that's your pension he's not getting a state pension you know so he he has he has to kind of acknowledge like that you're just as well off in terms of and then he has to have some some pots that are accessible for things which are like</u>
<u n="209" who="S0519">yeah</u>
<u n="210" who="S0520">extraneous expenses like for instance when you move you're going to have to buy a lot of stuff</u>
<u n="211" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah yes that's right</u>
<u n="212" who="S0520">furniture decorating the natural</u>
<u n="213" who="S0519">changing the house</u>

<u n="215" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="216" who="S0520">yeah and that's not going to be part of your monthly outgoings right?</u>
<u n="217" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="218" who="S0520">it's not like a monthly thing so there has to be somewhere from <trunc>wea</trunc> somewhere from where you're going to take that money for those types of things holidays and erm trips and what have you you know that that's <unclear/></u>
<u n="219" who="S0519" trans="overlap">no that's right</u>
<u n="220" who="S0520">he has to know you don't mind really <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="221" who="S0519">no</u>
<u n="222" who="S0520">it's just for dad it's just a case of like having it in his mind you know because he somehow feels as if he doesn't have money which is completely ludicrous and it's just because it's not accessible</u>
<u n="223" who="S0519" trans="overlap">no that's right</u>
<u n="224" who="S0520">so he needs to have accessible bits for the purpose of your spending and enjoyment allocated I guess that's what this big pot would be wouldn't it? if you took the money out first at the if you took the the pot from the pension and then</u>
<u n="225" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="226" who="S0520">kept the rest for monthly instalments</u>
<u n="227" who="S0519">yes erm</u>
<u n="228" who="S0520">yeah you want to keep some of it sort of like liquid</u>
<u n="229" who="S0519">mm that's right or something that's paying you a monthly dividend or paying you</u>
<u n="230" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="231" who="S0519">a an annual dividend that you divvy out I don't know but erm</u>
<u n="232" who="S0520">yeah so the bank advised him to take the pot did they?</u>
<u n="233" who="S0519">well no the</u>
<u n="234" who="S0520">oh</u>
<u n="235" who="S0520">pension fund said that the majority of people took the lump sum and these were the reasons but erm they they also talked about the reasons that are very hard for dad to get his head round which are that you actually do something with the er pot like that you use some of it right at the beginning for some things that you've maybe always wanted erm that you know anything</u>
<u n="236" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="237" who="S0519">erm that you had a plan of what what what would be nice to do with this money</u>
<u n="238" who="S0520" trans="overlap">to do with it yeah</u>
<u n="239" who="S0519">it's such a huge amount of money erm and so funnily enough that's what the bank manager reiterated he said you know to take this huge amount of money to invest is erm it's not really the only way you should be looking at it that you should be looking at the money as what can I do with it?</u>
<u n="240" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="241" who="S0519">er for me</u>
<u n="242" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="243" who="S0519">erm and invest it but you should maybe have a plan of what why would you take it? you may as well just have the luxury of knowing you've got this money</u>
<u n="244" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="245" who="S0519">I don't know it's <trunc>re</trunc> I can't get my head round it and I wasn't at any of the conversations that were had</u>
<u n="246" who="S0520">oh</u>
<u n="247" who="S0519">erm so I'd like to be</u>
<u n="248" who="S0520">yeah you should be</u>
<u n="249" who="S0519">mm I I my one criticism of dad it's a kind of a <pause dur="long"/> a I he's so clever that he doesn't even with financial things he doesn't tend to have got his head round erm the tax situation the differences you know and he'll sometimes just suddenly say he doesn't know if that's pre or after tax or whatever and you think well that actually</u>
<u n="250" who="S0520">makes all the difference</u>
<u n="251" who="S0519">negates</u>
<u n="252" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="253" who="S0519">the whole conversation we may as well just wait till we find out you know erm and you you can have things like capital gains tax which is huge tax like forty per cent on erm one one of the pots of money that he's put away we will be have to have capital gains if we release any of it I was like really? you did that? erm and then he said well we can have so much a year without <trunc>ta</trunc> capital gains and we can take that each but it was all very woolly you know like how it all worked you would need a taxman to help you or a you know an accountant to get his head round all of the things you should do</u>
<u n="254" who="S0520">he's very clever but he's not he lacks common sense</u>
<u n="255" who="S0519" trans="overlap">he's not practical no</u>
<u n="256" who="S0520">and that's very typical of very intellectual people</u>
<u n="257" who="S0519">yes that's right</u>
<u n="258" who="S0520">like they don't know how to tie their shoelaces you know it's like that kind of thing so it's I mean I do trust him to know what he's doing but on the other hand</u>
<u n="259" who="S0519" trans="overlap">I do he does tend to miss</u>
<u n="260" who="S0520">cos your decisions could actually your input could actually be really really valuable</u>
<u n="261" who="S0519">absolutely so I think I'd like to be part of the next</u>
<u n="262" who="S0520">well now it's kind of more the share shared income isn't it as well?</u>

<u n="364" who="S0519">no I I just have never tested it so I didn't really know how it works</u>
<u n="365" who="S0520">I suppose when you er special it's quite good that <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="366" who="S0519">erm when dad and I just passing <anon type="place"/> here when dad and I went to <anon type="place"/> it is really beautiful and I really liked it but I couldn't imagine living there</u>
<u n="367" who="S0520">really?</u>
<u n="368" who="S0519">and I haven't said it to him except that I I said that erm I didn't feel anything about it except negative things from being near the cotton mills and the er and also it it's like a strange weird thing but as if it's a a barrier being the other side of the M6 it's all</u>
<u n="369" who="S0520">a barrier to what?</u>
<u n="370" who="S0519">like like I don't feel near to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> being on the it it's</u>
<u n="371" who="S0520">like on other side</u>
<u n="372" who="S0519" trans="overlap">I don't on the other side it's just a weird thing but <anon type="place"/>'s the where it always stars to get busy so you you end up that you know you'd have to avoid rush hours and all of those things and and I don't know I just</u>
<u n="373" who="S0520">no I think one hour either side of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you're going to have that problem</u>
<u n="374" who="S0519">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="375" who="S0520">so it's not really a factor</u>
<u n="376" who="S0519">not but I I did I liked it and it was beautiful but I it just felt like a a very foreign place erm like I didn't I didn't know where I was</u>
<u n="377" who="S0520">yeah</u>
<u n="378" who="S0519">erm and my dad I suppose that it it kind of made me realise when we said to my dad we were looking near <anon type="place"/> he said er</u>
<u n="379" who="S0520">why?</u>
<u n="380" who="S0519" trans="overlap">why would you want near <anon type="place"/> <anon type="place"/> it's a horrible place</u>
<u n="381" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="382" who="S0519">and of course it is</u>
<u n="383" who="S0520">well yeah</u>
<u n="384" who="S0519">but but just ten minutes outside it's absolutely beautiful but then you could say the same about a lot of places</u>
<u n="385" who="S0520">yeah especially around here cities aren't nice are they?</u>
<u n="386" who="S0519">no but <anon type="place"/> was a nice little town and er</u>
<u n="387" who="S0520" trans="overlap">oh good I mean maybe you would feel more at home in <anon type="place"/> cos you do come from <anon type="place"/> and you did live in the <anon type="place"/> for all those years</u>
<u n="388" who="S0519">yeah that's right it's it's kind of weird isn't it?</u>
<u n="389" who="S0520">so it kind of makes sense I mean er yeah I mean I don't it makes more sense to me that you would be this side of the of <anon type="place"/> I don't know why but mostly because you have access to the Lake District</u>
<u n="390" who="S0519">but we're going to keep the house</u>
<u n="391" who="S0520">well if you do then yeah</u>
<u n="392" who="S0519">er so suppose what might happen if we went to <anon type="place"/> we might not keep the house because there wouldn't be much point</u>
<u n="393" who="S0520">yeah no I think you're right no that's</u>
<u n="394" who="S0519" trans="overlap">erm because then you could go up to the Lakes so why would you why would you do a</u>
<u n="395" who="S0520">no you wouldn't keep the house</u>
<u n="396" who="S0519">no</u>
<u n="397" who="S0520">unless you wanted to have it in the family but even then it doesn't really make sense does it?</u>
<u n="398" who="S0519">whereas south of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> we would just keep the house and erm</u>
<u n="399" who="S0520">mm</u>
<u n="400" who="S0519">it it there's a lot everything will unfold and what I think will happen is you find a house and you and that is the key factor</u>
<u n="401" who="S0520">yeah that's what I said to dad as well that it's going to be house that probably decides it a little bit you know</u>
<u n="402" who="S0519">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="403" who="S0520">I can imagine you in sort of erm south <anon type="place"/> area it's just a shame that it's not so pretty around there</u>
<u n="404" who="S0519">no that's absolutely right</u>
<u n="405" who="S0520">it's prettyish but it's just kind of plain</u>
<u n="406" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="407" who="S0520">but you would get better climate and you would get erm access to <anon type="place"/> and erm</u>
<u n="408" who="S0519">that's right</u>
<u n="409" who="S0520">south of you know <anon type="place"/> and you should be nearer to grandma as well I mean</u>
<u n="410" who="S0519">mm</u>

<u n="757" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="758" who="S0520">erm the second time he I can't remember his reasons I think I might have made a major error</u>
<u n="759" who="S0519">you made yeah probably</u>

<u n="761" who="S0519">yeah no</u>
<u n="762" who="S0520">so I obviously had good control over the car I just felt <trunc>uncom</trunc></u>
<u n="763" who="S0519" trans="overlap">to be honest I think it's</u>
<u n="764" who="S0520">uncomfortable in certain situations and I think I still would</u>
<u n="765" who="S0519">yeah but I think that's erm</u>
<u n="766" who="S0520" trans="overlap">like traffic <trunc>situa</trunc> erm inner city situations</u>
<u n="767" who="S0519">yeah you hadn't had that yeah</u>
<u n="768" who="S0520">and he should have just taken me to <anon type="place"/> every time</u>
<u n="769" who="S0519">no absolutely and <anon type="place"/>'s quite narrow streets and busy and</u>
<u n="770" who="S0520">yeah</u>

<u n="773" who="S0519">no but even if you drive all-round the town and keep including the route</u>
<u n="774" who="S0520" trans="overlap">yeah yeah it was and I think erm you I could have just done with being driving <trunc>in</trunc> for instance in <anon type="place"/> <anon type="place"/> quite a bit because the situations where I felt less comfortable was where there were lots of junctions there were round you know inside the city one way systems or whatever you know I felt like I didn't quite know how to do that</u>
<u n="775" who="S0519" trans="overlap">no all of that should be cleared up shouldn't it?</u>
<u n="776" who="S0520">massive crossroads and those things</u>
<u n="777" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> used to she didn't like roundabouts and we used to just go on this route with a hundred roundabouts</u>
<u n="778" who="S0520">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="779" who="S0519">erm to over and over and over and over and over</u>
<u n="780" who="S0520">if er if I'd just had a month or so more I could have done it it was just <unclear/> but erm I also lost a lot of confidence</u>
<u n="781" who="S0519">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="782" who="S0520">I could easily do it I don't doubt myself really cos I was always quite comfortable driving but erm just not the situation's not arisen but this kind of scenario just makes me feel frustrated that I can't drive and when I'm in Israel same you know</u>
<u n="783" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="784" who="S0520">like I keep thinking I can't do things a lot of things or it's just more difficult to do them and I always feel like erm dependent on other people as <unclear/> <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="785" who="S0519">but I I you know would it be of any benefit to do the test somewhere else like</u>
<u n="786" who="S0520">yeah maybe</u>
<u n="787" who="S0519">in I I don't mean benefit but would it be easier like if you passed your test in England would you be able to drive in Israel anyway?</u>
<u n="788" who="S0520">yeah I don't know you have to do the international license I think so or you have to do an additional thing maybe to convert it into an international license yeah well this is what I thought you know that I could do it somewhere else as well I don't know how easy it is to convert one to the other</u>
<u n="789" who="S0519">no <pause dur="short"/> and I don't know</u>
