<u n="415" who="S0489">they've got some means and you're conducted to your seat here we are <pause dur="short"/> take you through <pause dur="short"/> it's incredible</u>
<u n="416" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah<pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> that that's good yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="417" who="S0489">you don't get that with British Airways I'm afraid even in first class I don't think you get that but</u>
<u n="418" who="S0523">yeah no</u>
<u n="419" who="S0486" trans="overlap">did er did er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> say we're going first class?</u>
<u n="420" who="S0523">yeah absolutely</u>

<u n="422" who="S0523">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0486" trans="overlap">but the only the only <pause dur="short"/> that was the only flight available first class well it <pause dur="short"/> it erm and in</u>

<u n="425" who="S0486">bank holiday Monday</u>
<u n="426" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="427" who="S0489">so they've probably got a few spare seats in first class</u>
<u n="428" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="429" who="S0486">and on <pause dur="short"/> on the way back we're coming well he probably said we're coming back business class</u>
<u n="430" who="S0489" trans="overlap">business class coming back yeah</u>
<u n="431" who="S0486">so it'll be interesting comparing the two from my point of view I cos could've done all three then couldn't I?</u>
<u n="432" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="433" who="S0489" trans="overlap">well</u>
<u n="434" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="435" who="S0489">my <pause dur="short"/> opinion would be that if you want to sleep <pause dur="short"/> and and have a quiet night business class is probably better than first</u>
<u n="436" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="437" who="S0489">that's assuming as I as I as I recall the first class seats they're nice and wide</u>
<u n="438" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="439" who="S0489">but they don't recline absolutely flat</u>
<u n="440" who="S0486">right</u>
<u n="441" who="S0489">whereas business class beds do</u>
<u n="442" who="S0486">oh do they?</u>
<u n="443" who="S0489">well</u>
<u n="444" who="S0486" trans="overlap">well we don't need to lie down flat on the way out</u>
<u n="445" who="S0489">exactly so</u>
<u n="446" who="S0486" trans="overlap">because we're gonna be there about</u>
<u n="447" who="S0489" trans="overlap">it's the best combination</u>
<u n="448" who="S0486">we're getting there about <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="449" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="450" who="S0486">two o'clock in the morning or something aren't we?</u>
<u n="451" who="S0489">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="452" who="S0486">and so it won't be the whole night that we're there</u>
<u n="453" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah no</u>
<u n="454" who="S0489" trans="overlap">it it it's the best way round really</u>
<u n="455" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="456" who="S0489">first class out and business class back</u>
<u n="457" who="S0523">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="458" who="S0489">in fact I think that's the way I would chose <pause dur="short"/> based on my experience the way</u>
<u n="459" who="S0523">yeah</u>
<u n="460" who="S0489">that's the way I would choose</u>
<u n="461" who="S0523">yeah</u>
<u n="462" who="S0486">can I ask you something and I know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has travelled all over the world and things <pause dur="short"/> and he says that I won't get anywhere with this but do you think I could ask for a special diet on the plane?</u>
<u n="463" who="S0523">well they do ask for er well you could ask I mean there's no harm in asking and and erm I I you know I I I my there is er usually on the form somewhere it says special requests</u>
<u n="464" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="465" who="S0523">whether it's erm <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> you know <trunc>ev</trunc>everything from it erm <pause dur="short"/> types of meal to <pause dur="short"/> but I would have thought <unclear/> first class they would</u>
<u n="466" who="S0489" trans="overlap">first class you can chose whatever you want anyway</u>
<u n="467" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="468" who="S0489">if you ask for a special meal all you'll get is some crummy vegetarian option</u>
<u n="469" who="S0523" trans="overlap">yeah erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="470" who="S0489" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>sorry</unclear></u>
<u n="471" who="S0486">so <pause dur="short"/> so you can get them to deliver you a meal and <pause dur="short"/> and you get the meal and you can't eat any of it so then you say what else have you got? and you keep going through their menu until you get what you want I suppose you could do that on first class couldn't you?</u>
<u n="472" who="S0489" trans="overlap">my</u>
<u n="473" who="S0523">yeah</u>
<u n="474" who="S0489">one thing I would recommend though</u>
<u n="475" who="S0486">mm</u>
<u n="476" who="S0489">and I've done it myself <pause dur="short"/> if you're flying back from somewhere and you want to sleep <pause dur="short"/> choose the the special option I've I've done this before <pause dur="short"/> choose the vegetarian option because you get served first</u>
<u n="477" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="478" who="S0489">which means you can eat your meal <pause dur="short"/> put your blindfold on and try and sleep</u>
<u n="479" who="S0523">mm</u>
<u n="480" who="S0486">yeah</u>
<u n="481" who="S0523">whereas the ordinary food takes a lot longer</u>

<u n="636" who="S0489">whatever you want which <pause dur="short"/> is I think probably <pause dur="short"/> I I suspect there's a general fallacy that <pause dur="short"/> you feed people drink to relax on a long flight</u>
<u n="637" who="S0523" trans="overlap">mm mm mm mm</u>
<u n="638" who="S0489">but of course there comes a point where</u>

<u n="644" who="S0489">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="645" who="S0523" trans="overlap">so you you <pause dur="short"/> we thought we wouldn't want to <pause dur="short"/> risk <pause dur="short"/> erm you know because they say dehydration and all that sort of thing <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="646" who="S0486" trans="overlap">yeah oh yeah</u>
<u n="647" who="S0489" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah absolutely</u>

<u n="649" who="S0523" trans="overlap">mm mm yeah I know</u>
