<u n="1" who="S0132">what should we start talking about?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0035">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> it's funny we've got lots to talk about</u>
<u n="3" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="4" who="S0035">and then suddenly someone says can you talk? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="5" who="S0132">em library fines <pause dur="short"/> what do you think about the library fines? I mean this lady that came to the desk she was  she was  asking for books to be recalled the books that were recalled recalled on her account</u>
<u n="6" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0132">do you think that they should pay charges on it?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0035">God it feels like you're interviewing me <vocal desc="laugh"/> I think the library fines are</u>
<u n="9" who="S0132">it's a bit hefty I mean if you're just not there</u>
<u n="10" who="S0035">bit hefty</u>
<u n="11" who="S0132">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I think if they they need to be advised about the fact that they have to return the book and they have a certain period which might just go</u>
<u n="12" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think we could be maybe a bit clearer</u>
<u n="13" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0035">as to  As to  in in advance that you they're gonna get fined</u>
<u n="15" who="S0132">that's right <pause dur="short"/> because that lady that came today she I mean she she wasn't really aware of the fact that she</u>
<u n="16" who="S0035">no</u>
<u n="17" who="S0132">that's the reason why</u>
<u n="18" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0132">and I had a lady come this morning and she said exactly the same thing</u>
<u n="20" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0132">so</u>
<u n="22" who="S0035">I haven't got anything to say about the library I just sit here and do it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="23" who="S0132">I don't know</u>
<u n="24" who="S0035">you've learned everything quicker than me <pause dur="short"/> I've been here for three years but</u>
<u n="25" who="S0132">you think so?</u>
<u n="26" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0132">and you've just been doing this job for a few months and now now you know more</u>
<u n="28" who="S0035" trans="overlap"><unclear/> Hi</u>
<u n="29" who="S0132">em <pause dur="short"/> I mean <pause dur="short"/> you can't arrange?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0035">no <pause dur="short"/> what arrange to go together?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0132">yeah <pause dur="short"/> unless if you speak to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> cos we have three people in the desk at eleven</u>
<u n="32" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0132">and I can go off like for twenty minutes and just say students come to the</u>
<u n="34" who="S0035">yeah we could ask her couldn't we?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> shall we do a bit now and see how far we can get?</u>
<u n="37" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0035">and if if we can't then we'll</u>
<u n="39" who="S0132">if if it gets busy then we can just eh</u>
<u n="40" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0132">speak to our manager and see what she says</u>
<u n="42" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> she'll say no</u>
<u n="43" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="44" who="S0132">I can't even imagine it actually she's not in today</u>
<u n="45" who="S0035">no she's not</u>
<u n="46" who="S0132">no so it will be <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is quite easy</u>
<u n="47" who="S0035"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is quite <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0132">he'll go oh yeah yeah yeah go ahead <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0035">oh the library? Oh yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0132">sorry <pause dur="short"/> em so there's em <pause dur="short"/> I have it <unclear/> Em how did you how do you find using the library? Do you think it's quite advanced now?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0035">em I yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think cos I go to Leeds Uni as well so I've kinda got a comparison and we've got much better machines and much better em you know like automated things like you know taking your books out</u>
<u n="52" who="S0132">that's right <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0035">and bringing them back and all that</u>
<u n="54" who="S0132">do they have laptops in <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0035">I don't think so <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="56" who="S0132">oh</u>
<u n="57" who="S0035">it's quite old fashioned <pause dur="short"/> but then the other thing is that they don't their sort of staff aren't on show <pause dur="short"/> so if you wanna</u>
<u n="58" who="S0132">oh right</u>
<u n="59" who="S0035">if you want to ask somebody something you have to actually go and find them</u>
<u n="60" who="S0132">okay</u>
<u n="61" who="S0035">so they probably don't get bothered as much so it's the <unclear/></u>
<u n="62" who="S0132">the VD yeah cos they're sort of quite centralised by the <unclear/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> craig said that didn't he?</u>
<u n="64" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="65" who="S0035">well he said that to me he said that oh sat in the middle and</u>
<u n="66" who="S0132">yeah that's right em</u>
<u n="67" who="S0035">yeah but then I suppose it's good cos we have a lot of international students that probably need a bit more help in terms of finding things and language and all that stuff <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="68" who="S0132">and a lot of students said well especially the laptop  they are quite popular for the students I think</u>
<u n="69" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0132">like they like to just sit around different parts of the library</u>
<u n="71" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0132">and just use the laptop rather than</u>
<u n="73" who="S0035">are you serious?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0132">go and sit in the computer room</u>
<u n="75" who="S0035" trans="overlap">at first <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> at first I thought why why do we do laptops? I don't I didn't really think we need them <pause dur="short"/> but then I thought well if you actually built a room full of ninety computers it would take so much room wouldn't it so?</u>
<u n="76" who="S0132">send it through</u>
<u n="77" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="78" who="S0132">and it takes quite a while for those computers to load as well <pause dur="short"/> it takes about twenty minutes</u>
<u n="79" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0132">for the PC to actually load our program yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0035">oh does it?</u>
<u n="82" who="S0132">yeah but when you sign into a laptop it literally takes a few minutes</u>
<u n="83" who="S0035">right <pause dur="short"/> so that's probably why they like them</u>
<u n="84" who="S0132">so they prefer to have that and obviously you can sit <trunc>ar</trunc> anywhere in the library</u>
<u n="85" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0132">so em it gives them that sort of</u>
<u n="87" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0132">em I would I wouldn't mind actually <vocal desc="laugh"/> I would I wouldn't really like to use em a laptop that other people have been using <pause dur="short"/> I would prefer to just bring my own in</u>
<u n="89" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I've forgotten about <pause dur="short"/> like it's sort of hygiene</u>
<u n="90" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's true</u>
<u n="92" who="S0132">Cos you think how many people use the laptops here</u>
<u n="93" who="S0035">yeah I'd probably sneeze all over it or</u>
<u n="94" who="S0132">I know</u>
<u n="95" who="S0035">oh</u>
<u n="96" who="S0132"><vocal desc="laugh"/> You'd have to get them cleaned quite regularly</u>
<u n="97" who="S0035">oh god they probably don't wash their hands do they when they go to the <trunc>toi</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="98" who="S0132">no they don't <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="99" who="S0132">oh <pause dur="short"/> they never</u>
<u n="100" who="S0035">sorry we're talking about</u>
<u n="101" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="102" who="S0035">we're a bit off topic here <vocal desc="laugh"/> Alright okay</u>
<u n="103" who="S0132">oh I think they need to be cleaned on a daily basis</u>
<u n="104" who="S0035">yes</u>
<u n="105" who="S0132">but then we would probably have to do that wouldn't we?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0035">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0132">I don't think I want to <pause dur="short"/> oh I don't think about that when I update the laptops</u>
<u n="108" who="S0035">oh do you do that?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0035">oh sorry <pause dur="short"/> I've put the <unclear/></u>
<u n="111" who="S0132" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I have to yeah <pause dur="short"/> but no  But no but no  I <trunc>o</trunc> I do think about it though <pause dur="short"/> I think about that</u>
<u n="112" who="S0035">oh right</u>
<u n="113" who="S0132">other people have been using it especially students</u>
<u n="114" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0132">and they probably don't clean them</u>
<u n="116" who="S0035">see if you'd not have I said it I would never have thought of that</u>
<u n="117" who="S0132">but it's the same with PCs as well it I mean you</u>
<u n="118" who="S0035">that's true yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0132"><trunc>Whe</trunc> when they're using it a lot of students who come through my desk and say oh I really don't want to use my PC because it's got all sorts of gunk or you know</u>
<u n="120" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0132">people have been eating things and</u>
<u n="122" who="S0035">yeah but yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's true yeah</u>
<u n="123" who="S0132">so that's why I just I don't really know but <pause dur="short"/> I think the hygiene thing is quite a big thing</u>
<u n="124" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="125" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> germs</u>
<u n="126" who="S0132">em I'd say if you were comparing libraries I cos I used to read here at about five years ago</u>
<u n="127" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="128" who="S0132">I graduated in two thousand and six and it's completely different</u>
<u n="129" who="S0035">I think someone took your thesis the other day</u>
<u n="130" who="S0132">my thesis?</u>
<u n="131" who="S0035">possibly</u>
<u n="132" who="S0132">no <pause dur="short"/> there is someone else who's got a thesis</u>
<u n="133" who="S0035">oh</u>
<u n="134" who="S0132">which is the same name as me</u>
<u n="135" who="S0035">oh is there another <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>?</u>
<u n="136" who="S0132">yeah <pause dur="short"/> there is but it's not me</u>
<u n="137" who="S0035">yeah cos I saw it and I thought oh has somebody taken Sabina's?</u>
<u n="138" who="S0132">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that would be great but it's not my thesis</u>
<u n="139" who="S0035">oh</u>
<u n="140" who="S0132">I saw it on the em trolley and I thought it was mine and then it it was someone else's</u>
<u n="141" who="S0035">aw</u>
<u n="142" who="S0132">it was a completely different title altogether</u>
<u n="143" who="S0035">someone took <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s out one week</u>
<u n="144" who="S0132">I know <pause dur="short"/> I remember you were saying <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> hi</u>
<u n="145" who="S0035">yeah we don't have staplers that's an interesting issue <pause dur="short"/> everyone wants a stapler</u>
<u n="146" who="S0132">yeah <pause dur="short"/> the reason why we don't have staplers is because students take the staplers or they break the stapler</u>
<u n="147" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0132">so eh we decided that after as a form of punishment</u>
<u n="149" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="150" who="S0035">students can't be trusted with staplers</u>
<u n="151" who="S0132">with staplers <pause dur="short"/> em we are looking into maybe like a standard sort of heavy duty stapler</u>
<u n="152" who="S0035">oh are we?</u>
<u n="153" who="S0132">but the cost of it is a bit much <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="154" who="S0035">we should like chain them cos we've got these holes in the desk we should get like a chain and</u>
<u n="155" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0035">chain them up</u>
<u n="157" who="S0132">I mean they are available at the other sites <pause dur="short"/> if you go to <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="158" who="S0035">oh are they?</u>
<u n="159" who="S0132">if you go to <anon type="place"/> or <anon type="place"/> they have staplers and they have other stationery there</u>
<u n="160" who="S0035">so that's why they always ask then I suppose?</u>
<u n="161" who="S0132">but because this library is open twenty-four hours the students tend to just come</u>
<u n="162" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0132">and they either take the stapler</u>
<u n="164" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0132">or they just damage the stapler</u>
<u n="166" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="167" who="S0132">which just means other students can't use it</u>
<u n="168" who="S0035">well they take it somewhere else and hide it?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0132">that's right <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="171" who="S0132">so I mean it's</u>
<u n="172" who="S0035">but they don't do it with hole punchers <pause dur="short"/> they seem quite</u>
<u n="173" who="S0132">no</u>
<u n="174" who="S0035">responsible with hole punchers <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0132">yeah <pause dur="short"/> like you you can't really do much with a hole punch can you?</u>
<u n="176" who="S0035">no and why would you want to take a hole punch? You wouldn't really would you?</u>
<u n="177" who="S0132">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="178" who="S0035">it's too heavy</u>
<u n="179" who="S0132">that's true <pause dur="short"/> but did you you know last week did you hear about the graffiti in the?</u>
<u n="180" who="S0035">yes because that room was</u>
<u n="181" who="S0132">that room is locked</u>
<u n="182" who="S0035" trans="overlap">not bookable <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="183" who="S0132">well what happened was that em someone <trunc>w</trunc> what did they put in on that? I don't remember what they they wrote something on the walls or something like  or something <pause dur="short"/> but it wasn't what was written that's not the reason why the room was locked it was because em <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> wanted to make sure that students you know understood that when they used the rooms they needed to make sure that they you know just like everyone else?</u>
<u n="184" who="S0035">mm <pause dur="short"/> so what</u>
<u n="185" who="S0132"><unclear/></u>
<u n="186" who="S0035">so was it cleaned straight away and then they?</u>
<u n="187" who="S0132">it was cleaned  It was cleaned</u>
<u n="188" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="189" who="S0132">but it was just a form of punishment for the</u>
<u n="190" who="S0035">oh</u>
<u n="191" who="S0132">students wouldn't wouldn't graffiti</u>
<u n="192" who="S0035">oh that was quite interesting what you said about that to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> em closing the room</u>
<u n="193" who="UNKFEMALE" whoConfidence="low">sorry can I get the charger bit?</u>
<u n="194" who="S0035">sorry <pause dur="short"/> yeah cos you said <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> shut the room</u>
<u n="195" who="S0132">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's as a form of punishment</u>
<u n="196" who="S0035">as a form of punishment <pause dur="short"/> right well that's it's a good idea kind of but you need to communicate cos people won't know that</u>
<u n="197" who="S0132">well what happened was that the room was shut and then people who were booked in that room were moved to the the other new rooms</u>
<u n="198" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="199" who="S0132">the ones we've got here</u>
<u n="200" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="201" who="S0132">I think it's room six</u>
<u n="202" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="203" who="S0132">and em there aren't any PCs in that room</u>
<u n="204" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="205" who="S0132">so they weren't able to use it and they didn't</u>
<u n="206" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="207" who="S0132">eh a few students came on Friday and they were really annoyed because they wanted to use the PC</u>
<u n="208" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="209" who="S0132">so em what happened was that we had to open the room <pause dur="short"/> but then <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="210" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0132">gave the go-ahead and said they could use the room <vocal desc="laugh"/> and then <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> found out and he was annoyed</u>
<u n="212" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="213" who="S0132">so</u>
<u n="214" who="S0035">but that is a good idea to this idea of like doing something as a consequence of them doing is a good idea but do they <trunc>act</trunc></u>
<u n="215" who="S0132" trans="overlap">they just don't understand why</u>
<u n="216" who="S0035">no <pause dur="short"/> so you need to communicate that</u>
<u n="217" who="S0132">unless they <trunc>le</trunc> have left</u>
<u n="218" who="S0035">a bit better don't you?</u>
<u n="219" who="S0132">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they need us to leave a notice outside the room I think to say why</u>
<u n="220" who="S0035">we're doing  We're doing  a recording for the lady</u>

<u n="300" who="S0132">em and eh we they had to go for a restructure at the time <pause dur="short"/> but before I started like</u>
<u n="301" who="S0035">was this when IT and library became one?</u>

<u n="350" who="S0132">so it all makes sense now</u>
<u n="351" who="S0035">it's all starting to make sense <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="352" who="S0132">we have  We have  different people working in the library on the enquiry desk don't we?</u>
<u n="353" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="354" who="S0132">that have been working here for a long time</u>
<u n="355" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="356" who="S0132">let's hope no one else  <unclear/></u>
<u n="357" who="S0035">I was going to say it's going to get busy about eleven isn't it? Cos</u>
<u n="358" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="359" who="S0035">they change over</u>
<u n="360" who="S0132">of students yeah <pause dur="short"/> did you try and get the <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="361" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> not here though in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="362" who="S0132">in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="363" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> nothing related to the libraries whatsoever <vocal desc="laugh"/> So we can't really talk about that <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="364" who="S0132">so what what are what do you find that the resources at <anon type="place"/> University are?</u>
<u n="365" who="S0035">I think there are more specific books and resources that I need em <pause dur="short"/> but then that's that's due to like the subject nature you know that I don't think that someone would study the thing here that I'm studying at <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="366" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="367" who="S0035">so consequently they haven't got exactly the same books but <pause dur="short"/> there are more general books here actually <pause dur="short"/> so I do get out general books</u>
<u n="368" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="369" who="S0035">there are <trunc>m</trunc> more instructory books like how to  how to  research how to write your thesis how to do this or that or the other</u>
<u n="370" who="S0132">yeah you see I I when I did my <trunc>mas</trunc> when I did it at <anon type="place"/> Met em <pause dur="short"/> I found that the resources there they did have a lot of resources</u>
<u n="371" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="372" who="S0132">but it was the help there</u>
<u n="373" who="S0035">oh right</u>
<u n="374" who="S0132">eh it slightly different because they have an information desk there</u>
<u n="375" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="376" who="S0132">but it's all just sort of general queries and I know our library is slightly smaller than that library as well</u>
<u n="377" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="378" who="S0132">and they've got libraries on different campuses</u>
<u n="379" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="380" who="S0132">so I didn't find it as useful</u>
<u n="381" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="382" who="S0132">and so when I was doing that I was taking books from here rather than there</u>
<u n="383" who="S0035">did you? Yeah cos you were working here at the same time</u>
<u n="384" who="S0132">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="385" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="386" who="S0132">and I just found I've just found it much more convenient</u>
<u n="387" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="388" who="S0132">working here and em I was able to sort of work on my assignments and things like that</u>
<u n="389" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="390" who="S0132">so and I could obviously cos we've got the facilities here we could use the rooms</u>
<u n="391" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="392" who="S0132">and the computer things and</u>
<u n="393" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="394" who="S0132">if I needed to if I need the group rooms I could do that here</u>
<u n="395" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="396" who="S0132">again it was difficult there because they have so many students there</u>
<u n="397" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="398" who="S0132">but they don't have enough facilities</u>
<u n="399" who="S0035">oh</u>
<u n="400" who="S0132">em to accommodate <pause dur="short"/> so whenever we tried to book a room there em it'd be impossible</u>
<u n="401" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="402" who="S0132">because other students would've already use be using the room</u>
<u n="403" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="404" who="S0132">so that's why but em <pause dur="short"/> yeah I think in comparison this library is doing quite well in terms of</u>
<u n="405" who="S0035">yeah I <trunc>thin</trunc></u>
<u n="406" who="S0132">electronic resources eh that we provide as well</u>
<u n="407" who="S0035">but I think they put a lot of money into the library cos I think it's is one of the things that they want <unclear/></u>
<u n="408" who="S0132">it's quite central isn't it to the university so that's probably why but em</u>
<u n="409" who="S0035">Cos it's I think it's one of the strengths that they're trying to sort of play on isn't it of of the</u>
<u n="410" who="S0132">they are <pause dur="short"/> and they do if you think about like during term time especially this site we do get a lot of students coming to the library <pause dur="short"/> it's always quite busy</u>
<u n="411" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="412" who="S0132">and eh whereas eh you find at <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="413" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="414" who="S0132">it's normally during during the summer when it picks up</u>
<u n="415" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="416" who="S0132">and you get a lot of students trying to do</u>
<u n="417" who="S0035">yeah cos they're all on work placements aren't they yeah</u>
<u n="418" who="S0132">work placements and things <pause dur="short"/> em and obviously <anon type="place"/> library which is just always quiet but <vocal desc="laugh"/> I think that's more to do with the fact that because it's small</u>
<u n="419" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="420" who="S0132">and the students there are not they don't really need much help</u>
<u n="421" who="S0035">no</u>
<u n="422" who="S0132">but a lot of students here</u>
<u n="423" who="S0035">I like it over there though</u>
<u n="424" who="S0132">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's better</u>
<u n="425" who="S0035">I do like it</u>
<u n="426" who="S0132">I do like to work <trunc>var</trunc> a variety though</u>
<u n="427" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="428" who="S0132">I do like to work at all different sites</u>
<u n="429" who="S0035">do you?</u>
<u n="430" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="431" who="S0035">yeah</u>

<u n="435" who="S0035">she's done some sneaky trick there</u>
<u n="436" who="S0132">she has yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think a lot of <trunc>pu</trunc> students people that go over there they do want to carrying on work there rather than come back to this site because it's so busy yeah</u>
<u n="437" who="S0035">yeah not surprised yeah <pause dur="short"/> I've only done one shift up there I was just like oh bliss love it <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> It's like I've been on holiday</u>
<u n="438" who="S0132">it is but here you just get a lot of foreign students coming to the desk who are not quite sure what to do</u>
<u n="439" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="440" who="S0132">but at the same time a lot of students which are business students complain about the littlest things like fines and you know</u>
<u n="441" who="S0035">yeah well business yeah</u>
<u n="442" who="S0132">you don't really get that  you don't really get that  at that site you don't</u>

<u n="455" who="S0035">I don't know people are different aren't they? Depending on what they sort of choose to do in life I think yeah</u>
<u n="456" who="S0132">choose to do <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos you get a lot of mature students at <anon type="place"/> library</u>

<u n="489" who="S0035">yes</u>
<u n="490" who="S0132">the ones that em cos they look like cash machines <pause dur="short"/> I think when they first came well when they first put them in</u>
<u n="491" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="492" who="S0132">em a lot of students thought they were cash machines <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="493" who="S0035">I wish they were I wish we had cash machines</u>
<u n="494" who="S0132" trans="overlap">they got quite yeah <pause dur="short"/> they do look like it <pause dur="short"/> you still get students now coming to the desk and asking where to return their books and they've even got sort of like blue lights</u>
<u n="495" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="496" who="S0132">which and it's got a return at the top</u>
<u n="497" who="S0035">I don't like being left to our own in resources</u>
<u n="498" who="S0132">do you not?</u>
<u n="499" who="S0035">oh she's disappeared <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="500" who="S0132">I know</u>
<u n="501" who="S0035">Cos then I feel like oh I haven't actually got anything to say about the library at all <pause dur="short"/> so have you got a proper like librarian qualification then?</u>
<u n="502" who="S0132">I have yeah <pause dur="short"/> I got the Masters</u>
<u n="503" who="S0035">oh get you <pause dur="short"/> expert</u>
<u n="504" who="S0132">oh <vocal desc="laugh"/> Well the library course is not anything to do with the library</u>
<u n="505" who="S0035">is it not?</u>
<u n="506" who="S0132">no</u>
<u n="507" who="S0035"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> says that actually</u>
<u n="508" who="S0132">it's more to do with the em searching and creating sort of search engines</u>
<u n="509" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="510" who="S0132">and like that em</u>
<u n="511" who="S0035">oh right so is it actually like</u>
<u n="512" who="S0132">we we've done some <trunc>bo</trunc> business matter <trunc>bo</trunc> <trunc>be</trunc> business modules as well</u>
<u n="513" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="514" who="S0132">it's was sort of variety of things</u>
<u n="515" who="S0035">but nothing that you would use every day or?</u>
<u n="516" who="S0132">I can't really yeah I can't really think of anything I mean what I did my dissertation on the em library reading list system LaSU</u>
<u n="517" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="518" who="S0132">which I thought was quite useful at the time</u>
<u n="519" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="520" who="S0132">but I'm not sure how how much students use it though</u>
<u n="521" who="S0035">I don't know</u>
<u n="522" who="S0132">and whether they find it useful <pause dur="short"/> I never cos I thought on the desk before I started working I thought you'd get a lot of students</u>
<u n="523" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="524" who="S0132">coming to my desk asking about it</u>
<u n="525" who="S0035">we did for a while actually there was quite quite a lot for a while</u>
<u n="526" who="S0132">but then it's yeah it's quite <trunc>ni</trunc></u>
<u n="527" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="528" who="S0132">and it is working in acquisitions it is em they do it a lot actually with LaSU</u>
<u n="529" who="S0035">do they?</u>
<u n="530" who="S0132">yeah say em you know ordering books and things it's all based on reading list system</u>
<u n="531" who="S0035">but the thing is even if we even if they don't access the reading list through the library site they they're still getting books on the reading list and they've got the reading list on paper haven't they? So we might not know that it's <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="532" who="S0132">on the reading list but that's why they go <pause dur="short"/> that's what it's</u>
<u n="533" who="S0035" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but that that's what it's yeah</u>
<u n="534" who="S0132">Cos all the formulas and everything that we em order books are are based on the reading lists</u>
<u n="535" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="536" who="S0132">em and the lecturers whereas in the past it used to be where the lecturer would give the student numbers <pause dur="short"/> now we have to work out the formula</u>
<u n="537" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="538" who="S0132">I say we but acquisitions have to work out the formula</u>
<u n="539" who="S0035">what does that mean then?</u>
<u n="540" who="S0132">it's the formula that's given according to the number of students</u>
<u n="541" who="S0035">oh I see</u>
<u n="542" who="S0132">that are on the course</u>
<u n="543" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="544" who="S0132">so and that's how they order the books</u>
<u n="545" who="S0035">so that's quite good <pause dur="short"/> cos I'm <trunc>si</trunc> I'm doing a bit of lecturing at <anon type="place"/> and I'm teaching a course and it's all these different lectures on it</u>
<u n="546" who="S0132">yes</u>
<u n="547" who="S0035">and this one guy and he hasn't put  he hasn't put  his em reading on the VLE so they can't get it <pause dur="short"/> so it's just in the library</u>
<u n="548" who="S0132">right</u>
<u n="549" who="S0035">a hundred and twenty <trunc>cou</trunc> students on that course</u>
<u n="550" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="551" who="S0035">one book <pause dur="short"/> standard loan <pause dur="short"/> so I was like I'm teaching the course I've not even read it</u>
<u n="552" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="553" who="S0035">so I'm like going I can't take this book out</u>
<u n="554" who="S0132">no</u>
<u n="555" who="S0035">Cos all these students want to take it</u>
<u n="556" who="S0132" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> all the students yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0035">yeah I've got to reserve it but it just seems mean doesn't it?</u>
<u n="558" who="S0132">well you get that you get but the <trunc>stu</trunc> some of the students will come and they'll probably be about thirty forty books</u>
<u n="559" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="560" who="S0132">and there's a maximum I think twenty is the maximum of books that you can order</u>
<u n="561" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="562" who="S0132">and I remember a few students coming to my desk complaining saying that there weren't enough cos the students were borrowing the books but actually the the books that are available in the library are only supposed to be for reference</u>
<u n="563" who="S0035">right</u>
<u n="564" who="S0132">if they've got core texts they need to purchase the core texts</u>
<u n="565" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well that's true they forget that don't they? Yeah</u>
<u n="566" who="S0132">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but they treat the core text and they'll they'll sort of think oh we'll just get it from the library and we'll just use it throughout the course but it doesn't work like that</u>
<u n="567" who="S0035">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="568" who="S0132">and that's why</u>
<u n="569" who="S0035">not if you've gotta use it throughout <pause dur="short"/> you've gotta buy it</u>
<u n="570" who="S0132">no <pause dur="short"/> and that's why we try to advise them that you know whatever <trunc>she</trunc></u>
<u n="571" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="572" who="S0132">says core text the students really are expected to purchase them</u>
<u n="573" who="S0035">yeah</u>
<u n="574" who="S0132">especially when they're making reservations <pause dur="short"/> they'll be putting reservations on</u>
<u n="575" who="S0035">mm</u>
<u n="576" who="S0132">some of the books</u>
<u n="577" who="S0035">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="578" who="S0132">and you know they'll come back and say why? I want to use it for longer and you think well <trunc>ev</trunc> yeah other students want to use it too</u>
<u n="579" who="S0035">yeah like when they go oh I've I've read it I've not had a chance to read it</u>
<u n="580" who="S0132">yeah</u>
<u n="581" who="S0035">and it's like really important</u>
<u n="582" who="S0132">no</u>
<u n="583" who="S0035">you're like well that's why everyone needs it isn't it?</u>
<u n="584" who="S0132">that's right yeah why it's better to purchase it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
