<u n="2" who="S0084">yeah in the jam</u>
<u n="3" who="S0083">fruit in the jam in the juice in anything really</u>
<u n="4" who="S0084">yoghurts</u>
<u n="5" who="S0083">yes <pause dur="short"/> it shouldn't be there</u>
<u n="6" who="S0084">I don't like the yoghurts with bits in</u>
<u n="7" who="S0083">with bits in <pause dur="short"/> I mean they're it's fruit</u>
<u n="8" who="S0084">yeah it's</u>
<u n="9" who="S0083">you're meant to eat fruit</u>
<u n="10" who="S0084">fruit <pause dur="short"/> no I don't like it</u>
<u n="11" who="S0083">oh dear <pause dur="short"/> I thought you'd improved</u>
<u n="12" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="13" who="S0083">well clearly not</u>
<u n="14" who="S0084">no no no no no</u>
<u n="15" who="S0083" trans="overlap">and how are you?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0084">I'm exhausted</u>
<u n="17" who="S0083">are you?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0084">ah I've just had the supplier coming around to <pause dur="short"/> well when I say we I had to do a review meeting</u>
<u n="19" who="S0083">mm mm</u>
<u n="20" who="S0084">and my brain aches <pause dur="short"/> I've been dreading it for about a month</u>
<u n="21" who="S0083">oh dear</u>
<u n="22" who="S0084">I woke up with like a sick feeling butterflies</u>
<u n="23" who="S0083" trans="overlap">oh no</u>
<u n="24" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah I've been really dreading it because I had to lead the meeting</u>
<u n="25" who="S0083">oh</u>
<u n="26" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0083">my daughter the manager</u>
<u n="28" who="S0084">mm hardly but</u>
<u n="29" who="S0083">you're so capable and</u>
<u n="30" who="S0084">I'm not I want to cry</u>
<u n="31" who="S0083">oh I think this is excellent</u>
<u n="32" who="S0084">it's horrible</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="33" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> horri-bubble <pause dur="short"/> but it was good it was erm because we've reached the end of two of our projects that they've been project managing for us</u>
<u n="34" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="35" who="S0084">and we're replacing the typesetter the typesetting work with Indian suppliers</u>
<u n="36" who="S0083">oh excellent</u>
<u n="37" who="S0084">yup because they're five pounds a page rather than twenty-five pounds a page which UK suppliers are</u>
<u n="38" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0084">but they're rubbish so it's a completely</u>
<u n="40" who="S0083">well yes</u>
<u n="41" who="S0084">false economy</u>
<u n="42" who="S0083"><trunc>E</trunc> exactly</u>
<u n="43" who="S0084">erm so we're looking at ways of making it a bit easier for them looking at ways looking at how they've really let us down and</u>
<u n="44" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0084">because it was the first time we've used this project management company and the guy the MD used to work in-house</u>
<u n="46" who="S0083">right</u>
<u n="47" who="S0084">A really nice guy</u>
<u n="48" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0084">he used to work in like our academic division so he knows <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> my old boss because she worked in academic</u>
<u n="50" who="S0083">mm mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">and another one of the erm one of my er colleagues who is on maternity leave at the moment <pause dur="short"/> there's another production controller so it was good for him to come in and</u>
<u n="52" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0084">for us to say like we're all a bit concerned about these issues <pause dur="short"/> how have you found it because he's essentially the buffer between us and the typesetter so he deals with a lot of their queries <pause dur="short"/> but I think actually in reality the biggest problem is they don't query stuff so when it comes in it's not it's substandard and they haven't raised</u>
<u n="54" who="S0083">oh dear</u>
<u n="55" who="S0084">any concerns <pause dur="short"/> so erm we've done two of the six titles so far erm so it was a good point to just take stock and hold a review <pause dur="short"/> so my boss <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> called in from the States which she had to leave after half an hour because of training <pause dur="short"/> but she's dealing with the same one of the same suppliers in New York and for some reason that I don't understand in New York they erm they've placed all their work with one supplier <pause dur="short"/> which is they did it before with a company called Adventure House and they went bust</u>
<u n="56" who="S0083">oh</u>
<u n="57" who="S0084">which is not what you want really because they've got all your files all your formats all your covers</u>
<u n="58" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0084">all your body files <pause dur="short"/> and they have it and now they've asked erm and obviously you don't you can't by spreading yourself around by spreading the work around you force competition so you get better rates <pause dur="short"/> so if you're thinking with your business head on</u>
<u n="60" who="S0083" trans="overlap">has erm yeah yeah I mean that is obviously what you're supposed to do</u>
<u n="61" who="S0084">obviously you want to build relationships with people because then you understand each other you know each other you rely on each other and they understand your product</u>
<u n="62" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0084">but you know we have  we have  about four or five different suppliers in the UK</u>
<u n="64" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0084">we have about three or four Indian suppliers that we're starting to place work with <pause dur="short"/> erm so</u>
<u n="66" who="S0083">are they improving though?</u>
<u n="67" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0083">not really? No</u>
<u n="69" who="S0084">one of them is rubbish</u>
<u n="70" who="S0083" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> used to erm complain about doing that cos they're you know all companies do it <pause dur="short"/> she said the paper is poor quality the ink is <trunc>b</trunc> of poor quality</u>
<u n="71" who="S0084" trans="overlap">well luckily they don't erm control that</u>
<u n="72" who="S0083">alright</u>
<u n="73" who="S0084">I mean they literally do the design</u>
<u n="74" who="S0083">right</u>
<u n="75" who="S0084">erm and the products that we have and working on should in theory be extremely straightforward because they've practise tests in Cambridge ESOL <pause dur="short"/> so Cambridge ESOL</u>
<u n="76" who="S0083">oh I see</u>
<u n="77" who="S0084">supply us with the exams</u>
<u n="78" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0084">we copy edit it erm we'll put our copyright line in <trunc>w</trunc> you know we jazz it up a bit we lay it out <pause dur="short"/> erm and that's it it should be a relatively straightforward piece of work <pause dur="short"/> for some reason they're getting it wrong you know we've found today with the set of proofs that they're copying and pasting from one</u>
<u n="80" who="S0083">no</u>
<u n="81" who="S0084">set of proofs to another and so you've got half of one exam and half of another <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's just awful it's really basic</u>
<u n="82" who="S0083">but that's really bad</u>
<u n="83" who="S0084">bog standard stuff</u>
<u n="84" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0084">particularly because we're we're we're moving into a digital age where if we supply a Word document it's already styled so that they can flow it straight into their template in their design template</u>
<u n="86" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0084">they're not doing that even though it's that would be the easiest thing to do <pause dur="short"/> sorry am I boring you?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0083">no I'm I am listening</u>
<u n="89" who="S0084" trans="overlap">what are you doing? You're not listening you're playing <unclear/></u>
<u n="90" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I am</u>
<u n="91" who="S0084">put the TV on then</u>
<u n="92" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I am listening</u>
<u n="93" who="S0084">er anyway so yeah so they came in and we had a chat</u>
<u n="94" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0084">end of story <pause dur="short"/> it was long it started at two</u>
<u n="96" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0084">and gradually everyone had to go to another meeting so there was just me and Joe <pause dur="short"/> it was fine <pause dur="short"/> I'm glad it's over but it was really useful</u>
<u n="98" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0084">cos it was a I think he's taken stuff away and we've taken stuff away so</u>
<u n="100" who="S0083">Good</u>
<u n="101" who="S0084">it was good</u>
<u n="102" who="S0083">are you going to be doing more with these now? Is this this is gonna be part of your life now doing meetings like this</u>
<u n="103" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I hate it</u>
<u n="104" who="S0083">oh you don't hate it it's just  it's just</u>
<u n="105" who="S0084" trans="overlap">I do hate it it makes me feel sick</u>
<u n="106" who="S0083">it makes you a bit nervous that's all but</u>
<u n="107" who="S0084">that's why <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is insisting I go on this presentation skills workshop which is awful <pause dur="short"/> you have to give a presentation in the morning and she said when they'd confirmed my place and she sent me an email to say now you must remember that I did my presentation on Ladybird books and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> did hers on baking so you've got a really high standard to maintain here <pause dur="short"/> but a talk for about five minutes on whatever you fancy erm and then you do the workshop and then you have to give a presentation on your job at the end of the day <pause dur="short"/> but you should come prepared with some material and then you hone it during the day <pause dur="short"/> so so she said it was really useful I mean I'm dreading that <pause dur="short"/> there's gonna be role-play and</u>
<u n="108" who="S0083">yes <pause dur="short"/> oh this is your business</u>
<u n="109" who="S0084">all that horrendous stuff</u>
<u n="110" who="S0083">life now</u>
<u n="111" who="S0084">I hate it</u>
<u n="112" who="S0083">oh</u>
<u n="113" who="S0084">but while those courses are available and they're not free</u>
<u n="114" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0084">but you know they could be <pause dur="short"/> they're free for me</u>
<u n="116" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0084">the department pays</u>
<u n="118" who="S0083">exactly <pause dur="short"/> we'll take them up on it</u>
<u n="119" who="S0084">but you might as well</u>
<u n="120" who="S0083">just think of erm <pause dur="short"/> I always think this is so funny and <trunc>w</trunc> I can't <pause dur="short"/> I think her name was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> wasn't it? In <anon type="place"/> when she works in the office</u>
<u n="121" who="S0084">mm mm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0083">and she has to give that presentation and she has the circle</u>
<u n="123" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="124" who="S0083">and <unclear/></u>
<u n="125" who="S0084">did she say what are we doing?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0083">yes <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember when it was  it was  <trunc>j</trunc> it was ridiculous</u>
<u n="127" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> and they all applauded</u>
<u n="128" who="S0083">and and they all applauded yeah <pause dur="short"/> that was so funny</u>
<u n="129" who="S0084">and she asked everybody what are  what are  we doing here?</u>
<u n="130" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0084">what what is this job? And no no one tells her no one can answer her</u>
<u n="132" who="S0083">but it's all just  it's all just  words and they don't mean anything and the idea is they don't mean anything and erm names for things that don't mean anything is actually all of it is just meaningless</u>
<u n="133" who="S0084" trans="overlap">erm and they just business-speak is so stupid the</u>
<u n="134" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0084">the things that they say like I was in a meeting with erm it was when I was being a PA for Geoff and I was taking minutes and he was talking about something or other and he said we'll take this offline <pause dur="short"/> which just means we'll talk about it later</u>
<u n="136" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0084">why not just say that?</u>
<u n="138" who="S0083">I know</u>
<u n="139" who="S0084">or or going forward or what</u>
<u n="140" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="141" who="S0084">you know?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0083">it's all just jargon and</u>
<u n="143" who="S0084">all management-speak it's just</u>
<u n="144" who="S0083">business-speak and</u>
<u n="145" who="S0084">you just sound like an idiot</u>
<u n="146" who="S0083">it's it's all horrible <pause dur="short"/> I hate it</u>
<u n="147" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> we've got to you've got to embrace it though if you want to get ahead</u>
<u n="148" who="S0083">I suppose you do</u>
<u n="149" who="S0084">and maybe it just happens one night you just wake up and you speak like an idiot</u>
<u n="150" who="S0083"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="151" who="S0084">that's what I'm worried about</u>
<u n="152" who="S0083">I think  I think  it's if you're in that environment you just it's you just become like that</u>
<u n="153" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0083">and you start speaking like them</u>
<u n="155" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0083">so watch it <pause dur="short"/> we'll pull you up on it if we <trunc>s</trunc> if we</u>
<u n="157" who="S0084">well I already told you that I felt sick the the other week when I had to erm knock down one of our UK suppliers</u>
<u n="158" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0084">on their price <pause dur="short"/> they'd quoted fifteen pounds a page which actually is <trunc>incredib</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> no actually thirty pounds a page for a for quite a difficult complex book</u>
<u n="160" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="161" who="S0084">and I <trunc>n</trunc> I had to knock them down to twenty-five</u>
<u n="162" who="S0083">mm mm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0084">and they are <pause dur="short"/> we went to see them and they're really nice have got a really nice set up but they're struggling for work like they keep emailing saying if you've got any projects you know we could handle anything any size shape whatever <pause dur="short"/> and you know that actually they've got a lot of overheads in the they expanded I don't know if it was last year or the <trunc>y</trunc> year before at a time when we are looking to</u>
<u n="164" who="S0083">but they they're obviously struggling now</u>
<u n="165" who="S0084">offshore <pause dur="short"/> and they're struggling and so but you saying well I would pay thirty pounds but I know that because you're struggling you'll take twenty-five</u>
<u n="166" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="167" who="S0084">and you're not  you're not  cutting off</u>
<u n="168" who="S0083">it's horrible isn't it?</u>
<u n="169" who="S0084">their hands but it just makes you feel sick</u>
<u n="170" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="171" who="S0084">and you think well that's <trunc>w</trunc> basically what you have to do</u>
<u n="172" who="S0083">it is horrible mm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0084">I mean it's not  it's not  erm it's not it wouldn't be a problem to pay thirty pounds a page because that's what you would expect to pay</u>
<u n="174" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0084">but we did say to them when we went to meet them that erm you know we are being asked to <pause dur="short"/> the dictat from on high is</u>
<u n="176" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0084">offshore where possible</u>
<u n="178" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="179" who="S0084">erm and if and our argument is it's a false economy because</u>
<u n="180" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="181" who="S0084">the amount of time we've spent in man hours liaising with them and answering the most basic of queries and sending stuff back when it's wrong</u>
<u n="182" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="183" who="S0084">you know to pay a production controller's salary you might as well freelance it out to a get</u>
<u n="184" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="185" who="S0084">UK supplier and get it right first time someone who knows you</u>
<u n="186" who="S0083">well yes</u>
<u n="187" who="S0084">it's just</u>
<u n="188" who="S0083">sometimes it is just a false economy</u>
<u n="189" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> we were saying that they'd have to come and come down on their prices</u>
<u n="190" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="191" who="S0084">if they wanted to keep the work and it's probably what they're gonna have to do</u>
<u n="192" who="S0083">it's very hard though cos you know small companies er will really struggle in this kind of climate</u>
<u n="193" who="S0084">and really at this time you want to be placing work</u>
<u n="194" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="195" who="S0084">with suppliers you trust and</u>
<u n="196" who="S0083">you would think so but it</u>

<u n="439" who="S0084">and he's been the one to write it himself though</u>
<u n="440" who="S0083">I think it's interesting <pause dur="short"/> I think the the broken ankle is actually quite erm crucial <pause dur="short"/> I think what that's done is that erm they've obviously not been performing and I think he's had some time</u>
<u n="441" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="442" who="S0083">and I think he's had some space to actually you know go off on his own</u>

<u n="444" who="S0083">and write the letter</u>
<u n="445" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="448" who="S0083">and not that he <pause dur="short"/> you know I mean he obviously enjoys that and is <trunc>ha</trunc> happy about it</u>
<u n="449" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="450" who="S0083">but</u>
<u n="451" who="S0084">it doesn't leave much room for anybody else</u>

<u n="454" who="S0083">erm no he has he had a a daughter <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> is his second wife and he married erm er a woman called June and they had a little girl called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who is about I think  I think  she was born ten years after me <pause dur="short"/> erm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> wasn't sure whether it was sixty-seven sixty-eight or sixty-nine but</u>

<u n="457" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="458" who="S0083">that sort of time <pause dur="short"/> erm erm and then they got divorced and he married <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> so erm but one of the things that that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said when she wrote cos she did write <pause dur="short"/> I mean she said</u>
<u n="459" who="S0084">oh and there was</u>
<u n="460" who="S0083">that it was from the both of them</u>
<u n="461" who="S0084" trans="overlap">both but it was her and not him</u>
<u n="462" who="S0083">but it was you know she said oh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has asked me to do this erm but it was  it was  clearly from her</u>
<u n="463" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="464" who="S0083">I mean he might well have done he might have <pause dur="short"/> I mean I presume it was a a shock</u>
<u n="465" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="466" who="S0083">but anyway erm I mean she knew about me but</u>
<u n="467" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="468" who="S0083">anyway <pause dur="short"/> and so she's I think she's  I think she's  quite difficult and I think you know that's where there's going to be a problem</u>
<u n="469" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="470" who="S0083">erm she didn't get on with her and erm I think her name is Samantha <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure it is yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> didn't get on with her <pause dur="short"/> now what she said was that Samantha never accepted her but basically they've cut her out of their lives</u>
<u n="471" who="S0084" trans="overlap">oh I didn't know this</u>
<u n="472" who="S0083">she said oh it's very sad and it's very you know all the rest of it <pause dur="short"/> but that you know that's what she wants to do and we have to live with that kind of thing <pause dur="short"/> and I'm thinking mm it sounds like it's probably the other way around</u>
<u n="473" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="474" who="S0083">erm and I was quite shocked that you know that he would be okay with that but</u>
<u n="475" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="476" who="S0083">maybe he's one of these men anything for a quiet life</u>
<u n="477" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="478" who="S0083">I get the feeling he probably is</u>
<u n="479" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="480" who="S0083">erm so she wouldn't er she wouldn't say anything about her <pause dur="short"/> now what I would like to do is is actually ask him you know in a very sort of gentle way I know you know things are <trunc>diffi</trunc> difficult between them</u>
<u n="481" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="482" who="S0083">but would he be okay could he give me her you know an address or or something so that I could contact her? Would he be okay with that? You know I don't  I don't  I'm not gonna force the issue with them</u>
<u n="483" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="484" who="S0083">but would he mind if I did because I would like to contact my sister <pause dur="short"/> so and I as you <trunc>sa</trunc> as you say I mean this came totally out of the blue and I'd really just resigned myself to the fact that they didn't want to know and that was that there's nothing I could do about it</u>
<u n="485" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="486" who="S0083">I mean I suppose if I did have the money I could have gone out there and and it might have been awkward <pause dur="short"/> it's a long way to go if you're not sure of your welcome <pause dur="short"/> erm it would have forced the issue wouldn't it? But but anyway erm but I had kind of got used to the idea and that was that you know so but this does open up all kinds of things again which is nice</u>
<u n="487" who="S0084" trans="overlap">very exciting</u>
<u n="488" who="S0083">which is nice <pause dur="short"/> I I mean I'm really pleased</u>
<u n="489" who="S0084">it's really good</u>
<u n="490" who="S0083">I was very touched <pause dur="short"/> very touched especially you know when he  when he  addressed it and I thought oh you know that's</u>
<u n="491" who="S0084">yeah of course</u>
<u n="492" who="S0083">I was quite emotional about that</u>
<u n="493" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="494" who="S0083">very emotional about it so</u>
<u n="495" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah it's a really nice way to open the letter</u>
<u n="496" who="S0083">it is <pause dur="short"/> I mean I know the rest of it is a bit odd but anyway</u>
<u n="497" who="S0084">well I mean how old is he</u>
<u n="498" who="S0083">it's it's really nice</u>
<u n="499" who="S0084">anyway?</u>
<u n="500" who="S0083">he's eighty-one</u>
<u n="501" who="S0084">well there you go</u>
<u n="502" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="503" who="S0084">he probably is a bit bananas</u>
<u n="504" who="S0083"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="505" who="S0084">he lives out in Australia</u>
<u n="506" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="507" who="S0084">it is in Queensland and they're all <trunc>b</trunc> bananas</u>
<u n="508" who="S0083">yeah well maybe <pause dur="short"/> well I certainly think erm if you go out there next year you should go you know</u>
<u n="509" who="S0084">well only if you think that that's okay</u>
<u n="510" who="S0083">have a  have a  weekend <pause dur="short"/> oh I <trunc>d</trunc> I absolutely do I think I mean presumably there might have been a couple more letters by that stage</u>
<u n="511" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="512" who="S0083">erm and you know you should do that <pause dur="short"/> whether I'll ever have the money to do it is another matter entirely so</u>
<u n="513" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="514" who="S0083">because I can't imagine how much the flight might be?</u>
<u n="515" who="S0084">it depends when you want to go <pause dur="short"/> I mean the good thing is</u>
<u n="516" who="S0083">well I'd go when it wasn't hot so</u>
<u n="517" who="S0084">yeah exactly <pause dur="short"/> well yeah I mean Queensland would be okay because it's halfway down on the east</u>
<u n="518" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="519" who="S0084">like if you were if it was the north</u>
<u n="520" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="521" who="S0084">then it would always be hot because it's the tropics <pause dur="short"/> but yeah I mean if you went on standby if you just went on the hope that you might be able to get a seat obviously you can buy them at the airport and they're cheaper because they just want to fill up the the flight</u>
<u n="522" who="S0083">really?</u>
<u n="523" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> remember when Will and Emma were living in Melbourne and were saying you can get like you know just come out on standby because obviously I was a student then <pause dur="short"/> and they just oh just wait</u>
<u n="524" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="525" who="S0084">you know to come out and go on a day when you know if you think like mid-week and it's not going to be very busy and they're gonna have empty seats on the plane</u>
<u n="526" who="S0083">but you'd have to be prepared to go there every day you know on the off-chance of</u>
<u n="527" who="S0084">on the off-chance</u>
<u n="528" who="S0083">of getting</u>
<u n="529" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="530" who="S0083">I mean that's that's quite a risk</u>
<u n="531" who="S0084">it is quite a risk <pause dur="short"/> that's why people don't do it if you work obviously because if they've</u>
<u n="532" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="533" who="S0084">only got two weeks and you need to guarantee you've got a holiday</u>
<u n="534" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> but if if I mean is it better to book way ahead or</u>
<u n="535" who="S0084">I still don't know</u>
<u n="536" who="S0083">nearer the time?</u>
<u n="537" who="S0084">erm I mean they do often do deals</u>
<u n="538" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="539" who="S0084">I mean I'm gonna try and keep an eye out for British Airways <pause dur="short"/> but my colleague Steve flew to Cuba recently</u>
<u n="540" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="541" who="S0084">on a holiday there and I was so jealous <pause dur="short"/> erm and he booked with what he thought were British Airways and I said</u>
<u n="542" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="543" who="S0084">british Airways I don't think fly to Cuba but he said yeah yeah it's British Airways <pause dur="short"/> okay fine</u>
<u n="544" who="S0083">I didn't think you could go straight there isn't that what you found?</u>
<u n="545" who="S0084">no you can't go from America</u>
<u n="546" who="S0084">oh from oh okay</u>
<u n="547" who="S0084" trans="overlap">you can go from here but it's Virgin</u>
<u n="548" who="S0083">right <pause dur="short"/> oh I see</u>
<u n="549" who="S0084">which is who I flew with erm or like a tin can</u>
<u n="550" who="S0083">right</u>
<u n="551" who="S0084">but you don't want to be doing that</u>
<u n="552" who="S0083">no</u>
<u n="553" who="S0084">it turned out British Airways put their name erm to other airlines and you think you're flying with British Airways but you're not</u>
<u n="554" who="S0083">no</u>
<u n="555" who="S0084">so Steve ended up flying with some bucket shop erm tin can</u>
<u n="556" who="S0083">surely that's illegal?</u>
<u n="557" who="S0084">which must be illegal so he's following it up with the airline because there's no way they would have gone <pause dur="short"/> because they got really good deals and they thought this is brilliant British Airways fantastic <pause dur="short"/> get to the airport and they find out they're on some sort of</u>
<u n="558" who="S0083">how can they do that?</u>
<u n="559" who="S0084">little tin can</u>
<u n="560" who="S0083">that's so unethical</u>
<u n="561" who="S0084">so one screen for the whole cabin it's really bad <pause dur="short"/> it's it's er basically it's erm trade descriptions act isn't it?</u>
<u n="562" who="S0083">that's outrageous</u>
<u n="563" who="S0084" trans="overlap">because they're saying you're getting your British Airways flight and you're not</u>
<u n="564" who="S0083">that is outrageous</u>
<u n="565" who="S0084">so he's gonna follow up with that because that's just absolutely shocking</u>
<u n="566" who="S0083">he'll write to er Anne bloody Robinson</u>
<u n="567" who="S0084">yeah she'll take it up she loves a good cause <pause dur="short"/> so erm with er well when I flew to Australia obviously I got a cheap deal <pause dur="short"/> in fact it wasn't cheap I just flew with someone who I was the cheapest of the lot but really I flew at a peak time so I'm just</u>
<u n="568" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="569" who="S0084">wondering if you flew in the middle of the year</u>
<u n="570" who="S0083" trans="overlap">you did you thought erm you knew you'd paid quite a lot because you went out on Boxing Day didn't you?</u>
<u n="571" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah my flight was a thousand pounds and that was with an airline who only had one screen in the whole cabin and</u>
<u n="572" who="S0083">oh my God</u>
<u n="573" who="S0084">that was like budget <pause dur="short"/> but when I flew to New Zealand it was about I think it was about six hundred pounds return</u>
<u n="574" who="S0083">that's just <trunc>t</trunc> I can't imagine spending all that money on that <pause dur="short"/> cos you need  you need  money when you're out there</u>
<u n="575" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="576" who="S0083">my God</u>
<u n="577" who="S0084">but if you went during the year but yeah it probably would be about a thousand pounds by the time you <pause dur="short"/> I I mean if you depending on how you feel about it and how they feel about it whether you can stay with them you're gonna have to get accommodation</u>
<u n="578" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="579" who="S0084">and spending money <pause dur="short"/> so it'll be yeah a thousand pounds fifteen hundred pounds</u>
<u n="580" who="S0083">oh God</u>
<u n="581" who="S0084">so yeah I mean maybe in the letter you would write back and say yeah I'll I'll certainly be saving some money so I'm not quite sure when blah blah</u>
<u n="582" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="583" who="S0084">erm oh are they coming to the UK any time soon? And then <unclear/></u>
<u n="584" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I think she would say if he was I think they're probably not</u>
<u n="585" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> I mean if he's saying that he still owes as much of his mortgage</u>
<u n="586" who="S0083">I mean he's got</u>
<u n="587" who="S0084">as he did when he was twenty</u>
<u n="588" who="S0083">I think it's you see I think she immediately thought</u>
<u n="589" who="S0084">you were after his money</u>
<u n="590" who="S0083">I was after an inheritance which is ridiculous</u>
<u n="591" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="592" who="S0083">but she immediately thought that because she made several comments <pause dur="short"/> not directly</u>
<u n="593" who="S0084">directly yeah</u>
<u n="594" who="S0083">but you know obliquely</u>
<u n="595" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="596" who="S0083">erm erm and I think he that that might be a way of him saying you know I couldn't help you you know?</u>
<u n="597" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="598" who="S0083">could you know because otherwise he he might have suggested but now anyway</u>
<u n="599" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm</u>

<u n="602" who="S0083">excuse me <pause dur="short"/> erm so yeah oh I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I might win on the premium bonds but I rather doubt it <pause dur="short"/> but I mean <trunc>y</trunc> you know he hasn't got any family here now you know? Obviously his parents have <trunc>di</trunc> they died some time ago</u>
<u n="603" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="604" who="S0083">his his brother er died I think  I think  I'm sure he said he died well quite a while ago in the early two thousands I think</u>

<u n="606" who="S0083">erm I can't remember exactly <pause dur="short"/> erm so he's got like nieces and nephews and me and basically that's it <pause dur="short"/> so I mean I think before they had reason to come over and and visit family</u>

<u n="613" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="614" who="S0083">and I'm pretty sure that's what he was referring to you know he the bands on these big cruises I think he used to do that for a while <pause dur="short"/> erm so I think there was a lot of that and I don't know maybe he just enjoyed it there</u>

And she said her mum obviously is a bit of a cow bag just said categorically before she'd even got the words out no there's no way I'm lending you any money which is really charming <pause dur="short"/> but to get into the country you need to have five thousand Australian dollars in your bank account to prove that you can sustain yourself <pause dur="short"/> and they haven't just plucked this number out the year that's how much you need</u>
<u n="851" who="S0083">yeah</u>

<u n="859" who="S0083">no</u>
<u n="860" who="S0084">it's not really very fair that they fund your trip</u>
<u n="861" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I mean if they're wealthy then that's another matter but most you know ordinary people are</u>
<u n="862" who="S0084" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> you're generally just surviving aren't you?</u>
<u n="863" who="S0083">yeah pretty much</u>

<u n="1030" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0084">all the crap that you accumulate <pause dur="short"/> so that's good so I've been having a sort out</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0083" trans="overlap">so and where is it then?</u>
<u n="1033" who="S0084">it's the <anon type="place"/> it's the other building</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0083">really?</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0084">yup so over time what everyone's speculating is that they'll move us all over over there</u>
<u n="1036" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1037" who="S0084">and sell our building <pause dur="short"/> which is a nice building sort of the brown brick</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0084">building and sell it on to the property developers <pause dur="short"/> because all of that that's now flats was <anon type="place"/> land and bit by bit they've sold it off and it's it's basically been keeping the <anon type="place"/> afloat</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0083">selling things off?</u>
<u n="1041" who="S0084">selling things off <pause dur="short"/> so but the thing is you've only got one access road</u>
<u n="1042" who="S0083">well what happens when they when they've er ran out of things to sell?</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0084">well I think that's when the redundancies come</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0083">so what what have they done to the printing er?</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0084">well this where we are now</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I know they sold it off but but I mean</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0084">yeah they've sold the <unclear/></u>
<u n="1048" who="S0083" trans="overlap">they're not offices are they?</u>
<u n="1049" who="S0084">no they're it was a hangar</u>
<u n="1050" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1051" who="S0084">so they've brought in a company to put in a low ceiling and better flooring</u>
<u n="1052" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1053" who="S0084">and lights and all the rest of it <pause dur="short"/> the reported cost is two million pounds now I don't know if that's true</u>
<u n="1054" who="S0083">well why would <trunc>th</trunc> why bother why not just sell that bit off and leave you where you were?</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0084">well there's er there's more  there's more  space to move everybody into that building rather than move everybody from there into ours and ours is older</u>
<u n="1056" who="S0083">oh I see okay</u>
<u n="1057" who="S0084">and so they've moved us all into that but I think ELT's grown erm at an unsustainable rate</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0084">very quickly where we actually now er are no more than two hundred and then education they downsized and they had redundancies and they offshore all of their page makeup and all of their costs and they're turning a a really good budget now they're they're making quite a a healthy profit <pause dur="short"/> eLT is not making a profit this is the first year that I've been there that we won't get a bonus</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0083">oh</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0084">we won't meet budget this year which is really worrying</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0084">it's mainly and mainly because we sell <pause dur="short"/> I mean the education team don't sell internationally in the same that we do our markets our international markets <pause dur="short"/> and because of what's happening to the global market at the moment that's affecting our sales</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0084">so our <anon type="place"/> office closed recently you know the Arab Spring probably</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0083">right</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0084">didn't help the <anon type="place"/> office closed <pause dur="short"/> the <anon type="place"/> office closed</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0084">erm yeah I don't know what's gonna happen? I mean if if you have two hundred people <pause dur="short"/> basically we don't have enough people to publish the number of products that we have so they're hiring but at the same time we've got too many people <pause dur="short"/> so I think they're really gonna have to look at</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0083">oh it's strange isn't it?</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0084">what we can actually manage to publish and that was the whole thing behind this new restructure in the ELT</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0083">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0084">even though I've been there two years and we've had three restructures <pause dur="short"/> hopefully this is it for the restructure but they've decided that they're not gonna publish more products than we already have they're just going to look at respeccing what we already have in theory <pause dur="short"/> which should be less work but boost sales and look at obviously digitising everything that we have</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0084">but I don't know</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0083">oh dear</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0084">but we have a hell of a lot of work on at the moment just and that our digital capacity just isn't isn't there</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1079" who="S0084">you know that we've had to put on hold two of our global learning courses so creating something that's completely online</u>
<u n="1080" who="S0083">mm mm</u>
<u n="1081" who="S0084">and no books <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="1082" who="S0083">wow</u>
<u n="1083" who="S0084">which American institutions and <anon type="place"/> institutions love</u>
<u n="1084" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0084">they want to be completely paperless <pause dur="short"/> fine <pause dur="short"/> erm but I don't think we have the functionality and the capability there because it's just we've had to put them on hold and it's embarrassing</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1087" who="S0084">I don't know I think the Press is <unclear/></u>
<u n="1088" who="S0083">well I suppose you've got to decide if that's definitely the way you you've got to go</u>
<u n="1089" who="S0084">well certainly that's if that's what the markets are telling you they want that's what you have to do you have to respond</u>
<u n="1090" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1091" who="S0084">so I don't know I mean it's in terms of what we have at the moment I don't think our jobs are in danger because we have too much work <pause dur="short"/> but there's certainly our department isn't gonna hire to the point where <trunc>s</trunc> one of the lads in my department is doing maternity cover and what normally <trunc>ha</trunc> what's happened in the last two instances is they've given the person doing maternity cover a permanent job</u>
<u n="1092" who="S0083">mm</u>

<u n="1275" who="S0084">well if dad has got a pizza that'd be find by me but I don't think he's probably cooking what he cooks every time I go around which is chicken potato and veg <pause dur="short"/> which is fine because I never have</u>
<u n="1276" who="S0083">no and you like that yeah</u>
<u n="1277" who="S0084">meat in the house so <pause dur="short"/> well I'd rather he didn't cook the potato <pause dur="short"/> well I'd rather he mashes old potatoes if I was to put in a request but it's fine <pause dur="short"/> it's him cooking not me so</u>
<u n="1278" who="S0083">well you could always like peel potatoes when you get there and sort of so that when he comes in it's that's ready and you know?</u>
<u n="1279" who="S0084">yeah I could do <pause dur="short"/> I could do <pause dur="short"/> I mean I I just let him do what he's thinking of doing</u>
<u n="1280" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1281" who="S0084">because if you start messing with the the way he does things he doesn't like it <pause dur="short"/> no he doesn't like he doesn't know what's happening <pause dur="short"/> he's got a very straight idea of what's gonna happen</u>
<u n="1282" who="S0083">oh dear</u>
<u n="1283" who="S0084">I don't want to mess with that cos it might confuse the poor boy</u>
<u n="1284" who="S0083">you see I think that's I think he has taken a retrograde step</u>
<u n="1285" who="S0084">well no just that he <trunc>rea</trunc> his reactions all a lot slower when we were driving to wherever we went on the walk</u>
<u n="1286" who="S0083">I don't  I don't  mean in age I mean because he hasn't had me to nag him to to to think in a different way you know?</u>
<u n="1287" who="S0084">well possibly <pause dur="short"/> I mean but I don't think that's a problem to him and it's</u>
<u n="1288" who="S0083">no</u>
<u n="1289" who="S0084">certainly not a problem for a <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>I mean</u>
<u n="1290" who="S0083">no it's not</u>
<u n="1291" who="S0084">they <pause dur="short"/> but in in a way he's doing things that he would never have done before</u>

<u n="1293" who="S0084">which is fine <pause dur="short"/> I mean obviously the things he does now are things that you suggested that he do rambling</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0084">volunteering <pause dur="short"/> but they're things that he enjoys so fine</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0083" trans="overlap">well if if he enjoys it that's absolutely fine</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> I mean certainly he gets involved to quite a degree</u>
<u n="1298" who="S0083">yeah he does yeah</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0084">you know he's he's treasurer and <trunc>s</trunc> something else and</u>

<u n="1304" who="S0083">no it is it's very good</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0084">and meets people <pause dur="short"/> but yeah certainly when he was driving I noticed that his reactions are quite slow but then that's probably only because I'm I drive now and I compare his driving to my driving <pause dur="short"/> and he's I've always thought he was a very safe driver which he is</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> well as you get older your reactions do slow down</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> but probably you know just sort of hypersensitive to it because</u>
<u n="1308" who="S0083">mm you're you're</u>

<u n="1340" who="S0083">she</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0084">particular effort to see each other</u>
<u n="1342" who="S0083">you see he she doesn't</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0084">if he doesn't</u>
<u n="1344" who="S0083">she doesn't feel <trunc>sh</trunc></u>
<u n="1345" who="S0084">then she's obviously she doesn't need to either</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0083">she doesn't feel that she should have to make the first move and I I tend to agree</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0084">well that's fine</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0083">but that is after all how he is <pause dur="short"/> I mean I'm but <trunc>th</trunc> you know he shouldn't be like that but he is</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0083">and I I I <trunc>f</trunc> feel that I was wrong to say to you a long time a long long time ago when you were having all kinds of problems with him that's just how he is you have to accept it and I think you</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0084">I remember that conversation</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0083">and I think you  did <pause dur="short"/> and you've always</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0084">but I think I was always more <unclear/> him</u>

<u n="1355" who="S0084">yeah but that's because I'm selfish and like I I</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0083">it's not a selfish thing</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0084"><unclear/> on him because I that's what I need from him</u>
<u n="1358" who="S0083">yeah but that's</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0084">so I make him do that</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0083" trans="overlap">no but but there's <trunc>no</trunc></u>
<u n="1361" who="S0084" trans="overlap">I don't know whether that's because he should be doing that</u>
<u n="1362" who="S0083" trans="overlap">but that's a perfectly natural thing for you need that</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0083">it's not a selfish thing it's perfectly natural and you prompt him and he then responds because he will he won't do it himself but he will respond</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but then he doesn't</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0083" trans="overlap">and if she did the same he would respond to her but she doesn't see why she should have to</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0084">agreed <pause dur="short"/> I</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0083">that's the difference between you two</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0084">I agree but the more you do it the more he it enters his head to do it with you</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah I know</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0084">then because he thinks right I should call Michael and he might not do it but he</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0084">the feel the thought is there which is probably what it is with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> I should call her and I should arrange to see her</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0084">but he doesn't actually follow through all of the time and he will call</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0083" trans="overlap">he does  he does  phone her sometimes not very often but he does do it</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0084">and he'll call me and say oh are you gonna come around for</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0084">dinner this week or whatever?</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0084">which is nice and he'll call me at the weekend</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0084">erm but I don't know whether that's because you know I do go around and see him which <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> doesn't and the thought is already in his mind</u>
<u n="1384" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0084">because I have done in the past <pause dur="short"/> whereas if <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> just <pause dur="short"/> you know when I was living here I would go I would cycle over and see him</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1387" who="S0084">you know spend the night there on a Friday night or whatever</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0084">she doesn't do that</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0083">no</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0084">and fine that's their that's up to them</u>
<u n="1392" who="S0083" trans="overlap">but then she doesn't you see she she's <pause dur="short"/> but also don't forget she doesn't know if <trunc>sh</trunc> if he wants her to do that she this is what she feels</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0084">is that  is that  true?</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0083" trans="overlap">no she feels <pause dur="short"/> that is absolutely true she doesn't know</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0084" trans="overlap">what the <pause dur="short"/> the thing is with dad the the thing that I've always the reason I've always been able to get over the fact that he can't communicate through words is because I've always been assured of how I feel just through his actions <pause dur="short"/> obviously I I feel it's true when I say actions speak louder than words and I think he shows his affection through the things that he does for us <pause dur="short"/> but that I also can see that he doesn't necessarily pick up the phone when he should and</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0084">suggest things when he should <pause dur="short"/> but generally speaking</u>
<u n="1398" who="S0083">you make allowances</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0084">it goes above and beyond what I think is required but I can't I would never question how he feels about any of us and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> does</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I don't think she questions it I think she  I think she  just questions what she should do and why and what she feels he wants from her erm</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0084">that's so funny</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0083">mm there's just a different way of looking at things</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0084">yeah I would have never have thought that I didn't realise</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0083" trans="overlap">no she does <pause dur="short"/> because he's the parent</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0084">well yes yes</u>
<u n="1406" who="S0083" trans="overlap">it should be up to him you know? I mean I do  I do  feel that</u>
<u n="1407" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah absolutely he should drive the <trunc>r</trunc> the relationship ultimately</u>
<u n="1408" who="S0083">yes but he's not  he's not  a good driver</u>
<u n="1409" who="S0084">but then I think you know it was easier when they were living together because obviously they were there and</u>
<u n="1410" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1411" who="S0084">now that they're not living together <pause dur="short"/> I mean I think maybe he made more of an effort when she was at uni because she wasn't in the same city</u>
<u n="1412" who="S0083">yes</u>
<u n="1413" who="S0084">so I think he thinks oh she's here</u>
<u n="1414" who="S0083">that's right</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0084">now why wouldn't she come and see me?</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0084">so he's not</u>
<u n="1418" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1419" who="S0084">being the one saying well come over because he thinks oh she must be really busy <pause dur="short"/> when in actual fact she's just here every night waiting for him to pick up the phone <pause dur="short"/> so they're probably both guilty of</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0084">not making the effort that they should but as to who should start it</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0083">exactly</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0084">who can say? I mean yeah there's an argument that it should be dad</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0083">mm</u>
<u n="1425" who="S0084">I would say it should be dad but I suppose my relationship with him is is different</u>
<u n="1426" who="S0083">it is different</u>
<u n="1427" who="S0084">because I</u>
<u n="1428" who="S0083">and you are a different character to her so</u>
<u n="1429" who="S0084">yeah but she's</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0083">the way you respond to him is different to the way she does</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0084">that's probably because I'm a bull in a china shop when I just charge in there and she's more of a retiring violet or whatever the phrase is</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0083" trans="overlap">yeah but that's you know you you you get results through doing that</u>
<u n="1433" who="S0084">yeah but you also annoy everybody because ultimately</u>
<u n="1434" who="S0083">no I don't think so</u>
<u n="1435" who="S0084">you just you're you're not as <pause dur="short"/> even though you try to be thoughtful and considerate you</u>
<u n="1436" who="S0083">you are</u>
<u n="1437" who="S0084">you try <pause dur="short"/> but yeah but I do feel like you sort of you put yourself out there and you put yourself first and that's all I need</u>
<u n="1438" who="S0083" trans="overlap">that's it's always a risk <pause dur="short"/> it's not  it's not  putting yourself first you're you're just putting yourself out there and that is always a risk but I think it I still think you're right to do it <pause dur="short"/> erm and I can understand her reluctance to do that as well so</u>
<u n="1439" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1440" who="S0083">erm but don't beat yourself up for for any of this</u>
<u n="1441" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> well no I just accept that that's  that that's  my character and that's hers <pause dur="short"/> but I did find it strange that she hadn't even mentioned it to him but then you know if he's he's not very <unclear/> I mean they were meeting for lunch and things like that weren't they you know occasionally? They'd meet in town or spend a day together</u>
<u n="1442" who="S0083" trans="overlap">very occasionally <pause dur="short"/> I think that was before she even started work erm</u>
<u n="1443" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="1444" who="S0083">I mean <trunc>sh</trunc> because I mean like like</u>
<u n="1445" who="S0084">that's the thing she is quite tired</u>
<u n="1446" who="S0083">like it used to you all went over for Sunday lunch there</u>
<u n="1447" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1448" who="S0083">so she did that and then  and then  you see what happened was that he came over and he's done that a couple of times <pause dur="short"/> you know he will come over with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> when she's here to spend time with her</u>
<u n="1449" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="1450" who="S0083">but I find that difficult</u>
<u n="1451" who="S0084">yeah of course</u>
<u n="1452" who="S0083">so because you know he'll be here for two or three hours and I think oh God just go home</u>
<u n="1453" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1454" who="S0083">erm and that's fine so they get to see each other and that's good but you know it's</u>
<u n="1455" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1456" who="S0083">a bit more awkward for me</u>
<u n="1457" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1458" who="S0083">and I'm not gonna make a big song and dance about it but you know</u>
<u n="1459" who="S0084">well but the thing is she should know that do you know what I mean? Like she should think it's not fair on you</u>
<u n="1460" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I know but she's also she's you know she's tired and</u>
<u n="1461" who="S0084">this is her home</u>
<u n="1462" who="S0083">yeah it is her home</u>
<u n="1463" who="S0084">but</u>
<u n="1464" who="S0083">and when when she's not working I mean she does just kind of sleep and read and that's it</u>
<u n="1465" who="S0084">yeah but you know that's that's not really an excuse</u>
<u n="1466" who="S0083" trans="overlap">I mean I might suggest  I might suggest</u>
<u n="1467" who="S0084">yeah but you shouldn't have to suggest</u>
<u n="1468" who="S0083">no you see she's working  she's working  Saturday but I don't think she's working Sunday <pause dur="short"/> I might suggest she goes over and has lunch with him on Sunday</u>
<u n="1469" who="S0084">I think they should just spend the day or some time just the two of them or if <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s there then fine</u>
<u n="1470" who="S0083">mm <pause dur="short"/> I might</u>
<u n="1471" who="S0084">but they never do that</u>
<u n="1472" who="S0083">I might I might  prompt her to do that because she doesn't do it enough really and I might  I might  prompt her to go over on Sunday maybe because I don't think she's working</u>
<u n="1473" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> but she isn't that sort of person she isn't the sort of person to say what are you up to I'll come over?</u>
<u n="1474" who="S0083">no she's not</u>
<u n="1475" who="S0084" trans="overlap">she would always wait for the invitation whereas I'm not like that at all</u>
<u n="1476" who="S0083">no</u>
<u n="1477" who="S0084">because I think oh I'd quite like to pop down to <anon type="place"/> and see <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I would just say right how do you <trunc>f</trunc> how how are you fixed next weekend I thought I'd come down? And I would expect other people to be the same</u>
<u n="1478" who="S0083">yeah</u>
<u n="1479" who="S0084">but I suppose it's more polite to wait for an invitation but then in some instances when either either if it's family or if it's close friends</u>
<u n="1480" who="S0083">well no but they they</u>
<u n="1481" who="S0084">they're not gonna judge you if they want to see you</u>
