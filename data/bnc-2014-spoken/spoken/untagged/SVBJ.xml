<u n="221" who="S0018">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="222" who="S0093">and it's so I find it wrong because the X Factor for example I know  I know  I've met a lot of musicians <pause dur="short"/> I know a lot of musicians who have worked and slaved away and done all this sort of stuff <pause dur="short"/> and then X Factor it's it seems to be able yes you've got the overnight success for some people</u>
<u n="223" who="S0018">mm</u>

<u n="226" who="S0093">but there's a lot of there there it seems to encourage the fact that all you have to do is get up and sing a song in tune</u>

<u n="234" who="S0093">songs albums you know and actually creating fans</u>
<u n="235" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="236" who="S0093">through your own voice <pause dur="short"/> literally going you your your own voice but also what you want what you have to say has been heavily dissipated I think <pause dur="short"/> we've always had those girl <trunc>ban</trunc> boy bands <pause dur="short"/> back to the Bay City Rollers and whatever else</u>
<u n="237" who="S0018">mm mm</u>

<u n="489" who="S0093">now that you know opens up questions of why why were they faked? A if the <pause dur="short"/> the surface of the moon apparently goes from in the shade it goes er er out of the sun it's minus a hundred and twenty degrees</u>
<u n="490" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="491" who="S0093">it's something incredible <pause dur="short"/> to in the sun cos there's no atmosphere at er plus a hundred and twenty degrees <pause dur="short"/> man cannot survive on that</u>

<u n="507" who="S0093">yeah and they all came out brilliantly <pause dur="short"/> but there are er there are  there are  <trunc>n</trunc> a lot of anomalies within them <pause dur="short"/> but also <trunc>Hassel</trunc> I think it's Hasselblad have never used in all their publicity</u>
<u n="508" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="509" who="S0093">in all the marketing and any anything they put out to the public you know share erm share issues or whatever it is they don't mention the moon</u>
<u n="510" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="511" who="S0093">which is just the most astonishing thing <pause dur="short"/> if you  if you  had been the</u>
<u n="512" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="513" who="S0093">I think Kodak had a bit of that as well <pause dur="short"/> they didn't really push it <pause dur="short"/> who supplied the film itself</u>
<u n="514" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="515" who="S0093">you know Hasselblad <pause dur="short"/> I think it was Hasselblad supplied the cameras <pause dur="short"/> so why on earth?</u>
<u n="516" who="S0018">well on the moon?</u>
<u n="517" who="S0093">yeah</u>
<u n="518" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Why on the moon?</u>
<u n="519" who="S0093">we were the  we were the  we took the pictures on the moon</u>

<u n="527" who="S0093">they don't go overboard with it which you just think you'd be shouting from the roof tops then</u>
<u n="528" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="529" who="S0093">so er and the the anomalies the the whistle blowing which is supposed to have happened is fascinating to me <pause dur="short"/> er and that's where I really started believing that it was something else going on <pause dur="short"/> so anyway coming back to what I was saying erm <pause dur="short"/> why were they faked? If they were faked photographs</u>
<u n="530" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="531" who="S0093">which most <trunc>ex</trunc> a lot of experts say they are faked <pause dur="short"/> some of them are faked <pause dur="short"/> erm why were they? You know if <trunc>th</trunc> if they just went to the moon and they the cameras didn't work <pause dur="short"/> the film melted or snapped or whatever</u>
<u n="532" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="533" who="S0093">you know just that's tough <pause dur="short"/> and then try and lie about it and pretend that they were</u>
<u n="534" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="535" who="S0093">so you know they might have landed on the moon but they faked the photographs</u>
<u n="536" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="537" who="S0093">but I do believe they didn't do any of that</u>
<u n="538" who="S0018">was there moving film footage as well?</u>
<u n="539" who="S0093">yes of later <pause dur="short"/> well there was a camera attached to erm</u>
<u n="540" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="541" who="S0093">the side of the er or the <trunc>moon</trunc> er of the landing buggy</u>
<u n="542" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="543" who="S0093">er landing craft <pause dur="short"/> er but that could you know <unclear/> it could you could shoot any of that in a studio</u>
<u n="544" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="545" who="S0093">there's no question about that <pause dur="short"/> erm and there was so many in the within the photographs there's one famous one where there's a if you can imagine cross hatch</u>
<u n="546" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="547" who="S0093">where you get the cross on on a lens</u>
<u n="548" who="S0018">mm mm</u>
<u n="549" who="S0093">and in those days for some reason they're not on the moon landing shots had that <pause dur="short"/> and of course the lens is right there at the front of the  front of the  picture <pause dur="short"/> er sorry the hatch is at the <trunc>fr</trunc> front of the big cross hatch <pause dur="short"/> and yet there's one particular picture where there's a flag in the background something in the background <pause dur="short"/> and yet the cross goes behind the object</u>
<u n="550" who="S0018">ah <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="551" who="S0093">that's supposedly two hundred yards in front <pause dur="short"/> so you can't <pause dur="short"/> it can't be <pause dur="short"/> and that's thought to have been er somebody who has just sort of placed a</u>
<u n="552" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="553" who="S0093">little cos</u>
<u n="554" who="S0018">wasn't there something random in a something very strange in a reflection of the helmet visor or something?</u>

<u n="564" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> right</u>
<u n="565" who="S0093">and also shadows as well don't make sense <pause dur="short"/> there's a shadow going <pause dur="short"/> you know one sun you get one shadow in a direct straight line <pause dur="short"/> and yet on some pictures there's shadows at different angles <pause dur="short"/> and er and it's it all points to <pause dur="short"/> and I love this</u>
