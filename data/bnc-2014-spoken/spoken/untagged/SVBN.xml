<u n="139" who="S0144">so the real reason maybe that's what they're saying but the real reason is to make people aware that that's what they're doing <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> to get them</u>
<u n="140" who="S0024" trans="overlap">do you reckon that they're allowed in other places?</u>

<u n="143" who="S0144">there you go</u>
<u n="144" who="S0024">why isn't the angel lit up <pause dur="short"/> with the fairy lights?</u>
