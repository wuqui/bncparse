<u n="109" who="S0115" trans="overlap">ah but it's it's from the comedian's irony isn't it? Comedian comedians <trunc>i</trunc> you know if you're a popular comedian you can just talk as much crap as you want and people will just say oh he's being ironic or whatever</u>
<u n="110" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah but <pause dur="short"/> I suppose</u>
<u n="111" who="S0115">uh it's a bit like Ricky Gervais doing  Ricky Gervais doing  bad jokes</u>

<u n="119" who="S0115">there there is an element of like maybe overratedness maybe going on there but uh he's popular so</u>
<u n="120" who="S0037">he's stupid</u>
<u n="121" who="S0115">yeah you can  you can  make you know you you can achieve a lot by uh by kind of not being that talented I think or</u>
<u n="122" who="S0037" trans="overlap">nah <pause dur="short"/> I really don't think he is <pause dur="short"/> I mean I can see like why people like the um The Office and stuff <pause dur="short"/> I can understand why they like it</u>
<u n="123" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah but there's there's also Extras isn't there?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0037">and Extras yeah that is quite funny <pause dur="short"/> but I think I saw that what's it called? What was that about? <trunc>Sci</trunc> was it about science? Like he did a stand-up thing</u>
<u n="125" who="S0115">oh yeah he's terrible as a stand-up isn't he? That's his worst thing that's his worst skill</u>
<u n="126" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it was just like <pause dur="short"/> it was just so painful to watch</u>
<u n="127" who="S0115">he's very popular though but just can't stand</u>
<u n="128" who="S0037" trans="overlap">oh excuse me <pause dur="short"/> I didn't find anything funny about it at all like</u>
<u n="129" who="S0115">yeah Science was pretty bad actually but his stand-up is really bad and</u>
<u n="130" who="S0037">but why do people go and see it like?</u>
<u n="131" who="S0115">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> he's he's on Twitter isn't he uh?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0037">is he I haven't <pause dur="short"/> I dunno if I've got him</u>
<u n="133" who="S0115" trans="overlap">but I don't think you'd find it very funny yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0037">well I don't</u>
<u n="135" who="S0115">I think there's like loads of like random like world leaders and stuff like like Mahmood Ahmedinejad is on Twitter or something</u>
<u n="136" who="S0037">is he? Is it him though or is it a spoof one cos the spoof ones are my favourite</u>
<u n="137" who="S0115">well I probably think he he has  he has  like a  like a  main official one maybe</u>
<u n="138" who="S0037" trans="overlap">there's like a <pause dur="short"/> well I know I've got like President Obama on Twitter but it's obviously not him it's like</u>
<u n="139" who="S0115" trans="overlap">is there  is there  like Steven Hawking?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0037">uh I don't know</u>
<u n="141" who="S0115">oh yeah like the official one <pause dur="short"/> I I imagine that he he has one you know run by  you know run by  his his government runs uh like an official government <unclear/> tweet</u>
<u n="142" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I've got like um Arnold Schwarzenegger just cos I thought it was funny</u>
<u n="143" who="S0115" trans="overlap">like Kim Jong Kim Il  Kim Il  Sung</u>
<u n="144" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but then <trunc>ma</trunc> <trunc>ma</trunc> my favourite thing is like the ones where you get like um a spoof one <pause dur="short"/> so like you know when Harry Redknapp was involved in all of that scandal and then there was all the like um what was I gonna say all of that uh or whether he's gonna get the England job and stuff <pause dur="short"/> and he obviously he speaks with a like a really strong sort of East End accent doesn't he?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0115">oh yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0037">and like there was loads of like  loads of like  you having a laugh?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0115" trans="overlap">oh yeah it's good yeah yeah yeah</u>

<u n="150" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0115">um so it might be <trunc>he</trunc> like um and on Facebook it might be actually hard to tell whether it's a real celebrity or if it's a spoof I mean</u>
<u n="152" who="S0037">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="153" who="S0115">I think it would be fair that everybody should have the right to their own uh name you know to their own</u>
<u n="154" who="S0037">well you can get it validated I think</u>
<u n="155" who="S0115" trans="overlap">but of course some people have</u>
<u n="156" who="S0037">on Twitter like you can get it like um you can write like accredited like Stephen Fry's one is like got like a little badge <pause dur="short"/> the ones that are like they've got like a little badge in the corner to show that it really is them</u>
<u n="157" who="S0115">oh yeah I see</u>
<u n="158" who="S0037">so you can get it like especially if you</u>
<u n="159" who="S0115">the best thing I saw about Twitter is you um</u>

<u n="176" who="S0037"><unclear/></u>
<u n="177" who="S0115">yeah what d'you think about celebrities? D'you think it's moral or like a bit dodgy to have like prying cameras in celebrities' lives and everybody getting <trunc>in</trunc> really interested about things that have gone wrong with celebrities you know or d'you think that's a bit like unethical maybe?</u>
<u n="178" who="S0037">I think like it <trunc>dep</trunc> I well I don't think anyone should be like spying on people</u>

<u n="269" who="S0115">um in the direction of like perhaps of removing the need to um to to kill animals for uh for food like by growing the muscle tissue</u>

<u n="278" who="S0037" trans="overlap">although I sort of don't really like her when she was going on about like whinging about having to pay tax it's like oh poor you <pause dur="short"/> you and your ten million pounds <pause dur="short"/> probably ten billion pounds</u>
<u n="279" who="S0115" trans="overlap">metres cubed <pause dur="short"/> I don't know what do they get like fifty or forty-five or forty percent tax or something um</u>
<u n="280" who="S0037">well they've just changed it haven't they recently but yeah but it was fifty <trunc>perc</trunc></u>
<u n="281" who="S0115" trans="overlap">they've slightly <trunc>low</trunc> they've <trunc>s</trunc> they've done something to lower it slightly for wealthy people</u>
<u n="282" who="S0037">but it was fifty percent tax</u>
<u n="283" who="S0115">um</u>
<u n="284" who="S0037">but if you're gonna make like ten million pounds then it's five million pounds is much the same ten million pounds I imagine</u>
<u n="285" who="S0115">ah well I don't know I mean <pause dur="short"/> I think it it does go <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's not  it's not  great to to have to take that much of someone's money but uh</u>
<u n="286" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah but I think  I think  it doesn't matter</u>
<u n="287" who="S0115" trans="overlap">you you probably would be benefitting from you know from the tax in certain ways but uh</u>
<u n="288" who="S0037">yeah but I mean</u>
<u n="289" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah I mean ideally the the there <trunc>sh</trunc> there should be more I think that the the government should make more of a profit by itself without having to tax people although that sounds nice on paper but I don't know the extent that uh we would be taking about state capitalism <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so I don't know what they it's like</u>
<u n="290" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I don't have a problem with taxing people who've got millions of pounds half of it</u>
<u n="291" who="S0115">uh well yeah it's it's controversial isn't it because obviously they're gonna  they're gonna  say well I uh I've got if I earn um a million pounds a year and you're taking half of that that then</u>
<u n="292" who="S0037">yeah but that's more than enough to live on</u>
<u n="293" who="S0115" trans="overlap">they they would feel they're not  they're not  getting as much back as like as other people are I suppose <pause dur="short"/> I mean it is controversial but I guess they of course they're free to leave though they're free to leave the country and if they don't  if they don't  approve of it then they uh</u>
<u n="294" who="S0037" trans="overlap">does it not work <pause dur="short"/> does it not work that like you get taxed normally up to a certain rate and then whatever you earn over that you get half of?</u>
<u n="295" who="S0115">um I'm not I don't know much that much about it</u>
<u n="296" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it is man <pause dur="short"/> like so I remember like if if you're earning under something you don't get taxed <pause dur="short"/> if you're earning like the majority of the population earning between I think</u>
<u n="297" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well <trunc>the</trunc> they have different rates d'you mean different rates for different income?</u>
<u n="298" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="299" who="S0115">yeah <pause dur="short"/> the progressive taxation increases <pause dur="short"/> the percentage increases as you get more yeah</u>
<u n="300" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah so like <pause dur="short"/> most people are taxed whatever it is twenty-five percent or twenty percent or I can't even remember</u>
<u n="301" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean the problem is it's like  it's like  a big system isn't it the the government and you know the people are sort of a bit confused sometimes as to where the money's going and how efficiently it's being used</u>
<u n="302" who="S0037" trans="overlap">thirty percent <pause dur="short"/> yeah but a <trunc>hun</trunc> but for most people like a hundred thousand pounds a year is more than enough to live on</u>
<u n="303" who="S0115">I've heard comments coming from your direction that you you believe that you pay uh rather a large amount of tax</u>
<u n="304" who="S0037">I do <pause dur="short"/> I hate it</u>
<u n="305" who="S0115" trans="overlap">and you you only pay like uh you know the the sort of the more the lower rate isn't about twenty-five for you I guess</u>
<u n="306" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I know it's annoying <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it is and I hate it I hate seeing like I've got like eight hundred pounds out of me</u>
<u n="307" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> so if <trunc>s</trunc> if you can see their point of view you're like obviously you're only paying twenty-five but Adele you know poor old Sean Connery is is paying like you know fifty percent on his  on his  uh income and stuff but uh</u>
<u n="308" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah I can <pause dur="short"/> I can but <pause dur="short"/> yeah but that's probably <trunc>en</trunc> like but it's probably enough to live on isn't it?</u>
<u n="309" who="S0115">I think some people just don't seem to mind and others really hate it they think tax is theft so</u>
<u n="310" who="S0037">but</u>
<u n="311" who="S0115">that's what you hear from the you know sort of you know sort of centre right or libertarian type of people</u>
<u n="312" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but you know I was a student for a long time and I've got grandparents who get pensions and stuff so I suppose we've just got to live with it everyone</u>
<u n="313" who="S0115" trans="overlap">all the the sort of the the main strategy of government is to sort of keep things more or less the same unless unless you have to change something um <pause dur="short"/> you generally keep don't mess with something you know if it ain't broke don't fix it sort of thing but</u>
<u n="314" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="315" who="S0115">they wouldn't make too many changes but they do they have made some changes they have lowered slightly the like some they have lowered tax for wealthy people <pause dur="short"/> uh that's that's that's sort of the the the uh the the the doctrine that uh you know that um</u>
<u n="316" who="S0037" trans="overlap">that's just Tories isn't it? It's just their  it's just their  like</u>
<u n="317" who="S0115">yeah the like the sort of uh of the  of the of the  economic liberal people who who would obviously they believe that if you lower tax then you encourage uh global business and that view is espoused by you know like the Economist magazine</u>
<u n="318" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it's unsurprising that they should do that</u>
<u n="319" who="S0115">so the latest magazine uh the Economist's front cover that I saw was um</u>
<u n="320" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="321" who="S0115">uh Cameron's budget for global uh for what was it? Cameron's budget for <trunc>bus</trunc> you know global business or something like that</u>
<u n="322" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="323" who="S0115">and there was a picture of like basically complimenting and</u>
<u n="324" who="S0037" trans="overlap">his big yeah</u>
<u n="325" who="S0115">actually it was actually Osborne and you know <trunc>com</trunc> complimenting Osborne and Cameron and sort of <trunc>ma</trunc> mocking the Vince Cable um but uh they the the suggestion on the cover was that uh Osborne and Cameron were welcoming foreign investment basically into the country using the incentive of lower tax but <trunc>obv</trunc> but obviously it's not <trunc>a</trunc> it's not just about tax is it I mean that's <pause dur="short"/> it's it's in fact <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="326" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well of course I mean <pause dur="short"/> I I'm not <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> but I'm not suggesting that I've got a like a massive global standpoint on it all I'm saying is like in my opinion we should tax them because</u>
<u n="327" who="S0115">the best thing  the best thing  with this is</u>
<u n="328" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I was trying to say ten million pounds is as much as saying five million pounds like</u>
<u n="329" who="S0115">well that's clearly not the same is it?</u>
<u n="330" who="S0037">no but if you're just a person like the salary that I get</u>
<u n="331" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well that is a hundred million pounds the same as fifty million um well does it? Is it are you doing like a  like a  linear relationship?</u>
<u n="332" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well yes <pause dur="short"/> in terms of what you need <pause dur="short"/> no but like it's just extra stuff isn't it after that <trunc>l</trunc> really? You need a house to live in <pause dur="short"/> you need some food <pause dur="short"/> You know like it's just <trunc>ec</trunc> it does <trunc>all</trunc> they don't need ten million pounds for that you need like I dunno</u>
<u n="333" who="S0115" trans="overlap">oh yeah no I mean I kind of see I kind of know what I kind of see that point of view uh but obviously if you're an investor that you know they these guys like <pause dur="short"/> the there's a lot of there are a lot of injustices in the world that's for sure but I mean <pause dur="short"/> I mean there's a lot of</u>
<u n="334" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0115">the problem with <pause dur="short"/> there's a lot of problems with money I mean cos like if you you know you can get money from from not doing anything so I mean that was the whole like if you're talking like the sort of Marxist idea which was to sort of you you want to connect uh money with with labour</u>
<u n="336" who="S0037">mhm</u>
<u n="337" who="S0115">uh so therefore I suppose that uh that that that a Marxist view would criticise uh having you know the <trunc>a</trunc> the ability to sort of invest money and then to receive money back</u>
<u n="338" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="339" who="S0115">uh for an individual without actually doing any labour</u>
<u n="340" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="341" who="S0115">um but the reality is that the individuals and investors do tend to <pause dur="short"/> they will choose lower tax over high tax a lot of them <pause dur="short"/> but it's more complicated though because</u>
<u n="342" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well I mean</u>
<u n="343" who="S0115">it's a bit like uh you know if you wanna <pause dur="short"/> britain and America that the so-called Anglo-Saxon system was to be more liberal and like lower the tax and like um allow the <trunc>f</trunc> the free business whereas European models who are like Germany and France would do uh more supposedly more like statey</u>
<u n="344" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="345" who="S0115">and more like regulatory <pause dur="short"/> and I think a another example is the banking um regulations cos there was a big fight over this there was a big bust-up within the EU in between you know it was when Cameron vetoed it and um</u>
<u n="346" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0115">and then for example you know Mr Wetherspoon put like pro-Cameron like in stuff in in Wetherspoon's <pause dur="short"/> so Mr Wetherspoon is an example of these types of people who want like <pause dur="short"/> he's not called Mr Wetherspoon he's called  he's called  Tim he's called Tim Martin and uh and he is an example of the sort of person who wants the Anglo-Saxon model and they want lower tax you know lower they want less red tape they want less state interference</u>
<u n="348" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I know he's not <pause dur="short"/> I like I liked his name</u>
<u n="349" who="S0115">I mean he's it's not a coincidence that he's that his pubs are based on George Orwell's idea of a good pub and you know he he will have read George Orwell presumably because he dislikes state interference</u>
<u n="350" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but one of the best things <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> one of the best policies that I read though is about like in Norway I think it's Norway one of the Scandinavian countries where like it's they set it so that it's not possible for people at the top to earn</u>
<u n="351" who="S0115">yeah this is the redistributive redistributative <pause dur="short"/> um <vocal desc="laugh"/> redistributional uh model</u>
<u n="352" who="S0037">okay well it's not</u>
