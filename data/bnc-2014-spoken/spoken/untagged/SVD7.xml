<u n="16" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> a little music not so much <pause dur="short"/> actually the</u>
<u n="17" who="S0179">adverts</u>

<u n="40" who="S0020">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0179">it was fantastic last weekend so we spent erm about four or five hours driving up and then down to and from Sunderland <pause dur="short"/> and it er sort of</u>
<u n="42" who="S0020">covered your petrol?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0179">erm more than yes</u>
<u n="44" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0179">it actually leaves you in profit</u>
<u n="46" who="S0020">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0058">well I suppose you can go out for a meal and stick the recorder on the table and</u>
<u n="48" who="S0020" trans="overlap">does it have to be grown-ups?</u>
<u n="49" who="S0058">yes <pause dur="short"/> ideally yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0020">okay <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="51" who="S0058">erm because it's from a permission's point of view like</u>
<u n="52" who="S0020" trans="overlap">sorry?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0058">from a permission's point of view <unclear/></u>
<u n="54" who="S0179" trans="overlap">well no because that's in so for example <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s children he could give permission for them?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0058">no but erm it's slightly you know we have to have a different consent form and sort of so it is easier <unclear/> and that's alright</u>
<u n="56" who="S0020">okay</u>
<u n="57" who="S0058">erm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0179">but is it possible?</u>
<u n="59" who="S0058">not really <pause dur="short"/> we've said no for this project <pause dur="short"/> it is  it is  possible but</u>
<u n="60" who="S0179">oh</u>
<u n="61" who="S0058">we've said no for this project</u>
<u n="62" who="S0020"><unclear/></u>
<u n="63" who="S0058">because it makes even more <pause dur="short"/> it makes it more difficult from a permissions perspective because you know every person who speaks has to sign a consent form to say that they give their consent for the <trunc>recor</trunc> the <unclear/></u>
<u n="64" who="S0020" trans="overlap">okay so</u>
<u n="65" who="S0058">erm so</u>
<u n="66" who="S0020">so you need for me to sign a consent form?</u>
<u n="67" who="S0058" trans="overlap"><trunc>F</trunc> <trunc>f</trunc> for this yeah if that's alright? But it's not a complicated one <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but you know</u>
<u n="68" who="S0020">right</u>
<u n="69" who="S0058"><unclear/> Erm but yeah just because we can't record people without them knowing or without them giving their consent it's just you know really complicated</u>
<u n="70" who="S0020">even though the data is <pause dur="short"/> well I mean apart from the person recording the data</u>
<u n="71" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="72" who="S0020">it's completely anonymous isn't it?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0058">yes <pause dur="short"/> erm but we erm you you're just not allowed to record people without them knowing and also it's useful to have things like people <pause dur="short"/> erm so the form asks to give your first language which is useful</u>
<u n="74" who="S0020">okay</u>
<u n="75" who="S0058">to store</u>
<u n="76" who="S0179"><unclear/> erm you are erm well I think when you're filming something in a public location you're gonna capture <unclear/> images</u>

<u n="215" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I mean we did them for a bit so you know we're we're all <unclear/> with cleaning the entire household</u>
<u n="216" who="S0179">well the way I look at it is it would take us twice as long</u>
<u n="217" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="218" who="S0179">to do it half as well</u>
<u n="219" who="S0020">yeah</u>
<u n="220" who="S0058">she spends an hour and she gets the place spotless</u>
<u n="221" who="S0179" trans="overlap">and that's the entire place</u>
<u n="222" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="223" who="S0179">and for nine pounds</u>
<u n="224" who="S0020">it sounds like you've got a good cleaner?</u>
<u n="225" who="S0058">she's very good yeah <unclear/> But yeah it could take us twice that and it wouldn't be as good so we'll</u>
<u n="226" who="S0020" trans="overlap">we'll have an agency in erm so every now and again you change cleaners <unclear/></u>
<u n="227" who="S0058">oh right</u>
<u n="228" who="S0020">and so when you've got a good one you're lucky <unclear/></u>
<u n="229" who="S0179">well we've got the daughter of our neighbour's which is quite useful</u>
<u n="230" who="S0058">yes</u>
<u n="231" who="S0179">because <unclear/> accountability</u>
<u n="232" who="S0020">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="233" who="S0058">that's why we thought it would be a good idea just</u>
<u n="234" who="S0020">well there</u>
<u n="235" who="S0058">rather than have some random person you know like a bit like an agency and it's just that extra level of <unclear/></u>
<u n="236" who="S0020" trans="overlap">yes although there's also so my parents-in-law had a cleaner for the same cleaner for like twenty years or something and so they there was a relationship there</u>
<u n="237" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="238" who="S0020">but as a consequence they didn't  they didn't  feel able they were able to push things like <unclear/> to use real polish and not Mr Sheen</u>
<u n="239" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="240" who="S0020">on the  on the  grandfather antique grandfather clock or <unclear/></u>
<u n="241" who="S0058">yes</u>
<u n="242" who="S0179">well on the other hand I I mean that relationship sort of has to be sort of built on foundations as in</u>
<u n="243" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="244" who="S0179">early on if you're sort of open about what you expect</u>
<u n="245" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="246" who="S0020" trans="overlap">I think that's right I think early on you only have to say look you are not using Mr Sheen on the antique grandfather clock you're using real polish</u>
<u n="247" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="248" who="S0020">and if you don't we won't pay you</u>

<u n="252" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it all depends <pause dur="short"/> I mean erm ours was very kind of if you don't want like anything done you know the way I do it everyone likes it different just say <pause dur="short"/> please tell me don't just you know worry about saying things <pause dur="short"/> she was really kind of keen that we'd say if we like it done differently but it was all it was fine and we didn't need to say a thing and she was very <unclear/></u>
<u n="253" who="S0020">I think my parents-in-law are a bit erm <unclear/> when it comes to things like that as well <pause dur="short"/> they carried on employing her erm and she she gradually got older and older older and had to retire and they carried on employing her for some time after she was actually proving useful</u>
<u n="254" who="S0058">yes</u>
<u n="255" who="S0020">you know but er I think it was more her eyes she wasn't really able to spot the dirty bits</u>
<u n="256" who="S0058">oh that's sad yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> in all fairness though I mean your mam's had the same cleaner for how many years?</u>
<u n="257" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="258" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and she's great and they get on like a house on fire</u>
<u n="259" who="S0179">yeah and she's got a erm it actually works very well because I mean she's got a erm a er a fairly young son he's probably about I don't know ten now erm who erm used to come and sort of sit and <unclear/> and such a nice well-mannered little boy <pause dur="short"/> erm and so I've erm we we recently got rid of some er DVDs some Harry Potter DVDs because we've now got the <unclear/></u>
<u n="260" who="S0020">oh yeah</u>
<u n="261" who="S0179">erm and and erm so I've returned them back to my mother to give to a charity shop and er she suggested that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> might like <unclear/> And er <unclear/> and then at the weekend we got a lovely thank you card from him</u>
<u n="262" who="S0020">oh yeah</u>
<u n="263" who="S0058">it was really sweet yeah</u>
<u n="264" who="S0179">erm but it also works very well because erm both er her son and herself get on very well with our dog and when my mum started to work she used to work sort of eighty percent of the time erm a lot at home <pause dur="short"/> and when she started to work full-time more of it out of home she erm it was very useful to have someone to come in and walk the dog at lunchtime</u>
<u n="265" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="266" who="S0179">which she would do and she'd sort of take that as her erm her lunch break so to speak <pause dur="short"/> so it got to a very useful arrangement at the end</u>
<u n="267" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="268" who="S0020">oh by the way how long is this project going on for?</u>
<u n="269" who="S0058">this one? Erm</u>

<u n="272" who="S0058"><unclear/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="273" who="S0179">which <unclear/> if you need to pay tax on it or <unclear/></u>
<u n="274" who="S0020">well there is that as well</u>
<u n="275" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="276" who="S0179">shh</u>
<u n="277" who="S0020">I know <unclear/></u>
<u n="278" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="279" who="S0058">oh dear <pause dur="short"/> erm yes er well it it's going on until erm the beginning of April</u>
<u n="280" who="S0020">okay</u>
<u n="281" who="S0058">but but kind of for this phase <pause dur="short"/> and there might be erm kind of some more after that</u>
<u n="282" who="S0020">right</u>
<u n="283" who="S0058">but we don't know yet</u>
<u n="284" who="S0020">okay</u>
<u n="285" who="S0058">erm so yeah until the beginning of April</u>
<u n="286" who="S0179">but this is quite meta or at least this is being studied disrupting what is studied because</u>
<u n="287" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="288" who="S0179">quite a lot of the conversation is about recordings and about recording <pause dur="short"/> so the word <unclear/> will come up disproportionately <unclear/></u>
<u n="289" who="S0058">it it doesn't actually because most people <pause dur="short"/> like I've listened back to the beginning <unclear/> and most people don't use that word they just say it's gonna be used for books it's used for research</u>
<u n="290" who="S0179" trans="overlap">right <unclear/> research books</u>
<u n="291" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="292" who="S0179">but those will still be disproportionately represented</u>
<u n="293" who="S0058">yes in a way <pause dur="short"/> in a way</u>
<u n="294" who="S0179">er but I tend to talk more about statistics so</u>
<u n="295" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="296" who="S0020">well yes I mean you you're not trying to do sampling of people who you're recording are you?</u>
<u n="297" who="S0058">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="298" who="S0020">so you know?</u>
<u n="299" who="S0179">I think those are words which really occurred to me <unclear/></u>
<u n="300" who="S0058">hmm</u>
<u n="301" who="S0179">I still think you should have employed a statistician</u>
<u n="302" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="303" who="S0020">you know the fact that it's presumably friends and family of employees?</u>
<u n="304" who="S0058">erm not only we we did also just advertise</u>
<u n="305" who="S0020">okay</u>
<u n="306" who="S0058">for people to <unclear/> So yeah but it's it kind of erm yeah some of it is friends and family of employees some of it's erm you know just random as in their friends and family</u>
<u n="307" who="S0179">and again there's a boundary layer of both sort of intelligence or sort of literacy and wealth because not only do you have to be literate but you need to be able to afford a recorder</u>
<u n="308" who="S0020">afford a recorder?</u>
<u n="309" who="S0058">well the the freelancers have to erm pay for their own or have one already a recorder <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="310" who="S0020">so you're gonna make me pay for a recorder?</u>
<u n="311" who="S0058">do you have anything that will record?</u>
<u n="312" who="S0179">your phone will probably probably would</u>
<u n="313" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> er er oh yeah this is <unclear/> do you  do you  have anything that will record like audio files?</u>
<u n="314" who="S0020">no I don't</u>
<u n="315" who="S0058">no</u>
<u n="316" who="S0020">probably the phone will</u>
<u n="317" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="318" who="S0020">er</u>
<u n="319" who="S0058">what? Have you got er?</u>
<u n="320" who="S0020">how much are those recorders?</u>
<u n="321" who="S0058">you can pay anything between about twenty thirty up to about two hundred and fifty</u>

<u n="335" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="336" who="S0179">what you should do is just strike up a conversation with some people <unclear/> the train or like <unclear/></u>
<u n="337" who="S0058">May be yeah</u>
<u n="338" who="S0179">you would have to get them to sign so people are going to be a bit suspicious</u>
<u n="339" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="340" who="S0179">I should think <unclear/> go into a pub like okay I'll buy you a drink if you'll talk to me for an hour</u>
