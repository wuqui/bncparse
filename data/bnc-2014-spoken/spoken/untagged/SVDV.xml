<u n="1" who="S0392">yeah so it's a rainy day for them isn't it?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0480">it is indeed a rainy day for <anon type="place"/> horse racing limited</u>
<u n="3" who="S0392">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah there must be some sort of horse event going on down here as well today</u>
<u n="4" who="S0480">well there there always is around here</u>
<u n="5" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was reading this book about erm where money comes from you know? so like how there's more money in the circulating around and it said</u>
<u n="6" who="S0480">oh yeah</u>
<u n="7" who="S0392">if you go and get a mortgage from a bank or something or take a loan out what it's doing is it's not getting that money off someone else it just puts the money in your account from nowhere and what it does is it makes sure that for every pound someone puts into their account it keeps say five percent of that or even as low as one or two percent of that and then it can give off anything else as well <pause dur="short"/> so it <unclear>seemed</unclear> quite strange</u>
<u n="8" who="S0480" trans="overlap">so the money isn't transferred?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0392">no</u>
<u n="10" who="S0480">so is that almost creating money?</u>
<u n="11" who="S0392">yeah it is that's how money is created by commercial banks and there's all these models and everything it's really complicated I couldn't really understand it but there's a pyramid where the base of the pyramid is money people have put into their account</u>
<u n="12" who="S0480">yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0392">and the top of the pyramid is money that the banks have created and supposedly the Bank of England can control the amount of money that the banks create by either raising or making smaller the base amount but apparently that's realistically they can't do that</u>
<u n="14" who="S0480" trans="overlap"><trunc>b</trunc>by altering the base rate?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0392">yeah by <trunc>al</trunc>altering the percentage that's on the bottom of the pyramid</u>
<u n="16" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but that sort of links in with what you're saying about the the building societies even selling on this debt</u>
<u n="18" who="S0480">yeah that that's <pause dur="short"/> flabbergasting really I just</u>
<u n="19" who="S0392" trans="overlap">quite a lot goes on yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0480">it <pause dur="short"/> it always seems to me that that whole <pause dur="short"/> the whole industry that whole financial services industry sort of feeds off itself</u>
<u n="21" who="S0392">yes yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0480">it's like somebody who's eating as much as they possibly can</u>
<u n="23" who="S0392"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="24" who="S0480">in order to eat their own flesh to stay alive</u>
<u n="25" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0480">and get bigger</u>
<u n="27" who="S0392"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="28" who="S0480">if they're eating their own flesh <pause dur="short"/> how come they're getting bigger? are they really getting bigger? or are they not getting bigger?</u>
<u n="29" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah yeah well when we were in erm the stockbroker belt as you say</u>
<u n="30" who="S0480">oh yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0392">we went to <anon type="place"/> in <anon type="place"/> which is this private square you'd like it was just normal street but it's owned by Mitsubishi Corporation funnily enough and er</u>
<u n="32" who="S0480" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="33" who="S0392">and it's where the stock exchange is based now and there's this man stood on the door this bouncer really checking everybody before they go in to make sure there's no one unauthorised going in or anything</u>
<u n="34" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0392">so if anyone me or you tried to get in he'd have you out straight away <pause dur="short"/> so there must be something going on that they don't want us to see</u>
<u n="36" who="S0480"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="37" who="S0392">if he's they're employing someone to stand there</u>
<u n="38" who="S0480" trans="overlap">so that's the actual stock exchanges <unclear/> is it? so</u>
<u n="39" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah so only it's not on Thread Needle Street anymore they moved to behind Saint Paul's Cathedral</u>
<u n="40" who="S0480">yeah I've heard of <anon type="place"/> of <anon type="place"/> <unclear/> is it <unclear/>? that'll be an unusual word that's uh</u>
<u n="41" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0480">that's not often used these days</u>

<u n="50" who="S0480">uh do you know? I don't <trunc>kno</trunc> I think I think they do refrigerate it but <pause dur="short"/> I've an idea they do general trucking as well though</u>
<u n="51" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I presume that the polar bear logo was because everything was just freezing yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0480" trans="overlap">oh yeah that might be a giveaway but I don't</u>
<u n="53" who="S0392">but not all of them might we must be near <anon type="place"/> Morrisons then here cos they always <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="54" who="S0480" trans="overlap">well it's just up there just on your erm yeah just up on your left</u>
<u n="55" who="S0392">there's some people who work for Morrisons who live eh well not work for Morrisons sort of own Morrisons or are related to the people who own it live not far from us a couple of miles and there was security in <anon type="place"/> because one of their birthday parties they had some <pause dur="short"/> like Adele or someone singing</u>
<u n="56" who="S0480">oh</u>
<u n="57" who="S0392">apparently it cost them two hundred and fifty thousand pound for half an hour I don't know how true that is</u>
<u n="58" who="S0480" trans="overlap">er it wouldn't surprise me</u>
<u n="59" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0480">it wouldn't surprise me at all</u>
<u n="61" who="S0392" trans="overlap">when you compare that to what we're getting for today</u>
<u n="62" who="S0480">uh it's strange isn't it? erm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="64" who="S0480">who was? <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>kn</trunc> I know that there there are a few of the Morrison clan scattered about</u>
<u n="65" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0480">erm <anon type="place"/> and er <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="67" who="S0392">that's it <anon type="place"/> that's where it was yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0480" trans="overlap"><anon type="place"/> yeah yeah we looked at a job there once</u>

<u n="73" who="S0392" trans="overlap"><anon type="place"/> is it?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0480"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="75" who="S0392">yeah</u>

<u n="77" who="S0392">Gary? Gary <trunc>bar</trunc></u>

<u n="82" who="S0480">I think so I <trunc>do</trunc> I <trunc>do</trunc> I don't know the ins and outs of the whole</u>
<u n="83" who="S0392" trans="overlap">because <pause dur="short"/> there's all sorts of rumours about people who live round here well not rumours I think they're they're probably quite true about people who've made their money from that oh I'm sure I've heard selling the land from the <anon type="place"/> from somewhere before as well</u>
<u n="84" who="S0480">might might well be there's erm around this area between <pause dur="short"/> you know from <anon type="place"/> northwards going up towards I suppose I suppose up towards <anon type="place"/> and up that way there's a scattering of people <pause dur="short"/> certainly erm all the Morrison's money is up here</u>
<u n="85" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0480" trans="overlap">and all the <anon type="place"/> money is up here or a lot of it is up here <pause dur="short"/> and erm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's just it's just mind-boggling the the sheer the sheer volume of it and the difference</u>
<u n="87" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0480">you know? you're not talking about somebody who <pause dur="short"/> has made a million which isn't that unusual these days</u>

<u n="90" who="S0480">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm or somebody who's inherited a million or won a million on the on the er lottery or the pools or whatever erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>I</trunc>it's multiples of that</u>
<u n="91" who="S0392">yeah</u>

<u n="94" who="S0480">same as you or I might spend a tenner</u>
<u n="95" who="S0392">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you're right I think someone said that there's more millionaires in than anyone else in the country any other region</u>
<u n="96" who="S0480">really?</u>
<u n="97" who="S0392">yeah I don't <vocal desc="laugh"/> I think it's one of those little factoids that you hear about I don't know how true it is but <pause dur="short"/> it's certainly believable isn't it?</u>
<u n="98" who="S0480">well knowing yeah yeah it it it could be I <trunc>do</trunc> I mean I'd have thought London was far more than <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>

<u n="110" who="S0480" trans="overlap">maybe that dilutes it</u>
<u n="111" who="S0392">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but no I that was what I would have thought <pause dur="short"/> yorkshire's a big county though isn't it?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yes yes it is</u>

<u n="120" who="S0480" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="121" who="S0392">strictly speaking is its own thing now</u>

<u n="124" who="S0480">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0392">but erm nowadays a lot of those towns have their own individual borough councils their own sort of erm <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>au</trunc>authorities unitary authorities</u>
<u n="126" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0392">I mean I was when I was doing the work experience at <anon type="place"/> a lot of them were talking about devolution erm which is <pause dur="short"/> they were saying what's going to happen to the future of the county whether it's going to be split up divided up cos <anon type="place"/> especially is erm not knowing where to go cos it's included in the <anon type="place"/> city region plan because</u>
<u n="128" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0392">the <anon type="place"/> and surrounding area which included some people have said that north yorkshire should be split up into <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> should go it alone or even just <anon type="place"/> by itself it's all it's all to do with this northern powerhouse as well and they all want their own eh</u>
<u n="130" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah?</u>

<u n="132" who="S0480">yes <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="133" who="S0392">they'll then return a mayor that's favourable to whoever's in government in the day yeah</u>

<u n="147" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="148" who="S0480">so Scotland wants independence</u>

<u n="239" who="S0392">is that strange as far as villages go?</u>
<u n="240" who="S0480" trans="overlap"><unclear/> I'd have thought a little <pause dur="short"/> cos it's it's about <pause dur="short"/> it's a similar size to <anon type="place"/> where we have the bow</u>
<u n="241" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="242" who="S0480">and that has a little village shop</u>

<u n="244" who="S0480">why is that I wonder?</u>
<u n="245" who="S0392">they've all they've the mentality is definitely wouldn't want to be in in the village it would be drive out to <anon type="place"/> that's not a problem for them and also it it's unlike anywhere else we've always thought that there there's the characters you get there the people there and everything</u>
<u n="246" who="S0480">yeah</u>
<u n="247" who="S0392">erm it's very much a village of two halves soon as you pass the pub it's in into the east end</u>
<u n="248" who="S0480" trans="overlap">I wonder why</u>
<u n="249" who="S0392">definitely the people in the west end where we er you know other way round rather the people in the east end where we are would definitely say that you'd rather live there than in in the other side</u>
<u n="250" who="S0480">so is the other side is the side nearer the <anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="251" who="S0392">yes yeah</u>
<u n="252" who="S0480" trans="overlap">between the pub and the <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="253" who="S0392">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="254" who="S0480">right</u>
<u n="255" who="S0392">I mean there's no difference at all really but they think they're a cut above where we are and with it being long and not sort of spread out as wide it's quite linear</u>
<u n="256" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="257" who="S0392">that creates quite an introverted almost not wanting to</u>
<u n="258" who="S0480" trans="overlap">yeah it's funny isn't it? yeah</u>
<u n="259" who="S0392">go out which is why a shop maybe or a community thing wouldn't be the best thing only the a few of us from the village go to the domino drives whereas all the other three villages draw a a big local following</u>
<u n="260" who="S0480">do they?</u>
<u n="261" who="S0392">yeah especially <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> they all get plenty of locals whereas <anon type="place"/> there's only me uncle <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and the person who runs it</u>
<u n="262" who="S0480"><vocal desc="laugh"/> so it's a bit of a funny place then isn't it? how <pause dur="short"/> this <trunc>f</trunc> linear villages are really strange aren't they?</u>
<u n="263" who="S0392">yeah</u>
<u n="264" who="S0480" trans="overlap"><anon type="place"/>'s like that it's like two houses wide</u>

<u n="267" who="S0392">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos <anon type="place"/> and <anon type="place"/> they're both not so linear they sort of spread outwards and I think it makes people feel like they're more in it together if you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="268" who="S0480">if it's more compact</u>
<u n="269" who="S0392" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's never really been a lot going on in <anon type="place"/> really</u>
<u n="270" who="S0480">no <pause dur="short"/> good scarecrows at the minute</u>
