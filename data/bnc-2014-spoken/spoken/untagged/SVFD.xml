<u n="258" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="259" who="S0411">you that you should be not should be but it's more normal for most humans and he fully understands that some people like to be with one person for their whole life and that's fantastic but he thinks that you go through so many phases in your life that it's very very difficult for one person to weather those phases with you</u>
