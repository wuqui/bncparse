<u n="6" who="S0253">have you seen or read the first one?</u>
<u n="7" who="S0250">I've seen the first one</u>
<u n="8" who="S0253">so at the beginning it's like it's the idea that <pause dur="short"/> there was a great uprising</u>
<u n="9" who="S0250">yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0253">erm which was then stomped upon by the man</u>
<u n="11" who="S0250">yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0253">and they do the <trunc>hung</trunc> for like the idea is that like <pause dur="short"/> the people in the districts the poor people in the districts <pause dur="short"/> like you know they sort of convince them that the uprisings were wrong and you know and and everyone agrees that they were wrong</u>
<u n="13" who="S0250">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0253">and the <trunc>hung</trunc> and the hunger games is a celebration of them quashing the rebellious elements of society when in fact it was society itself is you know</u>
<u n="15" who="S0250">it's a bit stupid</u>
<u n="16" who="S0253">yeah so they all live out in the</u>
<u n="17" who="S0250" trans="overlap">and it's and this er er going back going back to Battle Royale and like at least then with that one it was just kind of like</u>

<u n="22" who="S0253">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah Battle Royale is a great idea</u>
<u n="23" who="S0250">apparently er when the Suzanne is it Suzanne Collins or something like that</u>
<u n="24" who="S0253" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0250">who wrote this the very <trunc>sh</trunc> when she wrote it she was like I never heard of it and then you know <trunc>wh</trunc> once it had pretty much got to print someone was like aye or it was like someone in the er like the publishers was just like <pause dur="short"/> this is exactly the same as Battle Royale <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="26" who="S0253">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0250">like</u>
<u n="28" who="S0253">dystopian</u>
<u n="29" who="S0250">yeah</u>

<u n="33" who="S0250">and like and so they just told her to go through carry on with it</u>
<u n="34" who="S0253">and it's been a big hit hasn't it <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="35" who="S0250">but <pause dur="short"/> I don't know just like I suppose like she'd done her own thing for it it's just</u>
<u n="36" who="S0253" trans="overlap">well it's it's written for a different audience</u>
<u n="37" who="S0250">yeah</u>
<u n="38" who="S0253">western western writers have been stealing Japanese culture for years anyway</u>
<u n="39" who="S0250">yeah</u>
<u n="40" who="S0253" trans="overlap">and passing it off as other things like horror and <trunc>s</trunc> you know</u>
