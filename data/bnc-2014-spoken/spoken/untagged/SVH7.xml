<u n="1" who="S0058"><pause dur="long"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> that's better</u>
<u n="2" who="S0179">what's better?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0058">some food</u>
<u n="4" who="S0179">oh good</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="5" who="S0058">I bet you anything my dad'll have that sandwich when we get there</u>
<u n="6" who="S0179">sorry?</u>
<u n="7" who="S0058">I bet you anything my dad'll have that sandwich when we get there</u>
<u n="8" who="S0179">why would he have that sandwich?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0058">well <pause dur="short"/> as in I assume we're not gonna use it</u>
<u n="10" who="S0179">eat it tomorrow as a snack</u>
<u n="11" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> fair enough <pause dur="short"/> if we want it he won't eat it</u>
<u n="12" who="S0179">why would he eat it?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0058">I really imagine him being like oo <pause dur="short"/> he's got something for well-travelled sandwiches</u>
<u n="14" who="S0179">why?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0058">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> when we used to do dancing shows you know he obviously used to take he had to take food for the whole day <pause dur="short"/> so loads of sandwiches basically <pause dur="short"/> and um</u>
<u n="16" who="S0179">the whole day?</u>
<u n="17" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> um so when when I used to do shows we used to um you went in the morning on the day of the show <pause dur="short"/> and you rehearsed all day <pause dur="short"/> and then did the show on the night <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> it was actually quite good preparation for a sort of professional thing <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> far more so than just going along on the evening <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="18" who="S0179">why?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0058">Cos that's more what their days are like <pause dur="short"/> but um</u>
<u n="20" who="S0179">so it's nothing like say in athletics where you don't wanna train before you</u>
<u n="21" who="S0058">well yeah</u>
<u n="22" who="S0179">compete</u>
<u n="23" who="S0058">I'm as I said it I was just thinking that <pause dur="short"/> like it seems like an odd thing to do <pause dur="short"/> but she <trunc>w</trunc> obviously found it worked <pause dur="short"/> but I mean</u>
<u n="24" who="S0179">perhaps she presumably got to charge for this?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0058">presumably got to?</u>
<u n="26" who="S0179">charge for the fact you were receiving instruction for all the way through the day</u>
<u n="27" who="S0058">no no</u>
<u n="28" who="S0179">oh</u>
<u n="29" who="S0058">um we were well <unclear/> we were er there was kind of the rehearsals up to that point had been so expensive that I think that the day of the show was sort of free <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="30" who="S0179">expensive? How much do dance lessons oh God cost per session?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember exactly <pause dur="short"/> I think when I left it was about six pounds an hour <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> which isn't bad</u>
<u n="32" who="S0179">how many in a class?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0058">it varied from upper <trunc>classe</trunc> upper level classes sort of it could be as few as sort of three or four <pause dur="short"/> lower level classes thirty <pause dur="short"/> and so for yeah for the show rehearsals you'd have to pay say for a fiver an hour for three hours a night four or five times a week <pause dur="short"/> and there'd be a hundred people there <pause dur="short"/> so that's not an insignificant amount of money <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Um and you had to buy all your costumes and and stuff <pause dur="short"/> so I think it was sort of taken as reasonable <pause dur="short"/> but like yeah I had to get a day off school every time I did a show</u>
<u n="34" who="S0179">really?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="36" who="S0179">how on <trunc>ear</trunc> you earth were you allowed to do that?</u>
<u n="37" who="S0058">I think it was argued to be a sort of enriching experience</u>
<u n="38" who="S0179">oh I figured it was only going to be a recreational activity</u>
<u n="39" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0179">you shouldn't be allowed time off school</u>
<u n="41" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="42" who="S0179">like if I'd been a head teacher I wouldn't have allowed that</u>
<u n="43" who="S0058">but I mean sort of er like obviously</u>
<u n="44" who="S0179">why should you be allowed to do that but the</u>
<u n="45" who="S0058">no I'm not  I'm not  saying</u>
<u n="46" who="S0179">parents not be allowed to take kids on holiday?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0058">I'm not saying that was right <pause dur="short"/> I mean  I mean  I guess it was one day rather than</u>
<u n="48" who="S0179">yeah but it's one day repeatedly over the year</u>
<u n="49" who="S0058">not that many a year <pause dur="short"/> a couple of times a year <pause dur="short"/> wasn't like these were every month</u>
<u n="50" who="S0179">okay <pause dur="short"/> so you er miss five days of school in two years versus one one week holiday in two years</u>
<u n="51" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> you're probably right <pause dur="short"/> in all fairness <trunc>paren</trunc> in all fairness parents can take their kids out of school for holidays if they want to</u>
<u n="52" who="S0179">oo there's an interesting legal grey area</u>
<u n="53" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean I think if they just keep er</u>
<u n="54" who="S0179">Cos they are legally obliged to provide <unclear/> for a full education or at least access to a full education <pause dur="short"/> I think you could be arguing that's breaching their duty of care <pause dur="short"/> the school can't legally stop them</u>
<u n="55" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0179">but social services probably could</u>
<u n="57" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think it would be a case of if you're doing it and it you know and it's not being it's not enough to be brought to the attention of anyone who has any power to do anything about it then <pause dur="short"/> whereas if it was every you know two weeks every term they'd probably say something <pause dur="short"/> but you can do it <pause dur="short"/> it's just the school doesn't like it <pause dur="long"/> Do you find at work that there's er that the office is a lot quieter during school holidays? mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0179">not really</u>
<u n="59" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0179">Cos most people's kids are still quite young</u>
<u n="61" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's interesting just</u>
<u n="62" who="S0179">but to be honest <unclear/> sort of four or five people are out of the office in the States or in Europe for <trunc>f</trunc></u>
<u n="63" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> fair enough <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's just interesting that yeah ours does get noticeably quieter <pause dur="short"/> like into er sort of half term and summer holidays and stuff</u>
<u n="64" who="S0179">it's a very different type of office</u>
<u n="65" who="S0058">it is <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> And probably a bigger variety of child ages</u>
<u n="66" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> and most of our office are men <pause dur="short"/> so my team excluded</u>
<u n="67" who="S0058">well <pause dur="short"/> my your yeah <pause dur="short"/> no but I mean</u>
<u n="68" who="S0179">obviously you have a massive <unclear/> majority of women <pause dur="short"/> and we have a massive</u>
<u n="69" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="70" who="S0179">majority of men</u>
<u n="71" who="S0058">I'm not sure it would make much difference though <pause dur="short"/> like I cos er</u>
<u n="72" who="S0179">of course it will because</u>
<u n="73" who="S0058">if you  if you  wanna go on holiday both of you would go</u>
<u n="74" who="S0179">yeah but there's holidays for mother</u>
<u n="75" who="S0058">from from a child-care perspective</u>
<u n="76" who="S0179">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="77" who="S0058">yeah from a childcare perspective the mother might do it I guess <pause dur="long"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> the moon's really weird tonight</u>
<u n="78" who="S0179">sorry?</u>
<u n="79" who="S0058">the moon's really weird <pause dur="short"/> it's one of those ones where you can see like the the shape of it but <pause dur="short"/> actually you can't see much now but earlier you could see the shape of the the moon but then just the the light bits</u>
<u n="80" who="S0179">well that's gonna be an M and S lorry there</u>
<u n="81" who="S0058">huh <pause dur="short"/> aw</u>
<u n="82" who="S0179">oh yeah wow that's low</u>
<u n="83" who="S0058">what the moon? Yeah it's funny isn't it?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0179">I thought is that a reflection?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="86" who="S0179">no that's actually just the moon</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="87" who="S0058">are you er you can understand all the kind of I like thinking about like in the past when they didn't know what the sun and the moon were and the stars <pause dur="short"/> and you know how would you  how would you  see them? What would you say they were? I just think it's interesting <pause dur="short"/> how do you explain the moon getting bigger and getting smaller again? You know <pause dur="short"/> eclipses and what are stars and these lights in the sky? Like that kind of thing <pause dur="short"/> so like in Old English um stars are sky-candles <pause dur="short"/> they're very keen on like compounds um sort of descriptive thing <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember what they're called <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so like um a swan-road is the sea <pause dur="short"/> and yeah like they're er no sorry the sun is a sky-candle <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I think it's a nice nice image</u>
<u n="88" who="S0179">surely swan-road would be a river not</u>
<u n="89" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0179">the sea?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0058">I dunno why they call it a swan-road <pause dur="short"/> it's got and whale-road as well which er makes a bit more sense</u>
<u n="92" who="S0179">hm</u>
<u n="93" who="S0058">they're quite keen on those things <pause dur="short"/> really interesting</u>
<u n="94" who="S0179">what's the Old English word for swan?</u>
<u n="95" who="S0058">probably swan <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I can't remember exactly <pause dur="short"/> wouldn't be surprised if it was swan</u>
<u n="96" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0058">and road's probably rad <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Or rod <pause dur="short"/> or roden or something</u>
<u n="98" who="S0179">hm</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="99" who="S0058">I was thinking the other thing I need to get while we're at <trunc>s</trunc> at my parents is my um my dissertation notes and stuff <pause dur="short"/> like um my hard notes</u>
<u n="100" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="101" who="S0058">um quite useful when I as I'm rewriting it</u>
<u n="102" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> sure</u>
<u n="103" who="S0058">I'm er hoping to dig them out <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure they're quite handy <pause dur="short"/> be on top of all the stuff <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="104" who="S0179">or they'll be hidden under something <pause dur="short"/> yes</u>
<u n="105" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> There's a few things to er dig out <pause dur="short"/> I'm trying to think what er what to watch first on iPlayer <pause dur="short"/> there hasn't been anything sort of revolutionary on</u>
<u n="106" who="S0179">if there's a Top Gear on I'd like to watch some of that <unclear/></u>
<u n="107" who="S0058">there's always Top Gear on to be honest</u>
<u n="108" who="S0179">yeah but any new Top Gear <unclear/></u>
<u n="109" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> true <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's always some on iPlayer but it's not necessarily new <pause dur="short"/> might be <pause dur="short"/> no er cos like things like Sherlock and you know really you wanna watch <pause dur="short"/> they're really good <pause dur="short"/> but there hasn't been anything at least nothing that I know of that's been that good <pause dur="short"/> I've been watching MasterChef at work though <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="110" who="S0179">masterChef?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0058">masterChef <pause dur="short"/> it's brilliant</u>
<u n="112" who="S0179">how is it brilliant?</u>
<u n="113" who="S0058">how is it brilliant?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="115" who="S0058">I dunno it's just really interesting and er kind of engaging in a weird way <pause dur="short"/> like so it starts off er they're the same every week <pause dur="short"/> it's really simple <pause dur="short"/> like they're er in this sort of big open kitchen thing <pause dur="short"/> and they all have a bench <pause dur="short"/> and there's some ingredients at the front of the room <pause dur="short"/> and they're told right you've got however many hours <pause dur="short"/> pick your ingredients and cook us something <pause dur="short"/> and it's just really fascinating to see what they come up with</u>
<u n="116" who="S0179">you see I like Ready Steady Cook cos it's quick and they don't know what they're gonna have to use</u>
<u n="117" who="S0058">yeah that is quite fun actually <pause dur="short"/> I do like Ready Steady Cook <pause dur="short"/> um thingy's annoying though <pause dur="short"/> what's his name?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0179">er</u>
<u n="119" who="S0058">Ainsley Harriott</u>
<u n="120" who="S0179">I like him <pause dur="short"/> I do like him</u>
<u n="121" who="S0058">he's always er yeah he's quite fun <pause dur="short"/> he's er he's um <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="122" who="S0179">does he ever have holiday?</u>
<u n="123" who="S0058">sorry?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0179">just wondering if he er he ever has a holiday</u>
<u n="125" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="126" who="S0179">actually maybe they film more than one episode a day</u>
<u n="127" who="S0058">probably yeah <pause dur="short"/> they probably did like a block of however many <pause dur="short"/> the same audience would watch <pause dur="short"/> cos they're quite short <pause dur="short"/> you know they're only half an hour programmes or something aren't they? Cos they do the twenty minute long one and then a sort of five minute challenge</u>
<u n="128" who="S0179">what?</u>
<u n="129" who="S0058">so Ready Steady Cook there was er maybe they've had to change the format halfway through or something <pause dur="short"/> but um so there'd be like it took it was twenty minutes wasn't it that you got to do the main</u>
<u n="130" who="S0179">I thought it was half an hour</u>
<u n="131" who="S0058">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> maybe it was <pause dur="short"/> yeah maybe there was some different ones where they did it twenty minutes and five minutes</u>
<u n="132" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think the whole length of the programme's forty forty-five minutes</u>
<u n="133" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> fair enough <pause dur="short"/> yeah so they could film a few of those in a day <pause dur="short"/> most stuff they do like um quiz shows and stuff they film a few in a  in a  go <pause dur="short"/> er but the the people just change their clothes <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="134" who="S0179">who changes their clothes?</u>
<u n="135" who="S0058">so like the presenter <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> so like Rob Brydon on Would I Lie to You? would just change his clothes</u>
<u n="136" who="S0179">ah right</u>
<u n="137" who="S0058">and you and you'd probably see um more there's er probably be more than one episode filmed with the same audience</u>
<u n="138" who="S0179">okay</u>
<u n="139" who="S0058">I think it probably depends on the show <pause dur="short"/> but so yeah I imagine</u>
<u n="140" who="S0179">I was gonna say Mock the Week they can't do that because it's topical</u>
<u n="141" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so like Have I Got News for You they couldn't do that <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but other stuff like QI they probably film a few in a go</u>
<u n="142" who="S0179">QI annoys me so much</u>
<u n="143" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="144" who="S0179">how is he thirty?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0058">what the one ahead?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0179">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0058">with cool lights</u>
<u n="148" who="S0179">do you not recognize those lights?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0058">I didn't but now you've said it I do</u>
<u n="150" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> it massively annoys me <pause dur="short"/> because Stephen Fry's smug face</u>
<u n="151" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="152" who="S0179">that man needs a beating</u>
<u n="153" who="S0058">I mean huh it's quite it's it's er it's I was just I was about to say it's quite interesting <pause dur="short"/> huh <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> it's alright <pause dur="short"/> it's I'm I don't enjoy it quite as much as I used to <pause dur="short"/> I think it's got a <trunc>b</trunc> a bit samey</u>
<u n="154" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> stephen Fry</u>
<u n="155" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="156" who="S0179">being smug <pause dur="short"/> as is the programme</u>
<u n="157" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean it was  it was  quite a fun format when it started <pause dur="short"/> but yeah they're quite a way into it now so actually it's not quite as much fun <pause dur="short"/> but yeah so MasterChef is now my quality slash rubbish somewhere in the middle TV of choice <pause dur="short"/> it's excellent</u>
<u n="158" who="S0179">did you see the thing about Rowan Atkinson? So you know that er Countryfile presenter filed a law suit against the BBC for age discrimination</u>
<u n="159" who="S0058">I was reading about this today <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="S0179">and that Rowan Atkinson wrote a letter to some news <trunc>r</trunc> radio chat</u>
<u n="161" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0179">show thing saying that this is disgusting and that it goes against artistic freedom</u>
<u n="163" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0179">it's like no</u>
<u n="165" who="S0058">not sure it does <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="166" who="S0179">because there's a difference between an employment contract and er</u>
<u n="167" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0179">she's not a performer <pause dur="short"/> she was a presenter <pause dur="short"/> there is a difference</u>
<u n="169" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0179">so she's not an actor <pause dur="short"/> she is someone whose job it is to <pause dur="short"/> that's a bit like cos er I'm trying to think  I'm trying to think  of a comparable example <pause dur="short"/> there's not many</u>
<u n="171" who="S0058">well in all fairness if he was told no you can't do any more films ever because you're too old he wouldn't like it <pause dur="short"/> he'd say that was discrimination</u>
<u n="172" who="S0179">er</u>
<u n="173" who="S0058">I think he's just getting a bit</u>
<u n="174" who="S0179">no I <trunc>d</trunc> I can see his point <pause dur="short"/> but then again</u>

<u n="176" who="S0179">this is someone who's done very well out of the industry</u>
<u n="177" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean I can't er I I think he's right in the sense</u>
<u n="178" who="S0179">but it's not really the same industry <pause dur="short"/> it's er  it's er  as in a camera's pointed at him it's for a completely different context <unclear/></u>
<u n="179" who="S0058">I I think he's worried about comedy being unable to say things that are offensive</u>
<u n="180" who="S0179">no that's not what he was</u>
<u n="181" who="S0058">but</u>
<u n="182" who="S0179">going on about</u>
<u n="183" who="S0058">well er the article I read was er it was was saying that it's  it's part  part of his campaign about you can't have comedy without the right to offend <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="184" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> but that has to be</u>
<u n="185" who="S0058">so</u>
<u n="186" who="S0179">in moderation <pause dur="short"/> and that's what it's always been</u>
<u n="187" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I I er yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0179">Rowan Atkinson is a bit of an interesting individual</u>
<u n="189" who="S0058">yeah er I</u>
<u n="190" who="S0179">this is a guy who totalled a McLaren F1 on dry clear roads</u>
<u n="191" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I <trunc>g</trunc> the more I know about him the more I'm getting the impression that he's a bit of an interesting character</u>
<u n="192" who="S0179">as in he's <trunc>cl</trunc> he's very close friends with Jeremy Clarkson</u>
<u n="193" who="S0058">and Prince Charles</u>
<u n="194" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="195" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Interesting er dinner parties he must have</u>
<u n="196" who="S0179">well hang on <pause dur="short"/> yeah and er er cos Jeremy Clarkson's very good friends with David Cameron</u>
<u n="197" who="S0058">is he?</u>
<u n="198" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="199" who="S0058">bullingdon?</u>
<u n="200" who="S0179">so</u>
<u n="201" who="S0058">or is <trunc>J</trunc> is Clarkson Oxford or not?</u>
<u n="202" who="S0179">no</u>
<u n="203" who="S0058">they're they're not Bullingdon are they? <vocal desc="laugh"/> I can just imagine them getting together and braying loudly about the plebs <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Actually Clarkson's not particularly brayey <pause dur="short"/> he's not posh <pause dur="short"/> he's just just Clarkson <pause dur="short"/> but yeah Rowan Atkinson <pause dur="short"/> I was er</u>
<u n="204" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> as I say</u>
<u n="205" who="S0058">A bit odd</u>
<u n="206" who="S0179">I don't understand how he managed to do er <pause dur="short"/> someone who owns a McLaren F1 firstly to own it is a bit of an interesting judgement <pause dur="short"/> the car costs a million quid new</u>
<u n="207" who="S0058">fff</u>
<u n="208" who="S0179">it costs about two million now <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> alright fair enough you're a keen driver but and have the money but I do get the er it's only got one seat</u>
<u n="209" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh right</u>
<u n="210" who="S0179">Cos er the idea is you sit in the centre <pause dur="short"/> it's like a racing car</u>
<u n="211" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> hence why it's called the F1 presumably</u>
<u n="212" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> um the idea was it was as close as possible to driving a road car a racing car on the road</u>
<u n="213" who="S0058">on the road <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="214" who="S0179">and <unclear/> symbol from the nineties <pause dur="short"/> and there is a certain amount of well yes but</u>
<u n="215" who="S0058">hm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="216" who="S0179">yeah I I do just <trunc>c</trunc> like before you drive that I'd have a lot of advanced driving lessons <pause dur="short"/> and I bet he didn't <pause dur="short"/> and again it'd be very easy to drive</u>
<u n="217" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="218" who="S0179">fast on a track <pause dur="short"/> it's very different from being able to drive on a public road</u>
<u n="219" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> maybe he'd had lots of Formula One style racing lessons <pause dur="short"/> hence figured it was the same</u>
<u n="220" who="S0179">but no I think he had it for years</u>
<u n="221" who="S0058">oh okay</u>
<u n="222" who="S0179">but again totalling a car like that that's quite an effort <pause dur="short"/> in the sense that although it's massively fast it's just got massively good brakes and very good steering</u>
<u n="223" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="224" who="S0179">traction</u>
<u n="225" who="S0058">so he'd really have to</u>
<u n="226" who="S0179">well no you'd have to be driving like a tit</u>
<u n="227" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="228" who="S0179">which wouldn't be difficult in a car like that</u>
<u n="229" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> more money than sense I guess</u>
<u n="230" who="S0179">sorry?</u>
<u n="231" who="S0058">more money than sense</u>
<u n="232" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="233" who="S0058">as in the people who can afford them really shouldn't be driving</u>
<u n="234" who="S0179">in a lot of cases <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="235" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I just</u>
<u n="236" who="S0179">Cos when you've got that money there's a very there's a certain lack of responsibility</u>
<u n="237" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> just buy another one <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="238" who="S0179">well you can't really <pause dur="short"/> they don't make them</u>
<u n="239" who="S0058">well er yeah maybe <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="240" who="S0179">I suspect they'll try and repair it <pause dur="short"/> but er</u>
<u n="241" who="S0058">but it's not it doesn't mean the same maybe <pause dur="short"/> and you don't need to worry too much about other people <pause dur="short"/> cos money <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="242" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> indeed <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and I think so that's a bit interesting <pause dur="short"/> but I felt that article was just really interesting because it was sort of <trunc>y</trunc> that's not she wasn't an artist <pause dur="short"/> she was a presenter</u>
<u n="243" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="244" who="S0179">that was her job <pause dur="short"/> and you</u>
<u n="245" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="246" who="S0179">and <trunc>emp</trunc> and that she was employed in a full-time contract and</u>
<u n="247" who="S0058">well yeah</u>
<u n="248" who="S0179">in that capacity you are entitled to legal protection against discrimination</u>
<u n="249" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="250" who="S0179">and er you <trunc>d</trunc></u>
<u n="251" who="S0058">and it's right that you are</u>
<u n="252" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="253" who="S0058">I think is the key point</u>
<u n="254" who="S0179">and her age didn't compromise her ability to relay information</u>
<u n="255" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="256" who="S0179">to the public</u>
<u n="257" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think that's the critical thing</u>
<u n="258" who="S0179">um it made her and it didn't necessarily make her you know it it's I mean do you select employee er er presenter on accounts they're attractive to look at? Um you could argue there's a part of that</u>
<u n="259" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="260" who="S0179">but then well I think there's a difference again between selecting someone from a job and getting rid of them</u>
<u n="261" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="262" who="S0179">from that job</u>
<u n="263" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> if you've selected them and you can't really go right now you're past your best <pause dur="short"/> you just it doesn't really work like that in you know <pause dur="short"/> like you said it's er it didn't compromise her</u>
<u n="264" who="S0179">well</u>
<u n="265" who="S0058">ability to to have people tune in and watch her and convey the information and you know</u>
<u n="266" who="S0179">and let's face it who the hell watches Countryfile for the totty?</u>
<u n="267" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Exactly <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah it was a stupid decision anyway whatever way you look at it</u>
<u n="268" who="S0179">but she did make an interesting point <pause dur="short"/> there are very few old women in television</u>
<u n="269" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's true <pause dur="short"/> it is true <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="270" who="S0179">there's lots of er elderly men <pause dur="short"/> and I think that is a you know I'm er as a rule I think that for sort of sex discrimination cases that are well not that's not a fair comment but as a I'm massively against any sort of positive discrimination</u>
<u n="271" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no no</u>
<u n="272" who="S0179">but on the other hand I think that's a situation that does perhaps need correcting <pause dur="short"/> as in  an in</u>
<u n="273" who="S0058">it needs correcting but not postively discriminated against <pause dur="short"/> but you</u>
<u n="274" who="S0179">no you <trunc>c</trunc></u>
<u n="275" who="S0058">people who are capable and have been in the job a long time shouldn't be sacked cos they've over fifty or sixty <pause dur="short"/> it's not  It's not  right</u>
<u n="276" who="S0179">no this is  this is  probably because she was over forty in all fairness but</u>
<u n="277" who="S0058">well <pause dur="short"/> er I don't I</u>
<u n="278" who="S0179">uh</u>
<u n="279" who="S0058">to be honest I don't know who it was <pause dur="short"/> I didn't recognize the name or seen her <pause dur="short"/> I've never seen Countryfile <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> There wasn't a picture in the article I read <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Um</u>

<u n="480" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> well and now he's joining an orchestra as well as a boat club and</u>
<u n="481" who="S0058">well I mean</u>
<u n="482" who="S0179">it's like for fuck's sake</u>
<u n="483" who="S0058">the thing is</u>
<u n="484" who="S0179">and a gym <pause dur="short"/> and a</u>
<u n="485" who="S0058">I mean the thing is I think they are things he wants to do <pause dur="short"/> I think he wants to be in an orchestra and and a boat club <pause dur="short"/> that's fine <pause dur="short"/> but you probably don't have time to do that and the EWB like er and er I don't think he wants to do EWB</u>
<u n="486" who="S0179">isn't it a bit creepy? Shouldn't he leave it to his undergraduates? The student <unclear/></u>
<u n="487" who="S0058">well he's he's he's got a  a he's  he's the professional network coordinator <pause dur="short"/> um yeah shall I um</u>

<u n="489" who="S0058">do you want number one?</u>
<u n="490" who="S0179">er yes please <pause dur="short"/> what's that job?</u>
<u n="491" who="S0058">um he he kind of er sends out information to the um the people who were interested as you know so kind of graduates who are interested if you like</u>
<u n="492" who="S0179">right <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="493" who="S0058">so er well no people who are in industry now</u>
<u n="494" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="495" who="S0058">working as engineers who still wanna be without borders <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="496" who="S0179">of course</u>
<u n="497" who="S0058">um do you wanna turn it on or shall I?</u>
<u n="498" who="S0179">mm <pause dur="short"/> er the thing that amuses me a little bit I dunno why <unclear/> is the the fact that they take themselves really seriously and act as if it's sort of Mé<trunc>de</trunc> Médecins Sans Frontières except they're not <pause dur="short"/> they don't do anything like that <pause dur="short"/> they piss about and</u>
<u n="499" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="500" who="S0179">generally again they spend a lot of time training</u>
<u n="501" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="502" who="S0179">for things that are never <trunc>g</trunc></u>
<u n="503" who="S0058">there seems to be a big focus on training and meetings and organization and hierarchy</u>
<u n="504" who="S0179">if they <trunc>s</trunc> if they spent a fraction of that time and energy earning extra got a part-time job earned some more money send that to a proper aid organization or let alone the government</u>
<u n="505" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="506" who="S0179">who actually do this sort of work properly</u>
<u n="507" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean</u>
<u n="508" who="S0179">Cos again the point about Médecins Médecins Sans Frontières is they go into very iffy situations</u>
<u n="509" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="510" who="S0179">so they they go before the WHO does <pause dur="short"/> they go into war zones</u>
<u n="511" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="512" who="S0179">they actually go they go in ahead of armed forces in some cases</u>
<u n="513" who="S0058">hence the Sans Frontières</u>
<u n="514" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> they really put themselves in a lot of danger</u>
<u n="515" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="516" who="S0179">engineers Without Borders don't <pause dur="short"/> they don't go into any er they don't do any</u>
<u n="517" who="S0058">no <pause dur="short"/> it's got an entirely different</u>
<u n="518" who="S0179">they don't do any  disaster relief work <pause dur="short"/> at least not in the immediate short-term</u>
<u n="519" who="S0058">not <trunc>imme</trunc> not short-term <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> they do</u>
<u n="520" who="S0179">they might go in six months later</u>
<u n="521" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean I think the point er the the their sort of their purpose is that you teach people what how to do it themselves <pause dur="short"/> and you also teach them how to get the information themselves so they can stay up to date <pause dur="short"/> so that you don't need to go back</u>
<u n="522" who="S0179">yes but the point being that <unclear/> actually it's very patronizing</u>
<u n="523" who="S0058" trans="overlap">but yeah you can pay er one person to do that</u>
<u n="524" who="S0179">no no <pause dur="short"/> it's incredibly patronizing to say there are no engineers in Cameroon</u>
<u n="525" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="526" who="S0179">of course there are engineers in Cameroon <pause dur="short"/> who will do a lot more work a lot more effectively for a lot less money <pause dur="short"/> I E for the same amount of money particularly by the time you've flown out there you get a shitload more down</u>
<u n="527" who="S0058">no well they pay yeah they pay for their own ticket so they could've donated that money</u>
<u n="528" who="S0179">exactly <pause dur="short"/> it is essentially charity tourism <pause dur="short"/> it's a whole <unclear/></u>
<u n="529" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean er er</u>
<u n="530" who="S0179">it's just by a slightly more high moral ground <pause dur="short"/> hey it's a  it's a  bit like you know <unclear/> I have no I make absolutely no bones about the fact that <unclear/> I do with St John Ambulance <pause dur="short"/> I'm obviously doing it because I want to have fun doing it</u>
<u n="531" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="532" who="S0179">um <pause dur="short"/> it will benefit people <pause dur="short"/> I'm not denying that <pause dur="short"/> but that's not</u>
<u n="533" who="S0058">that's that's not why you're doing it <pause dur="short"/> it's it's I mean</u>
<u n="534" who="S0179">that's not the main role <pause dur="short"/> and <unclear/></u>
<u n="535" who="S0058">but you're open about that</u>
<u n="536" who="S0179">but in this situation <trunc>i</trunc> there's no alternative which will benefit people more</u>
<u n="537" who="S0058">what by driving around?</u>
<u n="538" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's no</u>
<u n="539" who="S0058">really quickly</u>
<u n="540" who="S0179">there's no  sort I'm not <trunc>depr</trunc> I'm not doing a job that someone else could do better <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> for</u>
<u n="541" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="542" who="S0179">standards et cetera</u>
<u n="543" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="544" who="S0179">um <pause dur="short"/> and do you see what I mean? Whereas in this case it's no actually</u>
<u n="545" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> rather than students doing it <pause dur="short"/> english students</u>
<u n="546" who="S0179">english students? What?</u>
<u n="547" who="S0058">well English</u>
<u n="548" who="S0179">oh right</u>
<u n="549" who="S0058">students from England <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Not er yeah not not students of the English language</u>
<u n="550" who="S0179">and again</u>
<u n="551" who="S0058">that would be useless <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="552" who="S0179">it's fascinating how sort of oh yes Cameroon it's like poverty stricken ain't it <pause dur="short"/> there's people who are homeless in this country who you could probably build houses for</u>
<u n="553" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="554" who="S0179">but that wouldn't be very glamorous would it? Objectively if you went round and er you know a group of engineers <pause dur="short"/> got a bit a of council wasteland <pause dur="short"/> little bit of easing planning permission</u>
<u n="555" who="S0058">hm</u>
<u n="556" who="S0179">got and <trunc>knoc</trunc> spend a couple of weeks knocking up a essentially a scout hut that is a homeless refuge</u>
<u n="557" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="558" who="S0179">which would do a lot more good for a lot less money really</u>
<u n="559" who="S0058">hm</u>
<u n="560" who="S0179">wouldn't it <pause dur="short"/> but it's very funny how people choose to</u>
<u n="561" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> They choose to</u>
<u n="562" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="563" who="S0058">to do things in exotic <trunc>locatio</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> I was gonna say exotic locations <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure it wasn't very exotic but</u>
<u n="564" who="S0179">it is pretty exotic</u>
<u n="565" who="S0058">er <trunc>d</trunc> different places <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="566" who="S0179">Africa is exotic as a location</u>
<u n="567" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="568" who="S0179">but of course it's Africa it's poverty stricken <pause dur="short"/> therefore we feel good about ourselves cos we go and work in Africa</u>
<u n="569" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="570" who="S0179">again er this doesn't seem to be working terribly well</u>

<u n="575" who="S0058">I know <pause dur="short"/> ironic <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but yeah <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> it's what what I mean the <trunc>m</trunc> the main thing is that I think it massively stresses <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> out <pause dur="short"/> and I'm not sure he actually wants to do it or gets much enjoyment from it <pause dur="short"/> and I think it's ruining his life <pause dur="short"/> so <vocal desc="laugh"/> I figure he shouldn't do it <pause dur="short"/> and yeah I think cos he feels it's a more worthy hobby than or as he doesn't see it as a hobby <pause dur="short"/> he sees it as something worthy rather than um being in the orchestra or rowing <pause dur="short"/> can you turn it down a tiny bit? I'm struggling</u>

<u n="604" who="S0179">what? Uh</u>
<u n="605" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> okay this is different <pause dur="short"/> presumably we're just gonna go back onto the</u>
<u n="606" who="S0179">this is er er no this is we're going to Darlington</u>
<u n="607" who="S0058">I know we are <pause dur="short"/> but the there wasn't another way to get onto the A1</u>
<u n="608" who="S0179">assume this is too late</u>
<u n="609" who="S0058">as in I assume we can just get straight back up again</u>
<u n="610" who="S0179">I'd like to think so <pause dur="short"/> god that was er just to see a lorry move that quickly</u>
<u n="611" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="612" who="S0179">to be honest I'm surprised the lorry didn't roll over</u>
<u n="613" who="S0058">I think if we are we basically on the A66?</u>
<u n="614" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> road atlas I think <pause dur="short"/> if we need to we can cut up to a road that goes up via Middlesbrough <pause dur="short"/> what do you call it? The A?</u>
<u n="615" who="S0058">a19</u>
<u n="616" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="617" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="618" who="S0179">as in that comes in somewhere round here doesn't it?</u>
<u n="619" who="S0058">I'm not sure to be honest</u>
<u n="620" who="S0179">A lot of good you are</u>
<u n="621" who="S0058">oh I'm sorry</u>
<u n="622" who="S0179">sorry? There's a motorway in a mile <pause dur="short"/> this is different <pause dur="short"/> there was no warning about that</u>
<u n="623" who="S0058">no that was really bad</u>
<u n="624" who="S0179">surely</u>
<u n="625" who="S0058">I don't er get where you were supposed to go</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="626" who="S0179">I'm sure we've just sort of inadvertently drove past that psychopath and I forgot <pause dur="short"/> should've been a bit more cautious <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> I assume we're gonna encounter diversion signs? Cos I'm gonna follow the A66 unless something else emerges</u>
<u n="627" who="S0058">yeah well er yeah</u>
<u n="628" who="S0179">so er this is <unclear/></u>
<u n="629" who="S0058">well er we will come to a roundabout</u>
<u n="630" who="S0179">I like unexpected <unclear/> driving like this</u>
<u n="631" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Um <pause dur="short"/> we're gonna come to a roundabout <pause dur="short"/> um where</u>
<u n="632" who="S0179">yes I know <pause dur="short"/> those er roundabout signs gave that away <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="633" who="S0058">so yeah so if you wanna go straight over this one anyway <pause dur="short"/> um and then then it basically goes a bit woolly <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="634" who="S0179">well like I said I I assume there'll be</u>
<u n="635" who="S0058">we can stay on this road and then join the A19 <pause dur="short"/> we er basically we go um east straight across to Middlesbrough <pause dur="short"/> cos we kind of</u>
<u n="636" who="S0179">diverted traffic <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="637" who="S0058">oh right <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> we'll stick with that then cos we might be able to get just straight back up and back onto the A1 <pause dur="short"/> which would be better</u>
<u n="638" who="S0179">um</u>
<u n="639" who="S0058">if we</u>
<u n="640" who="S0179">it arguably would be faster to go across to Middlesbrough</u>
<u n="641" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> in that case we wanna</u>
<u n="642" who="S0179">Cos if we're going <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="643" who="S0058">we</u>
<u n="644" who="S0179">so we're gonna go straight on here <pause dur="short"/> what's <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="645" who="S0058">so and then we're gonna er <trunc>g</trunc> there's another roundabout <pause dur="short"/> do you wanna stay on the A66? Even though the diversion's</u>
<u n="646" who="S0179">well</u>
<u n="647" who="S0058">different</u>
<u n="648" who="S0179">can you well can you look at the route and tell us where the diversion will go?</u>
<u n="649" who="S0058">er it depends</u>
<u n="650" who="S0179">which should be obvious</u>
<u n="651" who="S0058">it it depends yeah it's probably gonna take us straight sort of up and it will just miss that one junction of the motorway</u>
<u n="652" who="S0179">so the motorway has come down to a single carriageway road <pause dur="short"/> jesus <pause dur="short"/> whose fucking great idea was this?</u>
<u n="653" who="S0058">er yeah there was no warning at all about that <pause dur="short"/> that was daft</u>
<u n="654" who="S0179">I didn't plan on seeing Darlington tonight</u>
<u n="655" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> No <pause dur="short"/> it's not unpleasant <pause dur="short"/> but you know <pause dur="short"/> um so yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's gonna be another roundabout and we can er either follow the diversion which is gonna be the second exit or we could take the third exit which is the A66 <pause dur="short"/> carry on on that whereas <trunc>j</trunc> and then that joins the um A19 at Middlesbrough</u>
<u n="656" who="S0179">are you confident you can navigate?</u>
<u n="657" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> if you'd rather do that</u>
<u n="658" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> let's do that</u>
<u n="659" who="S0058">and then the A19 then just goes up to the coast</u>
<u n="660" who="S0179">okay <pause dur="short"/> so we want the A66 <pause dur="short"/> yep <pause dur="short"/> great <pause dur="short"/> I like this er <unclear/> anything else</u>
<u n="661" who="S0058">so yeah we want</u>
<u n="662" who="S0179">I like this part of the country you know <pause dur="short"/> I do like the architecture and the</u>
<u n="663" who="S0058">yeah so we want the third exit <pause dur="short"/> teeside A66</u>
<u n="664" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="665" who="S0058">that yeah</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="666" who="S0179">of course a tiny proportion of these cars will actually be meaning to <vocal desc="laugh"/> go this way anyway</u>
<u n="667" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah so</u>
<u n="668" who="S0179">so not here</u>
<u n="669" who="S0058">not here <pause dur="short"/> the next one <pause dur="short"/> well that was an interesting diversion <pause dur="short"/> so <unclear/></u>
<u n="670" who="S0179">we'll make our own diversion damn you</u>
<u n="671" who="S0058">well that takes them a really odd route for that diversion <pause dur="short"/> very strange</u>
<u n="672" who="S0179">yeah I think this one'll be quicker</u>
<u n="673" who="S0058">take them like back along a little B road <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah so now we we stay on this road <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> we're gonna come to another roundabout <pause dur="short"/> we go straight over <pause dur="short"/> actually er we're gonna go through another two roundabouts where we go straight over <pause dur="short"/> but it should be fairly obvious <pause dur="short"/> they it's the  it's the  kind of the major road goes right through</u>
<u n="674" who="S0179">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="675" who="S0058">um then we come to another one where we wanna go right <pause dur="short"/> which is the second exit <pause dur="short"/> it's a sort of T-junction roundabout</u>
<u n="676" who="S0179">okay then</u>
<u n="677" who="S0058">um but I'll give you a shout when we get closer to that</u>
<u n="678" who="S0179">sorry T-function roundabout?</u>
<u n="679" who="S0058">well so it's a roundabout but there's only two exits and <trunc>w</trunc> and one faces left and one faces right</u>
<u n="680" who="S0179">well I suggest we don't refer to it as a T-junction</u>
<u n="681" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> sorry</u>
<u n="682" who="S0179">that's very confusing of you</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="683" who="S0058">it was nice being in a <trunc>w</trunc> in a sort of lit up bit like that <pause dur="short"/> I could see the map <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="684" who="S0179">yeah true</u>
<u n="685" who="S0058">we should get a little map torch <pause dur="short"/> or would that be too distracting?</u>
<u n="686" who="S0179">phone</u>
<u n="687" who="S0058">yeah no I'm I'm using it I'm not doing er I'm using my phone but it's just</u>
<u n="688" who="S0179">phones are perfect cos they're so low intensity light <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't distract the driver</u>
<u n="689" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was gonna say <pause dur="short"/> would a little torch be distracting? Potentially?</u>
<u n="690" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="691" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> fair enough <pause dur="short"/> it fine like I <trunc>c</trunc> you know I can see enough for this <pause dur="short"/> it's just normally I'm selecting quite odd menu options <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="692" who="S0179">you're not gonna accidentally shine it in my eyes</u>
<u n="693" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="694" who="S0179">football stadium</u>
<u n="695" who="S0058">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="696" who="S0179">are Darlington FC Premier League?</u>
<u n="697" who="S0058">no <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> No they're not</u>
<u n="698" who="S0179">it's a big stadium for a shit team</u>
<u n="699" who="S0058">not that big <pause dur="short"/> yeah so it's straight over this one</u>
<u n="700" who="S0179">got that</u>
<u n="701" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> But yeah er I told you it would be obvious <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Darlington Football Club <pause dur="short"/> I can't remember what league Darlington are</u>
<u n="702" who="S0179">what league are Preston?</u>
<u n="703" who="S0058">Preston? Oh <pause dur="short"/> preston North End's mm can't remember</u>
<u n="704" who="S0179">there's two clubs in Preston?</u>
<u n="705" who="S0058">no no as in that that's just what they're called I think</u>
<u n="706" who="S0179">okay</u>
<u n="707" who="S0058">there might be two clubs <pause dur="short"/> but that's that's what they're called <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="long"/> Yeah but not not Premier League <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Do you wanna go to the match at some point?</u>

<u n="713" who="S0058">um well if you wanna go and see Sunderland play</u>
<u n="714" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="715" who="S0058">so that you so you go as a supporter <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> you need to be in the <pause dur="short"/> ah no we <trunc>cou</trunc>  we <trunc>cou</trunc>  yeah in all fairness we could buy away tickets <pause dur="short"/> but make sure you get Sunderland tickets <pause dur="short"/> cos the fans are segregated of course <pause dur="short"/> and you need to be in the right end for your team <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="716" who="S0179">right</u>
<u n="717" who="S0058">otherwise it's a bit it's no it's not as much fun <pause dur="short"/> actually an away game would be good because the fans are really good <pause dur="short"/> no access to A66 East <pause dur="short"/> ah right <pause dur="short"/> that's where we wanna go <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> that's different</u>
<u n="718" who="S0179"><trunc>W</trunc> why is there no access to A66 East?</u>
<u n="719" who="S0058">er pff</u>
<u n="720" who="S0179">okay <pause dur="short"/> well quickly navigate</u>
<u n="721" who="S0058">yeah so the next roundabout we wanna go right instead <pause dur="short"/> sorry yeah <pause dur="short"/> at the next roundabout we're gonna go right <pause dur="short"/> which is the third exit <pause dur="short"/> instead of going straight over <pause dur="short"/> okay?</u>
<u n="722" who="S0179">okay <pause dur="short"/> how far's that roundabout?</u>
<u n="723" who="S0058">um <pause dur="short"/> not far along <pause dur="short"/> maybe a mile</u>
<u n="724" who="S0179">okay <pause dur="short"/> again information is good</u>
<u n="725" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> sure <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="726" who="S0179">you need to provide it</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="727" who="S0058">I'm hoping that we'll be able to join the A66 at the next junction down</u>
<u n="728" who="S0179">er</u>
<u n="729" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so we want the A67 here <pause dur="short"/> which is the third exit <pause dur="short"/> okay?</u>
<u n="730" who="S0179">what does that sign say?</u>
<u n="731" who="S0058">eastbound closed <pause dur="short"/> follow diversion <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> well yeah</u>
<u n="732" who="S0179">not er not another</u>
<u n="733" who="S0058">so it's taking us that way anyway</u>
<u n="734" who="S0179">fucking diversion</u>
<u n="735" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> what is it with them tonight? It might be best to follow this diversion because I don't know when the A66 opens again <pause dur="short"/> so um but <trunc>w</trunc> I'm gonna navigate and use the diversion and take whichever way I think's best</u>
<u n="736" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="737" who="S0058">and <trunc>t</trunc> and give you plenty of time <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="738" who="S0179">so they're going straight on anyway</u>
<u n="739" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="740" who="S0179">diversion is right</u>
<u n="741" who="S0058">so this is yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's here <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> so we just carry along er nothing happens for ages anyway on this road</u>
<u n="742" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="743" who="S0058">maybe for um six miles <pause dur="short"/> I don't even think there's any roundabouts</u>
<u n="744" who="S0179">six miles?</u>
<u n="745" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> we we it goes we're all almost all the way to Middlesbrough</u>
<u n="746" who="S0179">okay</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="747" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> like I said we'll see where this diversion takes us and see <trunc>w</trunc> whether we can actually get onto the A66 at all <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> cos if we can't we won't go the way I was thinking</u>
<u n="748" who="S0179">so the A66 would've taken us to the A6? Is that it?</u>
<u n="749" who="S0058">no the er A19</u>
<u n="750" who="S0179">okay <pause dur="short"/> we had er one number which was a multiple of three in part of its name</u>

<u n="752" who="S0179">sh</u>
<u n="753" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Close enough <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> what more do you want?</u>
<u n="754" who="S0179">well between nought and twenty there are <trunc>s</trunc> one and twenty there are six possibilities <pause dur="short"/> I think I did quite well to get one of them</u>
<u n="755" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Not bad <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I love how er yeah we've gone from the A1M to the um er road a with cycle path down one side</u>
<u n="756" who="S0179">that's more entertaining</u>
<u n="757" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> It is <pause dur="short"/> true <pause dur="short"/> oh right there is a roundabout <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> straight on here then <pause dur="short"/> oh yes there is a roundabout <pause dur="short"/> yes it's definitely straight on here <pause dur="short"/> tiny one</u>
<u n="758" who="S0179">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure the diversion will be straight on</u>
<u n="759" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="760" who="S0179">yes</u>
<u n="761" who="S0058">well er they er the you wouldn't the the other roads are just minor roads <pause dur="short"/> it wouldn't you wouldn't send us out there</u>
<pause dur="long"/>

<u n="769" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Fair enough <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> so er straight over here again <pause dur="long"/> There wasn't even a diversion sign there</u>
<u n="770" who="S0179">there was</u>
<u n="771" who="S0058">was there? Oh I missed that <pause dur="long"/> Okay <pause dur="short"/> on this  on this  road um when we come to it there's gonna be a junction</u>
<u n="772" who="S0179">okay <pause dur="short"/> why aren't you overtaking?</u>
<u n="773" who="S0058">rather than</u>
<u n="774" who="S0179">sorry <pause dur="short"/> what were you saying?</u>
<u n="775" who="S0058">um there's gonna be a junction which um there's a short stretch of A road which then take sort of maybe two miles which takes us to the A66 <pause dur="short"/> if the diversion doesn't take well that would be the way I'd navigate <pause dur="short"/> but if the  if the  diversion doesn't take us that way I'm not gonna go <pause dur="short"/> because it might not be open</u>
<u n="776" who="S0179">that's probably that road over there</u>
<u n="777" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> yeah so it's straight over here again</u>
<u n="778" who="S0179">Durham Tees Valley Airport</u>

<u n="965" who="S0058">fair enough</u>

<u n="967" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="968" who="S0179">but a heart and lung transplant <pause dur="short"/> that's like so the <trunc>signifi</trunc> your significant organs were someone else's</u>

<u n="1168" who="S0179">yeah</u>
<u n="1169" who="S0058">no no <pause dur="short"/> that's um that's <unclear/> that's kind of in Sunderland</u>
<u n="1170" who="S0179">that's not in Sunderland</u>
<u n="1171" who="S0058">herrington Country Park?</u>
<u n="1172" who="S0179">no you pillock <pause dur="short"/> the <trunc>s</trunc> outlet store</u>
<u n="1173" who="S0058">oh Dalton Park</u>
<u n="1174" who="S0179"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1175" who="S0058">oh no no that's in <unclear/> that's um the other direction</u>
<u n="1176" who="S0179">no it's not</u>
<u n="1177" who="S0058">oh no <pause dur="short"/> it's er it's much further north though than this</u>
<u n="1178" who="S0179">I don't believe you sometimes <pause dur="short"/> more specifically I don't believe I let you navigate</u>
<u n="1179" who="S0058">I if I'm  if I'm if I'm  looking at a map and I've found it and then I'd tell you where it was</u>
<u n="1180" who="S0179">yes but just the fact you fundamentally don't know it's in the same direction as Middlesbrough <pause dur="short"/> christ</u>
<u n="1181" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> it's twenty miles</u>
<u n="1182" who="S0179">no it's twenty miles five hundred er five hundred yards ago</u>
<u n="1183" who="S0058">okay <pause dur="short"/> so twenty miles less five hundred yards</u>
<u n="1184" who="S0179">no</u>
<u n="1185" who="S0058">bit more now</u>
<u n="1186" who="S0179">less one thousand yards <pause dur="short"/> keep it up</u>
<u n="1187" who="S0058">how come <trunc>roa</trunc> road signs are still in miles even though everything else has been sort of metrics?</u>
<u n="1188" who="S0179">everything else hasn't been <pause dur="short"/> er a lot of stuff's still in er imperial <pause dur="short"/> er speeds for example</u>
<u n="1189" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="1190" who="S0179">but er fundamentally they're just a better unit to measure speed and distance in</u>
<u n="1191" who="S0058">okay</u>
<u n="1192" who="S0179"><unclear/> used to and it's it's a bigger unit</u>
<u n="1193" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so it makes more sense</u>
<u n="1194" who="S0179">it is quite useful having both</u>
<u n="1195" who="S0058">Cos I mean like in a lot of countries they measure it in kilometres I guess <pause dur="short"/> and KPH would be the car's measurements <pause dur="short"/> speeds wise</u>
<u n="1196" who="S0179">yes <pause dur="short"/> but it's quite easy cos you have sort of thirty forty fifty-sixty</u>
<u n="1197" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="1198" who="S0179">they're very nice speeds <unclear/></u>
<u n="1199" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="1200" who="S0179">like sixty miles an hour <unclear/> to a mile a minute <pause dur="short"/> which is</u>
<u n="1201" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> nice to work it out</u>
<u n="1202" who="S0179">yeah exactly <pause dur="short"/> so you've got <unclear/></u>
<u n="1203" who="S0058">and I think like when we were used to other stuff before they changed it though <pause dur="short"/> like we'd have been used to the old system of weighing things <pause dur="short"/> and you could've said ah well I think people are just intrinsically used to it <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="1204" who="S0179">no but I mean because a mile's bigger I think it's a better unit</u>
<u n="1205" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no fair enough <pause dur="short"/> I'm just curious cos so much other stuff's been sort of switched over <pause dur="short"/> and like you're not allowed to sell um er you're not allowed to exclusively sell things in imperial units in shops <pause dur="short"/> like food wise</u>
<u n="1206" who="S0179">no it's er the European regulation <unclear/></u>
<u n="1207" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm just curious about why sort of roads <pause dur="short"/> presumably because it's to do with selling between countries and stuff <pause dur="short"/> whereas miles on the road doesn't really affect the other European countries</u>
<u n="1208" who="S0179">well <unclear/> you can still sell stuff in imperial <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="1209" who="S0058">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> but you'd have to have the metric on as well</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0179">no you <pause dur="short"/> would you er just shut up and let me finish what I'm saying</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0058">I'm sorry</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0179">no you don't <pause dur="short"/> if you look at in shops possibly <pause dur="short"/> but a lot of technical steels are still sold in half inch thickness for example</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0058">oh okay</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0179">which is to twelve point five four mil <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0058">okay</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0179">it's</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0058">that's interesting</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0179">yeah it's er inches are still in engineering it's still in very common usage <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> pSI as a unit of pressure for example <pause dur="short"/> pounds per square inch</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0058">interesting <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> maybe it's just sort of yeah <pause dur="short"/> I dunno really <pause dur="short"/> but I don't know why that would be different <pause dur="short"/> cos cos you can't sell food without the metric thing on <pause dur="short"/> because there was a guy in Sunderland like had a massive court battle about it <pause dur="short"/> cos he wanted to keep selling apples in pounds or whatever <pause dur="short"/> and they said no you've gotta have metric on your signs</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0179">incidentally er this was the right choice <pause dur="short"/> this is a much quieter much nicer road</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0058">hm <pause dur="short"/> fair enough</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0179">but a diverted randomly diverted and traffic worked</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0179">road worked er A1M would've been</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="long"/> I wouldn't say this was an American anthem</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0179">isn't it English?</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> No <pause dur="short"/> they're American <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> um I'm sort of er</u>

<u n="1231" who="S0058">how do I you oh no no they're American <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I only know that cos I've read <vocal desc="laugh"/> lots <unclear/> Um and Rufus um wrote a song about Brandon Flowers</u>

<u n="1257" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I I'm kind of torn about this <pause dur="short"/> because on the one hand I'm like does it really matter if they don't mean er like Idlewild a lot of the lyrics don't really mean anything and it's more about er the way they sound when he sings them <pause dur="short"/> so he sings kind of words round and round quite a lot</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0179">but surely a song should be about something?</u>
