<u n="130" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I think I've got like</u>
<u n="131" who="S0115">so there is I mean and of course they're increasing that aren't they uh that's a big thing in the news isn't it that they they dramatically increased</u>
<u n="132" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I'll have to work out how much <pause dur="short"/> fees yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0115">I read that I had the little German uh article from Der Spiegel</u>
<u n="134" who="S0037">yeah</u>

<u n="138" who="S0037">sorry student thing</u>
<u n="139" who="S0115">I did they did mention like that it was in you know in German from a German perspective but they didn't mention how Britain had got massively higher but it <trunc>w</trunc> it's worse in like America America's like America's pretty pretty hardcore for fees for uni fees I think or they seem to suggest</u>
<u n="140" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's true actually</u>
<u n="141" who="S0115">um <pause dur="short"/> I uh <pause dur="short"/> yeah I mean um <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>th</trunc> I I do think that that they should've maybe prevented them from going up <pause dur="short"/> like if they were gonna raise them to <trunc>s</trunc> if they're gonna like take away the government contribution that's that's one thing I mean that's not  that's not  great but</u>
<u n="142" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0115">it it's one thing but then to to allow unis to raise their price</u>
<u n="144" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="145" who="S0115">even further like um like three thousand on top of that uh</u>
<u n="146" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well I think like me  like me  granda's point was like he was saying that like he couldn't go to uni because you had to pay <pause dur="short"/> and then then after that you could pay <pause dur="short"/> like sorry then after that you didn't have to pay but like all the politicians now who are in are ones who are like they they were all the ones who had free university education <pause dur="short"/> it's just so rich that they like <pause dur="short"/> ah so like they had free education but we can't have it now</u>
<u n="147" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well this is the sort of thing that people get you know get really um</u>
<u n="148" who="S0037" trans="overlap">my granda gets so angry at it I mean he he was angry in itself like that even I had to pay I mean which I didn't have to pay actually but <pause dur="short"/> cos the my situation but</u>
<u n="149" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah neither did I because of yeah because of my my family wasn't earning as much at the time <pause dur="short"/> uh no I just yeah I mean I always get a bit sort of uh um I do get a bit like anti-fees sometimes because I think the the the <trunc>g</trunc> the country needs basically the county's gotta spend the government's gotta spend money to to improve the to improve education in a big way</u>
<u n="150" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0115">but a lot of that is uh is also secondary school education</u>
<u n="152" who="S0037">well yeah that's true</u>
<u n="153" who="S0115" trans="overlap">which is which I think a lot of people are just going to school and just wasting the opportunity</u>
<u n="154" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0115">or the schools aren't good enough and and that's so that's a problem <pause dur="short"/> but yeah I think in a better  in a better  country you should get like should get more  should get more  like opportunities for studying in a better country than um</u>
<u n="156" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0115">uh like the I I I just I would like to live in a country where where education was free basically <pause dur="short"/> and it was at uni</u>
