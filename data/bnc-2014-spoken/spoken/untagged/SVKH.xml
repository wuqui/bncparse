<u n="124" who="S0227">yeah well well we have quite a few different things on and you know as I say when it's dry and not too cold</u>
<u n="125" who="S0192">it hasn't rained too <trunc>mu</trunc> it hasn't rained much at all actually since I've been back</u>
<u n="126" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="127" who="S0190" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="128" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="129" who="S0190" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="130" who="S0227">August was was <trunc>c</trunc> er colder than average and September's been warmer erm than average</u>
<u n="131" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0227">so September's actually been a warmer month that August</u>
<u n="133" who="S0192">September was nice <pause dur="short"/> I think when I used to live here before I thought England was a very wet I mean it is wet but</u>
<u n="134" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0192">it's not actually that wet I looked at the the charts for how much you know water we actually get</u>
<u n="136" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0192">it averages about forty millimetres a month it's pretty much standard like across the whole year a little bit more in in erm November and those kind of months but I mean Korea in the height of their rainy season they receive two hundred and fifty millimetres in one month and that lasts for like two or three months</u>
<u n="138" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0192">and then their lowest month is forty <trunc>milli</trunc> is the same as England</u>
<u n="140" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0192" trans="overlap">so they they probably get about three or four times more rain than than we do but it it just rains more frequently in England than it</u>
<u n="142" who="S0227" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0192">it does in Korea does that make sense?</u>

<u n="154" who="S0227">mostly it was in the West Country</u>

<u n="771" who="S0192">who uses it more?</u>
<u n="772" who="S0227">er probably she does just about <pause dur="short"/> er okay right <pause dur="short"/> there's some similarities with chess this is the river that is the king er I've put them into English sign symbols cos yours are Chinese</u>
<u n="773" who="S0192">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="774" who="S0227" trans="overlap">it makes it so much harder I can I did memorise them but for simplicity it's easier to have these symbols right we'll go from that's the king he can only ever move erm <pause dur="short"/> in one square at a time he can go erm there there or there that's what he can do okay?</u>
<u n="775" who="S0192">can he go back?</u>
<u n="776" who="S0227">er yeah</u>
<u n="777" who="S0192">yeah okay so</u>
<u n="778" who="S0227" trans="overlap">but he can only move in that box that's a palace</u>
<u n="779" who="S0192">oh okay</u>
<u n="780" who="S0227" trans="overlap">that's the palace</u>
<u n="781" who="S0192" trans="overlap">you've gotta come out</u>
<u n="782" who="S0227">now what you've got is</u>
<u n="783" who="S0192">and you can't move diagonally in that box?</u>
<u n="784" who="S0227"><trunc>n</trunc> er no the ministers now the these are ministers they protect the king they can move <pause dur="short"/> diagonally like that</u>
<u n="785" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="786" who="S0227">so I'll take that back <pause dur="short"/> and that's all they can do they can move like to there and then to there or to there and then to there</u>
<u n="787" who="S0192">within the palace I guess</u>
<u n="788" who="S0227">within the palace that's all they can go in</u>
<u n="789" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="790" who="S0227">now what you've got then <pause dur="short"/> is so they are the counsellors then you've got the ministers the ministers basically erm can move diagonals but big on diagonals so there</u>
<u n="791" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="792" who="S0227">like that</u>
<u n="793" who="S0192">can they cross the river?</u>
<u n="794" who="S0227">no <pause dur="short"/> they can't cross the river so</u>
<u n="795" who="S0192">take that one back again</u>
<u n="796" who="S0227">and they can move to there to there unless there's something blocking it either an opponent or erm</u>
<u n="797" who="S0192">and it take it you can't move into the palace?</u>
<u n="798" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="799" who="S0192">no so you can only go that way and then that</u>
<u n="800" who="S0227" trans="overlap">knights move the same way as knights move but it it can be blocked but I have to <trunc>sh</trunc> demonstrate that further into the game erm now the knights can go over the river the cannons can go over the river and the rooks can go over your <trunc>riv</trunc> and I'll to <trunc>f</trunc> the rooks do exactly what they do the knights do exactly how they play in chess the L shape move but but not if something's blocking them</u>
<u n="801" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="802" who="S0227">your man or or</u>
<u n="803" who="S0192" trans="overlap">can't do <unclear/></u>
<u n="804" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="805" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no which you can do in chess</u>
<u n="806" who="S0227">yeah rooks do exactly the same so I don't need to tell you about what the rook</u>
<u n="807" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="808" who="S0227">what the rooks can do and what now the cannons are different now the cannons erm erm to take I can do this move it to there over the river <pause dur="short"/> but to take you I can't take him but I can take him you have to jump over something your own man or</u>
<u n="809" who="S0192">oh wow</u>
<u n="810" who="S0227">or the other</u>
<u n="811" who="S0192">you have to jump over something?</u>
<u n="812" who="S0227">to take it</u>
<u n="813" who="S0192">as if it's firing a cannon ball?</u>
<u n="814" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah if yeah to take it you can fire over your own man but it's it erm only takes the one it jumps over one thing you can't jump over two</u>
<u n="815" who="S0192">and it can't hit the thing</u>
<u n="816" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="817" who="S0192">it's got to jump over something</u>
<u n="818" who="S0227">it it takes whatever's behind it</u>
<u n="819" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="820" who="S0227">so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go into a game and you've <trunc>go</trunc> and I'm and I'll talk you how</u>
<u n="821" who="S0192">what about these things here?</u>
<u n="822" who="S0227">they're pawns or sorry pawns do as er pawns go up <trunc>t</trunc> they can go across the river</u>
<u n="823" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="824" who="S0227">once they go forward though and across the river they can't come back they can only keep moving forwards or sideways okay?</u>
<u n="825" who="S0192">and you take in a similar fashion you take diagonally?</u>
<u n="826" who="S0227">no you take straight ahead straight on</u>
<u n="827" who="S0192">oh right</u>
<u n="828" who="S0227">I'm gonna like now I'll go through a game and give you some like the tactics</u>
<u n="829" who="S0192">so is this what the chess that we play is based on?</u>
<u n="830" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="831" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="832" who="S0227">but there are <trunc>sim</trunc> there are similarities</u>
<u n="833" who="S0192">is this more complex?</u>
<u n="834" who="S0227">a little bit yeah</u>
<u n="835" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it is yeah it looks it</u>
<u n="836" who="S0227">right so what I'll do is er there's various different types of attack what you want to try and do is get out your rooks as soon as you possibly can but you you're moving to <trunc>d</trunc> so I move that to there that defends that pawn and it's defending that pawn he's moved his <trunc>coun</trunc> er his counsellor out</u>
<u n="837" who="S0192">oh he did move it into the palace</u>
<u n="838" who="S0227">you well you can right at the edge but you can't go inside it</u>
<u n="839" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="840" who="S0227">okay? erm so what I do then is erm <pause dur="short"/> I'm going to move that pawn up</u>
<u n="841" who="S0192">puts a whole different spin on it if you take vertically rather than</u>
<u n="842" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="843" who="S0192">diagonally</u>
<u n="844" who="S0227">he's done the same I'm going to bring <pause dur="short"/> this out to here this so far is protecting that pawn erm now what I will do now is I'll go</u>
<u n="845" who="S0192">and is the end of the game to checkmate</u>
<u n="846" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="847" who="S0192">your opponent?</u>
<u n="848" who="S0227">there's no draws in this</u>
<u n="849" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="850" who="S0192" trans="overlap">there's no draw</u>
<u n="851" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="852" who="S0192">why is there no draw?</u>
<u n="853" who="S0227">I just just the rules this a winner there's no draw</u>
<u n="854" who="S0192" trans="overlap">look like in chess where you can keep running around each other can you do that in the same in this? no</u>
<u n="855" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah no I don't think you can do that no right so that's that he's moved his his I'm gonna move my erm castle out as well <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="856" who="S0192">so I'm glad you play it</u>
<u n="857" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="858" who="S0192">very <unclear/></u>
<u n="859" who="S0227" trans="overlap">so he's that now attacking that pawn there</u>
<u n="860" who="S0192">oh</u>
<u n="861" who="S0227" trans="overlap">okay? er to defend it what I'll do is I'll move that to there which means he can be taken by that but then I go like that</u>
<u n="862" who="S0192">and take him</u>
<u n="863" who="S0227">but now I'm going to what's known as chain chain my er my er er is it? I'm getting confused here they're either ministers counsellors I'm gonna chain them they're now chained together are you with me? if that was there and that or they're chained so let me see if that gets taken they'll take it back okay</u>
<u n="864" who="S0192" trans="overlap">just automatic though?</u>
<u n="865" who="S0227">yeah well you could you don't have to do that</u>
<u n="866" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="867" who="S0227">but you that's what you you</u>
<u n="868" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="869" who="S0227">you're protecting each other they're chained together <pause dur="short"/> right so the next move I know that he's now attacking that pawn cos I've moved that one at a <trunc>t</trunc> to erm to nullify attack you if you move if you can move the piece out of the way</u>
<u n="870" who="S0192">because it has to jump over something?</u>
<u n="871" who="S0227" trans="overlap">has <trunc>some</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="872" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="873" who="S0227">if you right so if I was to move that there he will take me that's the most valuable piece that's the second most valuable that's the third that's the fourth er <pause dur="short"/> the last is the least valuable is the pawns</u>
<u n="874" who="S0192">do these play much?</u>
<u n="875" who="S0227">they're just defending the in in the palace</u>
<u n="876" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="877" who="S0227">okay? so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna my pawn up to there he's moved down he's coming in and he could slide that down to there but he won't because I've still got that there <pause dur="short"/> so now what I do is I'm I'm gonna do a straightforward it's not a very <trunc>ten</trunc> strategically complex but do that</u>
<u n="878" who="S0192">it completely changes the game doesn't it?</u>
<u n="879" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I've now taken that that was a stupid move I was just giving you a demo</u>
<u n="880" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="881" who="S0227">he's now took he took he took my my erm my knight and he's put me in check now to get out of check I <trunc>c</trunc> I I can do this move to there but I'm gonna</u>
<u n="882" who="S0192">oh</u>
<u n="883" who="S0227">yeah exactly or I'd do that</u>
<u n="884" who="S0192">yeah okay</u>
<u n="885" who="S0227">that's the move but what I'm gonna do is take these back</u>
<u n="886" who="S0192">oh you can go back as far as you want</u>
<u n="887" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah cos I'm I'm just showing you what <pause dur="short"/> so I'm not going to take that because I haven't I haven't protected that knight</u>
<u n="888" who="S0192">no okay</u>
<u n="889" who="S0227">so to protect that knight now</u>
<u n="890" who="S0192">pawns can't move sideways I take it?</u>
<u n="891" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="892" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="893" who="S0227">I will move that up to there that's now <trunc>protect</trunc>protecting that pawn he is now</u>
<u n="894" who="S0192">is he attacking?</u>
<u n="895" who="S0227">well he's not attacking anything directly but what I can do now is to to get him to move is <trunc>th</trunc>threaten him directly by doing that <pause dur="long"/> he's protected that by having my now when I move that pawn out the way erm he he becomes vulnerable</u>
<u n="896" who="S0192">how long did it take you to get to grips with this?</u>
<u n="897" who="S0227">probably about an hour</u>
<u n="898" who="S0192">oh</u>
<u n="899" who="S0227">and then I would make mistakes so he's now defended that by putting that down <vocal desc="misc"/> it's quite a tough tune to learn straight away</u>
<u n="900" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah I mean it changes the whole dynamic of the game doesn't it?</u>
<u n="901" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="902" who="S0192">it's like chess but not like chess</u>
<u n="903" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah so what I do now is I'm gonna threaten his erm now his rook by putting my cannon there</u>
<u n="904" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="905" who="S0227">he will move that which means I will take that cannon</u>
<u n="906" who="S0192">yeah okay so he's gonna get something</u>
<u n="907" who="S0227" trans="overlap">because if he doesn't yeah I'm gonna get something out of that <trunc>ch</trunc> this this will be a <trunc>str</trunc> superior strategy I believe unless there's something I haven't seen so I go like that</u>
<u n="908" who="S0192" trans="overlap">what setting are you playing this one?</u>
<u n="909" who="S0227">easy</u>
<u n="910" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="911" who="S0227">he's taken one of my ministers</u>
<u n="912" who="S0192">yeah</u>

<u n="914" who="S0192">he can take another one as well</u>
<u n="915" who="S0227" trans="overlap">I've he's but I will take that okay he will take he's come back up to there and taken that</u>
<u n="916" who="S0192">cannons are quite important then aren't they?</u>
<u n="917" who="S0227"><trunc>y</trunc>yeah</u>
<u n="918" who="S0192"><unclear/></u>
<u n="919" who="S0227" trans="overlap">he he will have lost a cannon now because <pause dur="short"/> erm I will do <pause dur="short"/> that and he will take my cannon <pause dur="short"/> but he's lost both his cannons now he hasn't got any</u>
<u n="920" who="S0192" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="921" who="S0227">I've still got one I lost a I lost a counsellor</u>
<u n="922" who="S0192">a counsellor that's what they're called</u>
<u n="923" who="S0227">so now what I need to do is is protect my cannon so I move it I could move it to there and it's protected by that and that er by the L shape</u>
<u n="924" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="925" who="S0227" trans="overlap">taking but what I'm going to do is erm <pause dur="long"/> in fact I will move it to there er no he's gonna double up on that so I'll go to there <pause dur="short"/> right he's now attacking my rook</u>
<u n="926" who="S0192">yeah okay</u>
<u n="927" who="S0227">see that?</u>
<u n="928" who="S0192">it's a bit hard to see it over the river isn't it?</u>
<u n="929" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="930" who="S0192">what's the purpose of the river?</u>
<u n="931" who="S0227">erm</u>
<u n="932" who="S0192">it's just that certain parts can't cross over there?</u>
<u n="933" who="S0227" trans="overlap"><trunc>ye</trunc>yeah exactly it's just the the the <trunc>di</trunc> the great divide so now what I do is I'm gonna attack his knight <pause dur="short"/> he's probably gonna he's although he's taken that he's probably he might come into here which means he will be attacking my <pause dur="short"/> my erm <pause dur="short"/> my minister but which is defended by that one <trunc>an</trunc>and that so what I do is I'll go there just see if that see what the promotes he's protected it <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="934" who="S0192">pawns don't seem to do much <pause dur="short"/> although can't he take you? oh no you said it's straight on</u>
<u n="935" who="S0227" trans="overlap">it's straight on yeah it's straight on so what</u>
<u n="936" who="S0192">can the pawns move two spaces at the beginning?</u>
<u n="937" who="S0227">no just the once so I'm gonna try a little tactic now I'm gonna move it up to here <pause dur="short"/> still defending <pause dur="short"/> ah he's sent his I was gonna move that to here and then take that that minister but he is now</u>
<u n="938" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah defending it</u>
<u n="939" who="S0227" trans="overlap">defending that minister by by doing that that's fine</u>
<u n="940" who="S0192">and the rook can jump over another rook?</u>
<u n="941" who="S0227">no <pause dur="short"/> rooks can only take they can't jump over things like they can't in chess</u>
<u n="942" who="S0192">but you said you were gonna move this here and then</u>
<u n="943" who="S0227" trans="overlap">I was and then double up but he's <trunc>defen</trunc> he's anticipated it he's already moved that there if he hadn't moved that there I was gonna slide that there</u>
<u n="944" who="S0192">and attack with this one</u>
<u n="945" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="946" who="S0192">okay</u>
<u n="947" who="S0227">and it would be checkmate if he <trunc>di</trunc> if he didn't do that but he's done <trunc>i</trunc> he's pre empted what I was gonna do so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to use this to take that there <pause dur="short"/> he's on the verge of crossing over the <trunc>riv</trunc> now erm <pause dur="short"/> what do I do now? <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="948" who="S0192">have you played this against real people?</u>
<u n="949" who="S0227">no <pause dur="short"/> no never</u>
<u n="950" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and what setting can you get to on the computer?</u>
<u n="951" who="S0227">er</u>
<u n="952" who="S0192">just easy?</u>
<u n="953" who="S0227">I I can beat it er I can beat it a lot of the times on easy not every time and the normal and there's like three <trunc>gr</trunc>grades after that</u>
<u n="954" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="955" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well I've only ever beaten it once</u>
<u n="956" who="S0192" trans="overlap">you've beaten it once <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="957" who="S0227">it's yeah it's quite tough</u>
<u n="958" who="S0192">so there's quite a bit of strategy to it then there must be</u>
<u n="959" who="S0227">indeed yeah</u>
<u n="960" who="S0192" trans="overlap">look at that yeah</u>
<u n="961" who="S0227">so <pause dur="short"/> what I do now I want to <pause dur="short"/> I'm gonna pop this up to here although it's not directly attacking the king now</u>
<u n="962" who="S0192">isn't it attacking the king now because it can jump over the?</u>
<u n="963" who="S0227" trans="overlap">no no there's nothing it the it's only attacking it if there's a piece in <trunc>bet</trunc></u>
<u n="964" who="S0192" trans="overlap">oh if there's something</u>
<u n="965" who="S0227" trans="overlap">in between it yeah</u>
<u n="966" who="S0192" trans="overlap">oh so it can attack this I mean</u>
<u n="967" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah but he's put that as far as I'm concerned he's put that in a in a bad place</u>
<u n="968" who="S0192" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="969" who="S0227">because now what I'm gonna do is <pause dur="short"/> that he's gotta move <pause dur="short"/> right he's he's protected that by moving that there and it can take me back</u>
<u n="970" who="S0192">yeah <pause dur="long"/> they're very limited those is it counsellors or ministers the ones in the box?</u>
<u n="971" who="S0227">er counsellors</u>
<u n="972" who="S0192">counsellors</u>
<u n="973" who="S0227">right <pause dur="short"/> I'm going to pop that into here which is gonna attack that</u>
<u n="974" who="S0192">yeah okay</u>
<u n="975" who="S0227" trans="overlap">that there</u>
<u n="976" who="S0192">next turn</u>
<u n="977" who="S0227">he is now attacking it so now what I do is I should be able to attack that pawn</u>
<u n="978" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="979" who="S0227">take that pawn and there's he can take that pawn I'm not worried about that</u>
<u n="980" who="S0192" trans="overlap">where do these ones move again?</u>
<u n="981" who="S0227">diagonally</u>
<u n="982" who="S0192" trans="overlap">diagonally like a bishop?</u>
<u n="983" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah he he's he's erm <pause dur="short"/> he's not chained it at the moment he has brought one out like that so if I go like I can't move it cos it's boxed in</u>
<u n="984" who="S0192">oh</u>
<u n="985" who="S0227" trans="overlap">you know what I mean? in normal chess you can go like that I can't</u>
<u n="986" who="S0192" trans="overlap">you can't just move it yeah</u>
<u n="987" who="S0227">cos I'm boxed in so what I've gotta do is protect it <pause dur="short"/> in fact I've lost it I can't move it</u>
<u n="988" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="989" who="S0227">I can't move it out of that it's gone unfortunately so and there's nothing I can do to to protect it <pause dur="short"/> so what I'll do then is I'll come back here and I've lost that knight</u>
<u n="990" who="S0192">it's gone</u>
<u n="991" who="S0227">but now I'm attacking</u>
<u n="992" who="S0192">and can</u>
<u n="993" who="S0227" trans="overlap">that's how</u>
<u n="994" who="S0192">your cannon jump over your own piece?</u>
<u n="995" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="996" who="S0192" trans="overlap">does that count as a jump?</u>
<u n="997" who="S0227" trans="overlap">I yeah I I could take</u>
<u n="998" who="S0192">because you've got your own piece there</u>
<u n="999" who="S0227" trans="overlap">that but I I'm gonna do is it with my <trunc>ro</trunc> my rook because that no I'm going to <trunc>atta</trunc> I'm going to take it with this one <pause dur="short"/> he won't take it with that because erm he would lose his rook by my rook by taking it but now what I do is is erm</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0192">hang on a minute oh no yeah</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0227">he's he doesn't need to it there's nothing he if that he can't have anything blocking that er said look even his own piece of mine</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0192">yeah yeah cos you yours is taken</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0227">but I can now take a piece of his if I've got a good piece by he's lost that now and I'll show you how when I take that down here that puts him into check he had to move than I then do that and I've taken his but I lost that</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0192">can you take that back just so I can see? you moved it down here and said it put him into check how?</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes because</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0192" trans="overlap">oh because your rook was</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes that exposes the rook</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0192">okay so yeah so</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0227" trans="overlap">okay so he can't do that so I'll take I will take another tack now I now put him back into check there he's gone back there so erm</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0192">you were gonna take this piece weren't you?</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah erm but I'm I've now changed my tack so if I go like that again he goes there</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0192">just keep going backwards and forwards</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0227" trans="overlap">I go to there now I'm attacking that what did he do there? oh he just took a pawn okay still not a problem erm I'm still chained so if he takes that I'll take him back</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1015" who="S0227">but now what I do is I take his <pause dur="short"/> erm minister sorry <trunc>couns</trunc> er minister I've jumped over like that that's got that he's taken see what he took? he he took my mine</u>
<u n="1016" who="S0192">and now you'll take him back</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0227">I can't because it it's I put my king into a check</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0192">oh okay yeah</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0227" trans="overlap">are you with me? so now I've gotta do something so what I do now</u>
<u n="1020" who="S0192" trans="overlap">the chain's a bit wide</u>
<u n="1021" who="S0227" trans="overlap">is I go like <pause dur="short"/> that</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0192">quite a lot of blood in this game isn't there?</u>
<u n="1023" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah now I'm in check I've got to block that with my <pause dur="short"/> and if he moves there I've lost</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0192">you move there</u>
<u n="1025" who="S0227">I'll do it again to see it's it's</u>
<u n="1026" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah that was quite good</u>
<u n="1027" who="S0227">and then I'll let you have a go</u>
<u n="1028" who="S0192">oh well can't we play against each other?</u>
<u n="1029" who="S0227">well you can but it's easier to learn against something that you can come back because it it's quite complicated cos it's in Chinese symbols</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0227">you've gotta first memorise all those</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0192" trans="overlap">that's half the fun isn't it?</u>
<u n="1033" who="S0227" trans="overlap">you've got to memorise all those symbols <pause dur="short"/> so if we go like that and we go new game okay?</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0192">there's only about six symbols though that shouldn't take me too long</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah but it's remembering what they are in in in relation to the board so now right I'll one how I normally work</u>
<u n="1036" who="S0192">can you not play two player on this? is there no way I can do this and you do that?</u>
<u n="1037" who="S0227">no just</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0192" trans="overlap">if we put it in the table</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0227">no it's just er</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0192">is there a two player?</u>
<u n="1041" who="S0227">not on this I don't think it's just you against the computer</u>
<u n="1042" who="S0192">that's very disappointing</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0227">erm right so <pause dur="short"/> I'll do my start er on this one I'll <pause dur="short"/> put that to there my next move is to get these pawns out cos that and let freeze up my attack for my knights so I'll go like that <pause dur="short"/> he's blocked my next move that way well not to worry I'll do that</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0192">he's just mirroring you</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0227">I'm then gonna do that to attack that pawn but he might take mine and I take his back bomb <pause dur="short"/> he does that my</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0192" trans="overlap">and he lost a cannon then</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0227" trans="overlap">that I lost a cannon we both traded off a cannon</u>

<u n="1058" who="S0192">I don't believe there's not a two player version of this on here surely</u>

<u n="2312" who="S0192">and I was very tempted cos that would've been a lovely schedule and I thought you know what? I'm here to do a degree I should do what I wanna do not just do an easier schedule I'm here to work</u>

<u n="2334" who="S0192">applied linguistics so I'll come out with an MA it's kind of nice and what <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I have said every time you get a new qualification to a certain degree it doesn't really matter what you did before <pause dur="short"/> when I got my degree didn't matter that I did shit in my A levels after that because I got a degree now so it doesn't really matter</u>
<u n="2335" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah it it nullifies it</u>

<u n="2346" who="S0192">yeah <pause dur="long"/> yeah it's not gonna be that chilled <pause dur="long"/> it's unacceptable though how much university costs nowadays I think</u>
<u n="2347" who="S0227">I suppose they had to transfer it over from the from the er from the state picking up the tabs there was too many bills erm too much debt to erm <unclear/> throwing the onus onto the individual</u>
<u n="2348" who="S0192">oh but does does university really cost that much? you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="2349" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well I</u>
<u n="2350" who="S0192">nine thousand pounds per person per per year</u>
<u n="2351" who="S0227" trans="overlap">I don't honestly know to be fair</u>
<u n="2352" who="S0192">no there's no way it does</u>
<u n="2353" who="S0227" trans="overlap">obviously they decided</u>
<u n="2354" who="S0192">how much are those lecturers being paid?</u>
<u n="2355" who="S0227">I don't know</u>
<u n="2356" who="S0192">lecturers are on about forty thousand pounds a year one lecturer sees how many students?</u>
<u n="2357" who="S0227">dunno</u>
<u n="2358" who="S0192">probably the average lecturer will probably teach between nine and twelve classes a week they will probably have contact with a hundred to a hundred and fifty students each paying nine thousand pounds a year and the lecturer's only getting forty grand for that well it doesn't add up it doesn't</u>
<u n="2359" who="S0227">no no</u>
<u n="2360" who="S0192" trans="overlap">make any sense</u>
<u n="2361" who="S0227">sounds like a lot but cos it's never affected me so I've never bothered to look into it</u>
<u n="2362" who="S0192">and how is it that the entirety of Europe can pretty much do uni for free or at least very very cheap?</u>
<u n="2363" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="2364" who="S0192">I mean it doesn't really make any sense basically all it is is just greed we're just following the American model</u>
<u n="2365" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well they don't thing is that they don't they don't think of the erm the rest of Europe have a welfare system like ours</u>
<u n="2366" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="2367" who="S0227">which erm erm exceedingly erm irksome</u>
<u n="2368" who="S0192">mm <pause dur="short"/> but we do spend quite a large chunk of our taxes on war quite a large chunk the majority of the money goes on war</u>
<u n="2369" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well <pause dur="short"/> I know that it costs er one point seven million pounds to deport Abu Qatada and he's been cleared in Jordan er</u>
<u n="2370" who="S0192" trans="overlap">how can it cost that much to deport someone? how does that make any sense?</u>
<u n="2371" who="S0227">the legal process he</u>
<u n="2372" who="S0192">right so somebody's being paid a bit too much there</u>
<u n="2373" who="S0227" trans="overlap">he resisted er and that's why yeah in in the end it cost them that's not including what he was erm claiming on benefits and stuff like that that's just the legal fees of his deportation of actually coming over a number of years so there was probably about four or five secretaries Theresa May was the successful one and tried to get him deported and he was like going through the all the different courts and that and getting it appealed and blah blah blah you know the Jordon court has found him innocent because the er a lot of the confessions were under torture and in a civilised society er you can't bring or use <trunc>tor</trunc> evidence <trunc>agai</trunc> obtained by torture as being erm it's probably is correct but</u>
<u n="2374" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I mean in a civilised society you shouldn't torture at all should you?</u>
<u n="2375" who="S0227" trans="overlap">it is probably correct but to be honest you could get anyone to confess anything <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="2376" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2377" who="S0227">if you're pulling their nails out so er with the absence of that evidence the courts er said there wasn't a strong enough case to and he was he was cleared but he can't come back here or else it would be an interesting case if if he suddenly turns up what are they going to do? and it <trunc>co</trunc> it cost one point seven million to just er deal with one individual</u>
<u n="2378" who="S0192">I mean <pause dur="short"/> we say it costs one point seven million but all that is is just a bunch of lawyers charging too much money isn't it really? I mean</u>
<u n="2379" who="S0227">it's yeah but it's</u>
<u n="2380" who="S0192" trans="overlap">how</u>
<u n="2381" who="S0227">well it's it's the process</u>
<u n="2382" who="S0192" trans="overlap">how much in resources did it cost?</u>
<u n="2383" who="S0227">erm I don't know about resources all I know is the figure that they said the one point seven million that's a lot of money for one individual <pause dur="short"/> where erm when I was watching Who Do You Think you Are? there's some black chap his his erm he <trunc>yo</trunc> it amazes me how by <trunc>s</trunc> flukes er er <trunc>s</trunc> er er happenstance erm you actually come to be here his erm it was in the papers it he's his he's estranged from his father I don't this the guy was on Who Do You Think You Are? he's either an actor or something or a singer or something I hadn't seen him before but yeah they do these celebrities and they do their family tree and er he'd been estranged from the father he sees him every now and again but not often he'd left his the father had left his mother when he was quite young</u>
<u n="2384" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2385" who="S0227">but you know seeing his dad his mother was a musician and his dad was from Ghana in Africa well er they were trying to deport him in eighty-two and he was he was contesting that under if you've got an English ancestor and you can prove this then you don't get deported</u>
<u n="2386" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="2387" who="S0227">well his his grandfather the celebrity's great grandfather was English and his name was Yates</u>
<u n="2388" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2389" who="S0227">but the the <trunc>trib</trunc> the funeral erm decided that the marriage that erm was had taken place between erm the his his father's parents sorry grandparents wasn't official so therefore they didn't recognise it fortunately cos his mother had got British she was from Africa she'd got British citizenship he was allowed to stay but it's amazing how then the rules changed because it he was his his this guy was gonna be deported his grandfather was English</u>
<u n="2390" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2391" who="S0227">but you have the likes say Abu Qatada we've never had any links with er Ghana was part of the commonwealth</u>
<u n="2392" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="2393" who="S0227">Jordon's never been part of the Commonwealth</u>
<u n="2394" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="2395" who="S0227">but they were allowed to come over here you know just a few years later er so that was a a you know how they the the rules suddenly changed but back to this guy and you know how you're lucky to be here his it turned out that his great grandfather was already married to an English woman and they had a couple of kids he was in the gold industry so the first he took them then his wife and that out in South Africa and then he went alone to the to to <trunc>Gh</trunc>Ghana which was known as the kind of like the white man's grave so the wives never used to go there he then fell in with a native girl and had a child he left the country due to illness I think while she was pregnant came back and then they obviously split up but he left his son well provided for <pause dur="short"/> but you think to yourself if <pause dur="short"/> his great grandfather had not gone to you know out into the world</u>
<u n="2396" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="2397" who="S0227">to find work er this was what he did gold mining he would never exist because he wouldn't have met his great grandmother out in Africa</u>
<u n="2398" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="2399" who="S0227">and had but ironically this guy he had English ancestry from two both sides of his <trunc>fam</trunc>family er on his father's side his mother's his erm his great great <trunc>grandf</trunc> father was also English</u>
<u n="2400" who="S0192">so he's got quite a few ties</u>

<u n="2402" who="S0192" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="2403" who="S0227">it's such a I mean it's like Oliver Cromwell er there was a vote going ahead and he he's you know this is well before the <trunc>cri</trunc> the civil war he's a member of Parliament and he said if if I don't if the er vote goes against us I'm going to the new world he had married at the time the vote he they won the vote by one one vote and he stayed he married <pause dur="short"/> his wife he had already met and had children instead of going to to the US</u>
<u n="2404" who="S0192">yeah</u>

<u n="2415" who="S0227">no you would have you would still have erm twenty-three sets of your mother's DNA and erm twenty and her mitochondria but you <trunc>would</trunc> for you it would be someone totally different to you you wouldn't even recognise er them as being er or you could look at <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and say that's how close I would be to me</u>

<u n="2426" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="2427" who="S0227">and then there's another half of you which would be from me that wouldn't be you you'd have my twenty-three sets of my chromosomes but you wouldn't have my mitochondria er er and that wouldn't be your mother so it's <trunc>tot</trunc> it just wouldn't be you</u>
<u n="2428" who="S0192">that's a bit strange</u>

<u n="2493" who="S0227">there was cross I always <trunc>sus</trunc>suspected that there would have been but there is cross breeding with us and Neanderthals</u>
<u n="2494" who="S0192">yeah I mean there has to be</u>
<u n="2495" who="S0227" trans="overlap">because it I can see that because erm <pause dur="short"/> okay they're not they're not stunners er but I don't think people were that into aesthetics at the time if you killed the Neanderthal men they were stronger than us and they had tools they had their er</u>

<u n="2498" who="S0192">so it's possible to interbreed then there we would've produced young</u>
<u n="2499" who="S0227" trans="overlap">the well we have we have they reckon about two percent of our DNA is Neanderthal <pause dur="short"/> some are more some are up to about three it's between one and three percent some have got more <trunc>DN</trunc> Neanderthal in them</u>
<u n="2500" who="S0192">is there any connection between intelligence and how much Neanderthal gene you have?</u>
<u n="2501" who="S0227">no but Neanderthals weren't that stupid they had tools er they erm add erm yeah they were just they were just as as er they were stronger than us and they were they were here in Europe before us they were er our colour where the people that the Homo sapiens that they encountered were black they come out of Africa</u>

<u n="2507" who="S0227">they yeah no they did have a language but not as sophisticated as they didn't</u>
<u n="2508" who="S0192">that's what I'm saying because their reduced to consonants it's</u>
<u n="2509" who="S0227" trans="overlap">they didn't pass things on</u>
<u n="2510" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2511" who="S0227">they kept very much to themselves in in troops they didn't like oh I've developed something and I go out and I show someone else it's somewhere else they didn't do that</u>
<u n="2512" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="2513" who="S0227">hence technologically they started to fall behind strong they were stronger than us <event desc="sound of phone"/> hello hello <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
