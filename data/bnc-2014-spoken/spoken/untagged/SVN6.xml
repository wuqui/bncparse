<u n="114" who="S0427" trans="overlap">the dissertations</u>
<u n="115" who="S0426" trans="overlap">been struck <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="116" who="S0427" trans="overlap">one was poor one was good</u>
<u n="117" who="S0426">but just in the ordinary sort of the way that of er of poorness and goodness? like</u>
<u n="118" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0426" trans="overlap">everybody else</u>
<u n="120" who="S0427" trans="overlap">I mean</u>
<u n="121" who="S0426" trans="overlap">can be poor and good? yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0427">yeah erm <trunc>ju</trunc> just er just normal third year undergraduate stuff you know</u>
<u n="123" who="S0426">fine</u>

<u n="125" who="S0426"><trunc>b</trunc>but surely these are we're talking about MSCs aren't we?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0427">yes well I had two things here I had proposals from three four MSC students</u>
<u n="127" who="S0426">right</u>
<u n="128" who="S0427">it was postgraduates and I</u>
<u n="129" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="130" who="S0427" trans="overlap">also had two undergraduate dissertations which were late handed in</u>
<u n="131" who="S0426">okay right</u>
<u n="132" who="S0427">and the deadlines and the deadlines for the dissertations as such and the proposals that with the students here on and it really had to be done on the weekend so</u>
<u n="133" who="S0426">well they're going to be sent off for the external any time soon aren't they? very very imminently I think</u>
<u n="134" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yes and <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> deals with that yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0426">not that they must well we've had this discussion before not that they can do much about it <pause dur="short"/> that they will do much about they can't do much about it</u>
<u n="136" who="S0427">no no I mean I I I think the <unclear>role</unclear> would be well I think you're consistently over-marking</u>
<u n="137" who="S0426"><trunc>e</trunc>exactly</u>
<u n="138" who="S0427" trans="overlap">or under-marking or</u>

<u n="141" who="S0426"><trunc>exac</trunc></u>
<u n="142" who="S0427"><trunc>m</trunc>more constructively erm er we had this a few years ago was somebody said you know you've got some bright students why don't you encourage them</u>
<u n="143" who="S0426" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="144" who="S0427" trans="overlap">to do more empirical work rather than be play safe with the with their graphical? <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0426" trans="overlap">it's not I've seen I've seen in</u>
<u n="146" who="S0427" trans="overlap">and in fact that's what we've done now</u>
<u n="147" who="S0426" trans="overlap">it's interesting</u>
<u n="148" who="S0427" trans="overlap">we we've not we've not put it in <pause dur="short"/> a regulation it must be empirical</u>
<u n="149" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes yes right</u>
<u n="150" who="S0427">but we really</u>
<u n="151" who="S0426" trans="overlap">you allow</u>
<u n="152" who="S0427" trans="overlap">have encouraged and I would say perhaps say to you ninety percent of all of our undergraduates now do</u>
<u n="153" who="S0426" trans="overlap">interesting</u>
<u n="154" who="S0427" trans="overlap">some form of empirical work</u>
<u n="155" who="S0426" trans="overlap">interesting</u>
<u n="156" who="S0427">and it's actually made much more interesting for me</u>
<u n="157" who="S0426">I'd have thought so</u>
<u n="158" who="S0427">erm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0426">I think really the empirical piece is bound to be at least a bit original</u>
<u n="160" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0426">whereas a rehashing er well rehashing a long essay's just a long essay basically</u>
<u n="162" who="S0427">one of our students did something I thought was really rather clever it and I'm not even sure I'm using this correctly it might have been even phenomenological</u>
<u n="163" who="S0426">wow</u>
<u n="164" who="S0427">because she did a study of her fellow students on the third year of the criminology course</u>
<u n="165" who="S0426">yes</u>
<u n="166" who="S0427">to see whether the <pause dur="short"/> information on crime and justice had altered their <pause dur="short"/> er opinions on er punishment and rehabilitation and things like that</u>
<u n="167" who="S0426">but did she do it before and after?</u>
<u n="168" who="S0427">er I think she compared it with people who were non criminology students <pause dur="short"/> you couldn't do a before and after</u>
<u n="169" who="S0426" trans="overlap"><trunc>ye</trunc> <trunc>ye</trunc> yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0427" trans="overlap">because you know</u>
<u n="171" who="S0426" trans="overlap">ah mm</u>
<u n="172" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah I know what you mean but we it it's not perfect</u>
<u n="173" who="S0426" trans="overlap"><trunc>ye</trunc> oh</u>
<u n="174" who="S0427" trans="overlap">empiricism but</u>
<u n="175" who="S0426">you're right</u>
<u n="176" who="S0427" trans="overlap">you know</u>
<u n="177" who="S0426">all that</u>
<u n="178" who="S0427" trans="overlap">you know</u>
<u n="179" who="S0426" trans="overlap">all that <unclear/> said <trunc>wa</trunc> you know criminology <trunc>b</trunc> students mm</u>
<u n="180" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0426">think differently or say differently from</u>
<u n="182" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah okay</u>
<u n="183" who="S0426" trans="overlap">non criminology students whether they'd change when they were</u>
<u n="184" who="S0427" trans="overlap">there may be there may be more to it than that</u>
<u n="185" who="S0426" trans="overlap">alright okay yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0427" trans="overlap">because I I wasn't supervising</u>
<u n="187" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah yeah alright</u>
<u n="188" who="S0427" trans="overlap">this at all</u>
<u n="189" who="S0426" trans="overlap">okay that's alright</u>
<u n="190" who="S0427">but erm but I yeah I thought that was er quite</u>
<u n="191" who="S0426" trans="overlap">good for her</u>
<u n="192" who="S0427" trans="overlap">a more interesting use of students</u>
<u n="193" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes yes yes</u>
<u n="194" who="S0427" trans="overlap">rather than the the stuff on drugs</u>
<u n="195" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="196" who="S0427">or drink or er</u>
<u n="197" who="S0426">which there's more normal</u>
<u n="198" who="S0427">mm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0426">but do they get any research methods training from you?</u>
<u n="200" who="S0427">er yeah they do it I think jointly with the sociology people</u>
<u n="201" who="S0426">okay right okay</u>
<u n="202" who="S0427" trans="overlap">I think it's now jointly one</u>
<u n="203" who="S0426" trans="overlap">so not thrown into the deep end?</u>
<u n="204" who="S0427">no no no</u>
<u n="205" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="206" who="S0427">no and and to be fair <pause dur="short"/> very few of them for instance do anything with requiring SPSS</u>
<u n="207" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="208" who="S0427">it's it's I wouldn't say it's advanced it it tends to be things like online questionnaires</u>
<u n="209" who="S0426">right</u>
<u n="210" who="S0427">or semi-structured interviews or maybe a focus group</u>
<u n="211" who="S0426">fine</u>
<u n="212" who="S0427">and a limited number of people</u>
<u n="213" who="S0426" trans="overlap">sure</u>
<u n="214" who="S0427" trans="overlap">you know it it would be churlish of us to say well we're it's brilliant but we're not gonna give you any marks because it's it there's there's the sample's too small you know</u>
<u n="215" who="S0426">I mean with a with an online questionnaire you can reasonably easily knock up a hundred people</u>
<u n="216" who="S0427">yes but it's it's difficult for instance if you wanted to interview some police officers just</u>
<u n="217" who="S0426" trans="overlap">oh no no</u>
<u n="218" who="S0427" trans="overlap">just to get</u>
<u n="219" who="S0426" trans="overlap">if you're doing</u>
<u n="220" who="S0427">seven or eight</u>
<u n="221" who="S0426" trans="overlap">no no no</u>
<u n="222" who="S0427">is doing brilliantly</u>
<u n="223" who="S0426" trans="overlap">that's fantastic</u>
<u n="224" who="S0427" trans="overlap">you know yeah</u>
<u n="225" who="S0426" trans="overlap">no that's a difficult kettle of fish</u>
<u n="226" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="227" who="S0426">but</u>
<u n="228" who="S0427" trans="overlap">no you're right with online stuff</u>
