<u n="51" who="S0018">well that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> I think a lot of people nowadays are <trunc>d</trunc> relying on their mobile phones</u>
<u n="52" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0018">to do things like keep appointments</u>
<u n="54" who="S0019">mhm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0018">and stuff <pause dur="short"/> but it's such a difficult interface</u>
<u n="56" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="57" who="S0018">I for for example I much prefer to write something down</u>
<u n="58" who="S0019">mm</u>

<u n="73" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Aw</u>
<u n="74" who="S0019">but Tom's very nice</u>
<u n="75" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="76" who="S0019">very young <pause dur="short"/> but very nice <pause dur="short"/> very pleasant <pause dur="short"/> and he was much kinder to me than <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is <pause dur="short"/> he didn't put things at me very hard <pause dur="short"/> and he didn't put things at me where I got to run a lot</u>
<u n="77" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="78" who="S0019">which was very nice of him <pause dur="short"/> um but no it was interesting</u>
<u n="79" who="S0018">do you find tennis to be a good workout? Because whenever I've</u>
<u n="80" who="S0019">oo yes</u>
<u n="81" who="S0018">whenever I've played tennis I don't actually find it to be that</u>
<u n="82" who="S0019">if you're playing a game <pause dur="short"/> doubles particularly <pause dur="short"/> no it's not <pause dur="short"/> but this is a lesson where we're doing various drills and practices <pause dur="short"/> and then we play singles at the end <pause dur="short"/> and that is hard work</u>
<u n="83" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0019">Cos you've got to cover the whole of the court <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so yes it it it is a good workout <pause dur="short"/> it certainly makes me</u>
<u n="85" who="S0018">so maybe I</u>
<u n="86" who="S0019">out of breath</u>
<u n="87" who="S0018">maybe I just wasn't doing it right <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="88" who="S0019">no doubles when we play doubles at the end of the Monday night it's not <pause dur="short"/> you don't get that many rallies going in doubles</u>
<u n="89" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0019">um <pause dur="short"/> and it just isn't isn't the same</u>
<u n="91" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0019">so no the the the lessons themselves are a good workout</u>
<u n="93" who="S0018">and what about the aqua aerobics? Is that a good workout? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0019">it depends <pause dur="short"/> it aqua aerobics is the sort of thing you can do as hard or not as you like <pause dur="short"/> depends entirely how much you use the water for resistance</u>
<u n="95" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0019">um <pause dur="short"/> and most people don't strangely enough <pause dur="short"/> the whole idea of aqua aerobics is to use the water <trunc>re</trunc> as resistance <pause dur="short"/> but you can't do that unless you're actually below surface of the water</u>
<u n="97" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0019">and so many people are up way out of the water so their arms are half in the water instead of right down <pause dur="short"/> cos when you're pulling and pushing against the water</u>
<u n="99" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's when the <trunc>re</trunc></u>
<u n="100" who="S0019">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0018">you get</u>
<u n="102" who="S0019">and it's so you can make it as easy or as hard as you like <pause dur="short"/> depending on how you feel on the night</u>
<u n="103" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="104" who="S0019">depending on how cold the water is</u>
<u n="105" who="S0018">oo</u>
<u n="106" who="S0019"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="107" who="S0018">Brr</u>
<u n="108" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="109" who="S0019">and lately they've had trouble with the boiler <pause dur="short"/> and it the temperature of the water was definitely down <pause dur="short"/> and then the <trunc>bul</trunc> the boiler bust completely <pause dur="short"/> so it was out of commission <pause dur="short"/> the pool was out of commission for a couple of days</u>
<u n="110" who="S0018">oh dear</u>
<u n="111" who="S0019">yep <pause dur="short"/> not good <pause dur="short"/> and the spa pool was out as well cos all the boiler heats all the water</u>
<u n="112" who="S0018">is the spa pool usually hot?</u>
<u n="113" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's lovely</u>
<u n="114" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="115" who="S0019">just go and sit in it and it bubbles <pause dur="short"/> and it's lovely</u>
<u n="116" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="117" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's lovely</u>
<u n="118" who="S0018">but aqua aerobics are you supposed to be I mean you <trunc>ha</trunc> your feet have to be on the floor</u>
<u n="119" who="S0019">oh yes</u>
<u n="120" who="S0018">I imagine</u>
<u n="121" who="S0019">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0018">on the</u>
<u n="123" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0018">bottom of the swimming pool</u>
<u n="125" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's just the same in many ways as doing um an aerobics session on the floor</u>
<u n="126" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0019">except that you're using the water as resistance instead of using weights and things like that</u>
<u n="128" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="129" who="S0019">but it certainly is a good workout</u>
<u n="130" who="S0018">no I'd do it if it was er in the Mediterranean</u>
<u n="131" who="S0019"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="132" who="S0018">and warm and sunny</u>
<u n="133" who="S0019">yes <pause dur="short"/> wouldn't we all?</u>

<u n="135" who="S0019">oh yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was thinking of maybe trying that <pause dur="short"/> but they've just got so many different classes that I just don't know</u>
<u n="137" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> what to do</u>
<u n="139" who="S0019">well you're best off keeping it I don't know whether they have a a a system where you can see how difficult the class is <pause dur="short"/> they do at David Lloyd</u>
<u n="140" who="S0018">I don't know</u>
<u n="141" who="S0019">it's colour <trunc>co</trunc> coordinated so that you know how what sort of level it is</u>
<u n="142" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="143" who="S0019">you would be better to pick something on a fairly low level to start with to see what it's like</u>
<u n="144" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="145" who="S0019">Cos there's no point in going in one of the hard ones and then being put off completely</u>
<u n="146" who="S0018">hm <pause dur="short"/> yes I just don't want to go er to any of the classes that have got boom boom boom music</u>

<u n="154" who="S0018">yeah?</u>
<u n="155" who="S0019">and the music that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> uses um she's got these sort of compilations of sixties and seventies</u>

<u n="158" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="159" who="S0019">and we all know the words</u>

<u n="294" who="S0019">oh yes</u>
<u n="295" who="S0018">concentration</u>

<u n="301" who="S0018">yes</u>

<u n="304" who="S0019">it's very easy to get things in the wrong order to start with</u>

<u n="306" who="S0019">but no as I say remember it's only your second lesson so</u>
<u n="307" who="S0018">no it's true</u>

<u n="309" who="S0018">it's <trunc>ju</trunc></u>
<u n="310" who="S0019">you'll be fine</u>
<u n="311" who="S0018">he is kind of I <trunc>f</trunc> I feel that he's making he's taking me quite quicky cos he can see that I'm quite capable <pause dur="short"/> and whereas I can do it er I know whereas I know I can do it when he's there telling me what to do I don't feel confident in doing it without him telling me to do it <pause dur="short"/> so in a way I kind of wish that he wouldn't take me so quickly</u>
<u n="312" who="S0019">in which case</u>
<u n="313" who="S0018">to new things</u>
<u n="314" who="S0019">yeah</u>
<u n="315" who="S0018">and</u>
<u n="316" who="S0019">say that to him</u>
<u n="317" who="S0018">but the  but the  thing is I also want to you see I don't know whether huh it's probably cos I'm just not getting practice <pause dur="short"/> but then again no I don't think it's that I'm not getting practice <pause dur="short"/> I think I just would prefer for him to take me through it and then let me do it myself two or three times</u>
<u n="318" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="319" who="S0018">and then give me feedback</u>
<u n="320" who="S0019">mhm</u>
<u n="321" who="S0018">and then</u>
<u n="322" who="S0019">well say that to him</u>
<u n="323" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="324" who="S0019">that's the most important part <pause dur="short"/> getting the instructor</u>
<u n="325" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="326" who="S0019">to do it the way in which you feel more comfortable <pause dur="short"/> and if that's</u>

<u n="329" who="S0018"><vocal desc="yawn"/> At the moment I'll defer to his expertise <pause dur="short"/> but um you see for example if I said if I told him the way I want to do it I E please take me where there are no other cars at all</u>

<u n="331" who="S0018">it's probably actually not a very good thing for me to learn how to drive</u>

<u n="333" who="S0018">in a vacuum without other cars around is it <pause dur="short"/> cos</u>
<u n="334" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="335" who="S0018">and you get used to</u>
<u n="336" who="S0019">it it's true <pause dur="short"/> and as I said before it is only your second lesson</u>
<u n="337" who="S0018">I know but tomorrow he wants us going up the <anon type="place"/> doing sixty miles an hour in fourth gear</u>
<u n="338" who="S0019">right</u>
<u n="339" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Or maybe forty miles an hour in fourth gear</u>
<u n="340" who="S0019">I was just going to say I don't think he'd make <vocal desc="laugh"/> you go sixty miles an hour down the <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="341" who="S0018">forty miles an hour in fourth gear he said</u>

<u n="343" who="S0018">Down the <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="344" who="S0019">yes <pause dur="short"/> because you'd be speeding if you did</u>
<u n="345" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="346" who="S0019">sixty miles an hour down the <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> it depends on which bit of the <anon type="place"/> he's going to take you on</u>
<u n="347" who="S0018"><vocal desc="yawn"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="348" who="S0019">he'll probably take you to <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="349" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="350" who="S0019">turn left <pause dur="short"/> and then left by Safeways so that you come off the <anon type="place"/> there</u>
<u n="351" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="352" who="S0019">and that's perfectly straight</u>
<u n="353" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="354" who="S0019">er it's two two lanes of traffic <pause dur="short"/> so you'll be fine</u>
<u n="355" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> well luckily so far all the other cars that I've encountered have been <vocal desc="laugh"/> very patient</u>
<u n="356" who="S0019">most people are</u>
<u n="357" who="S0018">yes <pause dur="short"/> good <pause dur="short"/> but I when I see another car I'm always thinking oh God if I was a</u>
<u n="358" who="S0019">no no no</u>
<u n="359" who="S0018">if I was a driver like was it you yesterday? I hate it when people do that <pause dur="short"/> I hate it when people don't</u>
<u n="360" who="S0019">yeah</u>
<u n="361" who="S0018">pull out when you're signalling for them to pull out <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="362" who="S0019">it's it's that they don't look</u>
<u n="363" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="364" who="S0019">that's what annoys me <pause dur="short"/> that they don't look at you and see what you are doing and er act accordingly <pause dur="short"/> it drives me round the bend</u>
<u n="365" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="366" who="S0019">but <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc></u>
<u n="367" who="S0018">what drives me round the bend is people who don't signal <pause dur="short"/> so you don't know where they're going</u>
<u n="368" who="S0019">yes <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> and if that happens you have to work on the principle that they are going to go where you want to go and you let them go</u>
<u n="369" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="370" who="S0019">if subsequently they turn off that's fine <pause dur="short"/> but it's you don't assume anything when you're driving <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't do</u>
<u n="371" who="S0018">yes I know <pause dur="short"/> but I just don't know the <trunc>h</trunc> think I have any more mental space</u>
<u n="372" who="S0019">oh yes you do</u>
<u n="373" who="S0018">no no no but I I'm thinking about so many things at once</u>
<u n="374" who="S0019">yes you're thinking about them now <pause dur="short"/> but as you go on you won't have to think about them</u>
<u n="375" who="S0018">oh that's good</u>
<u n="376" who="S0019">it'll come automatically <pause dur="short"/> so you know</u>
<u n="377" who="S0018">the clutch thing kinda comes</u>
<u n="378" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="379" who="S0018">quite naturally now</u>
<u n="380" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="381" who="S0018">but not changing gears <pause dur="short"/> and why you have to change gears <pause dur="short"/> and what gear it's best to be in at a given moment</u>
<u n="382" who="S0019">well that's something you just learn by experience</u>
<u n="383" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="384" who="S0019">but say I used to tell grandad by the sound of the engine when he was going to change gear</u>
<u n="385" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="386" who="S0019">so again you'll find that'll come</u>
<u n="387" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="388" who="S0019">with time <pause dur="short"/> but you do need to get some practice in <pause dur="short"/> so I suppose I have to speak to your father about getting you on my insurance to drive my car</u>
<u n="389" who="S0018">not if you're not happy doing that</u>
<u n="390" who="S0019">oh I it's I'm it's not so I'm not happy about you going out practising <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm more concerned about you passing your test and wanting my car</u>
<u n="391" who="S0018">oh gosh no</u>
<u n="392" who="S0019"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="393" who="S0018">I'd never do that <pause dur="short"/> it's your car isn't it</u>
<u n="394" who="S0019">you're not having my car</u>
<u n="395" who="S0018">it's your car <pause dur="short"/> of course I wouldn't</u>
<u n="396" who="S0019">you wouldn't manage you father's car anyway</u>
<u n="397" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="398" who="S0019">I think you'll find that's just too big</u>
<u n="399" who="S0018">Don't think I'd manage my father either <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="400" who="S0019">huh <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Well the problem is if you could put tape round his mouth and let him just sit there</u>
<u n="401" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="402" who="S0019">and not say anything <pause dur="short"/> you'd probably be alright</u>
<u n="403" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="404" who="S0019">um but I'm not sure that I would be much better</u>
<u n="405" who="S0018">oh no I think you would be <pause dur="short"/> but again I <trunc>d</trunc> I <trunc>j</trunc> I'm not particularly confident going out on the</u>
<u n="406" who="S0019">no</u>
<u n="407" who="S0018">roads</u>

<u n="411" who="S0018">dual control</u>

<u n="414" who="S0019">you've got to get used to it</u>
<u n="415" who="S0018">or what I'd maybe like to do with you would be to go to the old <unclear/> carpark or something <pause dur="short"/> and just practise <pause dur="short"/> like have no other cars around and just practise the whole mechanics of what do you do when you come up to a junction if you're in second gear and you have to stop and duddle uddle uddle er <pause dur="short"/> and just practise it <pause dur="short"/> and get some feedback on</u>
<u n="416" who="S0019">what does?</u>

<u n="425" who="S0018">myself alive <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="426" who="S0019">no no that's you will find that that becomes almost automatic after a while <pause dur="short"/> you won't even have to think about it <pause dur="short"/> cos if you're in second gear and you're coming up to a junction clutch brake neutral handbrake</u>
<u n="427" who="S0018">hm <pause dur="short"/> yep</u>
<u n="428" who="S0019">it it's really very simple <pause dur="short"/> you do the same pattern of</u>
<u n="429" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="430" who="S0019">actions every single time <pause dur="short"/> and the more you do that the more you will get used to it and become automatic</u>
<u n="431" who="S0018">hm <pause dur="short"/> I just why don't people just have automatic cars?</u>
<u n="432" who="S0019"><trunc>Y</trunc> well yes</u>

<u n="435" who="S0018">right <pause dur="short"/> honestly <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="436" who="S0019">automatic cars are fine <pause dur="short"/> except if you take your test on an automatic car you cannot drive a manual</u>
<u n="437" who="S0018">I know <pause dur="short"/> but why aren't all</u>
<u n="438" who="S0019">gearbox</u>
<u n="439" who="S0018">but why aren't all cars just automatic? Why because dad said what was it he said the last time? Oh I know but you'll you'll learn to appreciate a manual gearbox <pause dur="short"/> it's like why?</u>
<u n="440" who="S0019">pardon?</u>
<u n="441" who="S0018">it just complicates everything</u>
<u n="442" who="S0019">well it yes it does <pause dur="short"/> I mean we had an automatic <pause dur="short"/> and I had to stick my left foot underneath my seat</u>
<u n="443" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="466" who="S0019">so that there wasn't anything er likely to <vocal desc="laugh"/> come up and hit you <pause dur="short"/> actually I don't know where the the largest open space would be <pause dur="short"/> when I was learning there was um tut disused airfield <pause dur="short"/> can't remember where it was now <pause dur="short"/> but to start with I went on this disused airfield and just</u>

<u n="474" who="S0018">I also it's also natural for me for some reason <pause dur="short"/> when I'm turning like for example there's a junction no there's a road</u>
<u n="475" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="476" who="S0018">with a right-hand turn that is a T-junction <pause dur="short"/> so I'm turning right</u>

<u n="496" who="S0018">I just like I just take it fast <pause dur="short"/> I think it's because the faster you go because I'm not so comfortable with steering I'm worried about oversteering all the time <pause dur="short"/> so it maybe the faster I go on a turn the more it turns</u>

<u n="515" who="S0019">mm <pause dur="short"/> well if you want to really learn the gearbox then the best thing you can do is to sit in my car without the engine on and practise depressing the clutch and finding the gears</u>
<u n="516" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="517" who="S0019">Cos once you've done that it then becomes just automatic</u>

<u n="520" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="521" who="S0019">and even now sometimes um going from where are we? Second to third I sometimes overcook it and go straight to fifth</u>

<u n="523" who="S0019">no</u>
<u n="524" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos you see that's why I couldn't  I couldn't  find third</u>
<u n="525" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="526" who="S0018">I'm fine changing from first into second</u>
<u n="527" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="528" who="S0018">second into first and neutral</u>
<u n="529" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="530" who="S0018">but I was either going into first or fifth</u>
<u n="531" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="532" who="S0018">instead of third</u>
<u n="533" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="534" who="S0018">Cos the notch just didn't seem like it was</u>
<u n="535" who="S0019">mm</u>
<u n="536" who="S0018">there <pause dur="short"/> is it</u>
<u n="537" who="S0019">no you just have to learn where it is</u>
<u n="538" who="S0018">is it generally the same in every car?</u>
<u n="539" who="S0019">mhm <pause dur="short"/> the gearbox um</u>
<u n="540" who="S0018">no</u>
<u n="541" who="S0019">is the same pattern</u>
<u n="542" who="S0018">but the amount not the pattern like</u>
<u n="543" who="S0019">no no no no</u>
<u n="544" who="S0018">the distance between</u>
<u n="545" who="S0019">no <pause dur="short"/> er every car is slightly different <pause dur="short"/> um but once you've done it a few times you get to know and you can feel where it is</u>
<u n="546" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="547" who="S0019">most of the time <pause dur="short"/> so again it's just getting used to it</u>
<u n="548" who="S0018">yes <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure I will</u>
<u n="549" who="S0019">very interesting to watch people changing gear</u>
<u n="550" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="551" who="S0019">to see how they do it <pause dur="short"/> because your father if you watch him he's got a very circular</u>

<u n="560" who="S0018">yes <pause dur="short"/> it's just practice I guess isn't it</u>
<u n="561" who="S0019">and strangely enough if I have to think about the gearbox and where everything is that's really hard</u>
<u n="562" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="563" who="S0019">yeah <pause dur="short"/> if I sit in the car and do it it's just automatically there</u>
<u n="564" who="S0018">well that's like when you're trying to remember a phone number <pause dur="short"/> it's always easier to</u>
<u n="565" who="S0019">mm</u>

<u n="758" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="759" who="S0019">we'll just have to see what she comes up with</u>

<u n="1280" who="S0018">it's a surely that's a human instinct?</u>

<u n="1294" who="S0018">okay yeah <pause dur="short"/> dead bodies <pause dur="short"/> but it doesn't involve manpower <pause dur="short"/> it involves more technological</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0019">it's a much more even mix now than it ever was <pause dur="short"/> but it still involves manpower <pause dur="short"/> I mean</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0018">but I doubt they'd have to <trunc>cons</trunc> to use conscription</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0019">they would</u>

<u n="1306" who="S0018">yeah but nowadays with a war it would just be one nuclear bomb <pause dur="short"/> see you England</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0019">no no no no no <pause dur="short"/> I have grave doubts as to whether anybody would use a <trunc>nuc</trunc> the nuclear option because of the repercussions</u>

<u n="1309" who="S0019">I think it's nuclear weapons are a lot of sabre-rattling <pause dur="short"/> but I think it would have to be a real megalomaniac to actually use them</u>
