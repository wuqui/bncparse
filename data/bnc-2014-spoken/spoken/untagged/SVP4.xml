<u n="61" who="S0517">mm</u>
<u n="62" who="S0571">he doesn't seem to enjoy coaching anyway though does he?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0517">no he doesn't</u>
<u n="64" who="S0571">is he a good coach when he does coach?</u>
<u n="65" who="S0570">yeah well he he knows enough doesn't he because he just relays information that he's been told over the years doesn't he?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0517">he's had a lot of information given to him</u>
<u n="67" who="S0570">quite he's bright isn't he? so</u>
<u n="68" who="S0517">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0571">does he do more technical coaching than you do do you think?</u>
<u n="70" who="S0570">it's hard to do technical coaching in a group session</u>
<u n="71" who="S0517">is that why they don't do it?</u>
<u n="72" who="S0570">yeah cos you can't really</u>
<u n="73" who="S0517">well why not? why can't they like line everyone up and and make them serve and tell them what they're doing wrong?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0570">cos when you're lined up waiting for your someone to serve one by one and there's nine of you in the group you have to wait at least nine minutes</u>
<u n="75" who="S0517">I know but well that's what annoys me about</u>
<u n="76" who="S0570" trans="overlap">that's why they do that's why it's tactical</u>
<u n="77" who="S0517" trans="overlap">the academy it's not</u>
<u n="78" who="S0570" trans="overlap">well they can't they physically can't really do it unless unless you put them all just into matches and you go round one by one and pick something out</u>
<u n="79" who="S0571">see what I don't understand though is that you you you can do drills in groups can't you?</u>
<u n="80" who="S0570">yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0571">yeah so why can't one person be doing some drills and just the other person take people aside for ten minutes just to say look</u>
<u n="82" who="S0570"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="83" who="S0571">this isn't quite right I'd really like you to work on this this and this</u>
<u n="84" who="S0570">what so?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0517">yeah I I yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0570">no cos you don't do drills for long enough drills last five ten minutes</u>
<u n="87" who="S0571">alright well it</u>
<u n="88" who="S0517">oh it's just when you're doing hitting at the end why not take one person aside and say okay?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0570">cos you don't have time to do everything</u>
<u n="90" who="S0517">and and that's that's what</u>
<u n="91" who="S0571" trans="overlap">but you <trunc>cou</trunc> you could do half if if you've got the same but you've got if you've got people in a course for I dunno six weeks or eight weeks term yeah?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0570">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0571">well in that term if you've got twelve</u>
<u n="94" who="S0517" trans="overlap">I've had loads of wine</u>
<u n="95" who="S0571">if you've</u>
<u n="96" who="S0517" trans="overlap">I'm gonna not <trunc>ha</trunc> I'm gonna have a headache tomorrow</u>
<u n="97" who="S0571">if you've got twelve people in the group why can't they just identify two people each lesson and say right in this lesson we're gonna focus on these two and the rest we're just gonna continue doing generic stuff with but they'll have other stuff that they've been thinking about</u>
<u n="98" who="S0570">well I think the big difference is which is what me and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> don't get is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> always says when people go to do their serves and stuff they've all been told specifics of because the academy's not just a squad is it? you've got a fitness part of it you've got your tactical part which is the squad</u>
<u n="99" who="S0517">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0570">and you've got your technical part which is the lesson</u>
<u n="101" who="S0517">oh</u>
<u n="102" who="S0570">so he</u>
<u n="103" who="S0517" trans="overlap">so you're not getting and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="104" who="S0570" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0517">is getting one out of the three</u>
<u n="106" who="S0570">so <trunc>ha</trunc> <trunc>ni</trunc>ninety per cent of them have been told technical stuff to work on</u>
<u n="107" who="S0517">okay</u>
<u n="108" who="S0570" trans="overlap">already which is why it doesn't happen</u>
<u n="109" who="S0517" trans="overlap">so out of the</u>
<u n="110" who="S0570" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="111" who="S0517">people in the academy how many are doing all three?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0570">well most of them are doing all three and if they're not doing all three they're averaging at least one a month of a private lesson</u>
<u n="113" who="S0517">so it's only you two <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> for instance <trunc>is</trunc>isn't doing anything he's not done the fitness or the private lessons</u>
<u n="114" who="S0570">so he's just doing the tactical</u>
<u n="115" who="S0517">oh okay</u>
<u n="116" who="S0571">but I I I think that tactical is a load of rubbish I really do</u>
<u n="117" who="S0517" trans="overlap">yeah I think you'd you you'd benefit from the technical private lesson</u>
<u n="118" who="S0571" trans="overlap">because</u>
<u n="119" who="S0517" trans="overlap">over the tactical</u>
<u n="120" who="S0571">the <trunc>ta</trunc></u>
<u n="121" who="S0570">I've said that all along but I dunno why you're telling me</u>
<u n="122" who="S0517" trans="overlap">I know well we I know I know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="123" who="S0571" trans="overlap">doesn't make any difference telling me</u>
<u n="124" who="S0517" trans="overlap">we didn't manage to get out of it did we? but</u>
<u n="125" who="S0571" trans="overlap">but even when you spoke to him we we left it down to you to tell him and he you had a chat with him and he <trunc>tur</trunc> he talked you round didn't he?</u>
<u n="126" who="S0517" trans="overlap">who?</u>
<u n="127" who="S0571"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="128" who="S0517"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="129" who="S0570">what the squad?</u>
<u n="130" who="S0571">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0570" trans="overlap">that's because I I</u>
<u n="132" who="S0517">he talked us round <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="133" who="S0570" trans="overlap">in</u>
<u n="134" who="S0517">so you can't have a go at him</u>
<u n="135" who="S0570" trans="overlap">in the squad I</u>
<u n="136" who="S0517" trans="overlap">he talked us round</u>
<u n="137" who="S0570">in the <trunc>s</trunc> after saying he quitted the only person I hit with in that squad was with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="138" who="S0517">quit is the past tense</u>
<u n="139" who="S0570" trans="overlap">so</u>
<u n="140" who="S0517">of quit</u>
<u n="141" who="S0570">there was no reason not to <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="142" who="S0517">quit</u>
<u n="143" who="S0570">and then</u>
<u n="144" who="S0517" trans="overlap">got it?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0570">everyone dropped out so it ended up being a lesson anyway so it was a win win for us and</u>
<u n="146" who="S0571" trans="overlap">oh so it has been good for you?</u>
<u n="147" who="S0570">well I then <trunc>di</trunc> I'm doing the five lessons anyway</u>
<u n="148" who="S0517" trans="overlap">this has on the Tuesday now when I said to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he can't do this because of his exams and his revision and his <trunc>ac</trunc></u>
