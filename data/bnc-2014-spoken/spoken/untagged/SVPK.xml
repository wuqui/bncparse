<u n="1" who="S0444">that would be my point cos it's just a point of principle that I don't really wanna take the job search too far</u>
<u n="2" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="3" who="S0444">while I'm not on full hours because I just don't think that's <unclear/> application</u>
<u n="4" who="S0439">oh no of course not no</u>
<u n="5" who="S0444">and I know a lot of people would apply <pause dur="short"/> and be like I'm ill but who cares but er from both sides apart I don't wanna apply to a company when I'm still poorly and achieve <unclear/></u>
<u n="6" who="S0439">and also you kind of don't wanna turn <pause dur="short"/> not turn your back on <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> but you don't wanna be like oh you've supported me through my illness and now <trunc>y</trunc></u>
<u n="7" who="S0444">and now I'm fucking off</u>
<u n="8" who="S0439">now I'm pissing off yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0444">or I've used that tack you'd never want it to be the case that they'd turn round and be like oh but you were on sick leave then but were you that sick?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0439">yeah exactly yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0444">if you could search for job and that's not</u>
<u n="12" who="S0439">you don't wanna damage your relationship with <anon type="name" nameType="n"/></u>
<u n="13" who="S0444">and also don't want it to be the case where they think oh we moved you from a certain subject to another one and you weren't happy so you've now left and it's kind of like well <pause dur="short"/> yeah it it doesn't look great</u>
<u n="14" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="15" who="S0444">but I'm just like you know what?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0439">but after six eight months I think that's probably fine</u>
<u n="17" who="S0444">yeah I mean that's the thing like the hospital treatment is like the first batch of it is pretty much coming to an end erm and then they're going to reassess and see what more <unclear/></u>
<u n="18" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0444">cos the problem is that everyone else in the <unclear/> that I've been going to has been receiving lots of extra help from their doctors and their GPs or other hospitals</u>
<u n="20" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0444">so I haven't had anything <pause dur="short"/> like my doctor er you know nobody has been telling me how many hours to do</u>
<u n="22" who="S0439">mm</u>
<u n="23" who="S0444">and what is good and what is bad and what to look out for nobody</u>
<u n="24" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0444">I've been trying to dictate all of this myself and I could've got it completely wrong in some in fact in some ways I think I have erm which is why I'm struggling with <unclear>this problem</unclear></u>
<u n="26" who="S0439">but if you've never <trunc>bee</trunc> you've never been through this before <pause dur="short"/> like you <trunc>canno</trunc> well obviously not in a work environment so</u>
<u n="27" who="S0444" trans="overlap">no not in a working context <pause dur="short"/> and that's the thing and <pause dur="short"/> when I went to the when I talked to the specialist they were like what? you mean you've had no help? and I was like no the GP just said that you guys would sort me out with this <unclear/> they were like oh right at the end of the like you know the three appointment programme well we'll have to sit down and review what you're doing cos a lot of the people in the clinic it is really <pause dur="short"/> it's it is quite depressing in a way but they are all off work or chosen not to work or you know they they they can't walk more than ten minutes and <unclear>I'm going you know it's terrible</unclear> <unclear/> but like you know and <pause dur="short"/> some of them are bed bound and some of them go to a doctor's appointment and that's it they're laid up for a week and er <pause dur="short"/> you know it is quite extreme</u>
<u n="28" who="S0439">mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0444">I'm not I've not ever been that bad that one appointment is enough to set me off but also</u>
<u n="30" who="S0439">but also <pause dur="short"/> I think the <trunc>dist</trunc> the difference between you is that you're driven and you don't <pause dur="short"/> you don't use this illness as an excuse</u>
<u n="31" who="S0444">no and it just <vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="32" who="S0439">for you to <trunc>n</trunc> like get out of things cos I think I think some people would take this as like</u>
<u n="33" who="S0444">no I think</u>
<u n="34" who="S0439">take this opportunity to be like oh I need this much time off work because I've got chronic fatigue syndrome or like</u>
<u n="35" who="S0444">I miss being at work I miss</u>
<u n="36" who="S0439">yeah exactly I think you've <trunc>mi</trunc></u>
<u n="37" who="S0444">I miss being at work and I miss being able to <unclear/> and be spontaneous</u>
<u n="38" who="S0439">you've got that drive</u>
<u n="39" who="S0444">and that's what I've missed and that's what I'm starting to get back now</u>
<u n="40" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0444">is getting that bit of drive so me looking at stuff like you know I've had my inbox <pause dur="short"/> I've er got a separate inbox for it piling up of all the industry news and analysis and research</u>
<u n="42" who="S0439">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0444">and stuff that I find interesting</u>
<u n="44" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0444">and would use in <trunc>in</trunc> er like in interviews and things like that that's all been piling up and for the first time like in months this week I actually started to look through it</u>
<u n="46" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0444">and started to make notes and er and that's me starting to get that drive back and I was like oh I'm gonna go you know and I'm going on a lot of training courses over the next couple of weeks which should be quite good</u>
<u n="48" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0444"><unclear>and it helps</unclear> cos you know I've still got that question of do I want to be in marketing?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0444">is it marketing but not in a publishing industry? or is it definitely publishing that I wanna be in? but maybe not marketing</u>
<u n="52" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0444">or is it publishing but just not <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> like</u>
<u n="54" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0444">I don't know whether you can really like <pause dur="short"/> isolate the different things but I sense like er I've noticed some of the girls yesterday I just said you know cos they were asking about like the house and stuff and how that was going and I was kind of like well you know it's it it's kind of starting to run its natural course like</u>
<u n="56" who="S0439">mm</u>

<u n="60" who="S0439">mm</u>
<u n="61" who="S0444">but actually <unclear>in the sense that</unclear> oh maybe I can do this cos you know it's starting to <pause dur="short"/> you know I could start to function a bit more I've <trunc>starte</trunc> I've had a holiday</u>
<u n="62" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="63" who="S0444">I'm able to have a holiday I'm able to see my friends yay</u>
<u n="64" who="S0439">and like living with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was always like it's nice and convenient and good price and stuff but it hasn't really been able to give you the freedom of living on your own</u>
<u n="65" who="S0444">no</u>
<u n="66" who="S0439">or having your own space</u>
<u n="67" who="S0444">well put it this way</u>
