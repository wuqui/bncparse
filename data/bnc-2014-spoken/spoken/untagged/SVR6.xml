<u n="164" who="S0084">oh good</u>
<u n="165" who="S0135">on the way back however they shut Dartford er Tunnel <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="166" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="167" who="S0135">what bit do you er yeah you it's the Dartford Tunnel they shut <pause dur="short"/> so we could still go over going back towards <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="168" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="169" who="S0135">but you couldn't sort of come in <pause dur="short"/> um but they diverted everyone off into Essex <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="170" who="S0084">shit</u>
<u n="171" who="S0135">on my way on the M25 towards this Dartford Crossing</u>

<u n="182" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="183" who="S0135">um <pause dur="short"/> and then you had the option once you'd sort of gone down this ramp to get back onto the M25</u>
<u n="184" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="185" who="S0135">to continue to the Dartford Tunnel</u>
<u n="186" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="187" who="S0135">but that entrance was blocked off as well by like police vehicles <pause dur="short"/> and because I was like I'm not gonna go into Essex <pause dur="short"/> so I literally just went round the roundabout until they opened up the um</u>

<u n="281" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="282" who="S0084">and I didn't hear from him <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>f</trunc> he was like I've gotta wait for this guy to pay me for a job <pause dur="short"/> but I'll be over</u>

<u n="1827" who="S0135">Libya <pause dur="short"/> libya <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that kind of thing <pause dur="short"/> because you'd have the Foreign Office there checking everyone's sort of passports and their eligibility to board the vessel and that kind of thing</u>
