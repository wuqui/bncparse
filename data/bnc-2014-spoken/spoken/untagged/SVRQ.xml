<u n="149" who="S0152">just the thought of building <pause dur="short"/> you know I know they have to build it but just the thought of building that engine and you know you know <pause dur="short"/> will it be <pause dur="short"/> you know I was thinking will it will it be will it be the same engine or will it be like a new engine like the new version of the engine</u>

<u n="820" who="S0152">you know</u>
<u n="821" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="822" who="S0152">and it was interesting because I heard I heard the <trunc>conversa</trunc> I did hear the conversation cos I'd er <pause dur="short"/> had a student who had misbehaved on Thursday a year seven student <pause dur="short"/> and I'd asked my line manager what are we gonna do with him? because everything's in limbo at the moment</u>
<u n="823" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="824" who="S0152">because we don't know what the consequences are gonna be because in the old regime it was if this happened they were in there for the day</u>
<u n="825" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="826" who="S0152">type thing er <pause dur="short"/> if and she doesn't want that she wants it a little different so I got this message to email her and I thought am I putting myself in the middle here?</u>
<u n="827" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="828" who="S0152">am I putting myself in the middle? but the message was from my line manager and another person was he said you need to email and see what she says so I emailed the boss and she came back to me because she wasn't in the academy and came back and went see me in the morning and we'll have a have a chat</u>
<u n="829" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="830" who="S0152">so I went in one in the morning</u>
<u n="831" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="832" who="S0152">and just and we had this chat and she went right <pause dur="short"/> what do you do and I explained I said it had been going on quite a lot of the day from the statements which we've taken <pause dur="short"/> I said she says right we'll have him as an internal exclusion internal inclusion erm <pause dur="short"/> but make certain it goes on the records that <unclear>it's that</unclear> but we'll put him in the time out room because we we can't do <unclear>him</unclear> over in the hub because a person just broke his collarbone</u>
<u n="833" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="834" who="S0152">a little girl <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> okay no problem <pause dur="short"/> and then I said I'd go and get him and when I went to get him she made this phone call and I heard the phone call basically so that she was negotiating what they could do and what they couldn't do when they came in</u>
<u n="835" who="S0012" trans="overlap">oh I see</u>
<u n="836" who="S0152">erm</u>
<u n="837" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="838" who="S0152">which was which was interesting and then I spoke to a member of staff later in the day and it was like I don't know who she thinks she is</u>
<u n="839" who="S0012" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="840" who="S0152">well she's the principal she's the principal of this the academy she can do what she wants</u>
<u n="841" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="842" who="S0152">be but the problem she's having <pause dur="short"/> is <pause dur="short"/> when you when you're a head or principal of your own school</u>
<u n="843" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="844" who="S0152">it is different to being principal or head in a federation because the federation has rules</u>
<u n="845" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="846" who="S0152">of what we can and can't do where so if you need to do <trunc>so</trunc> if you need to do something you need to inform the federation that you're gonna do this</u>
<u n="847" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="848" who="S0152">but then that's a big stepping stone</u>
<u n="849" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="850" who="S0152">because you've got to keep checking</u>
<u n="851" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="852" who="S0152">and the <trunc>federa</trunc> I'm sure what I was told is the federation says if they if the press are coming in you've got to let every <trunc>mem</trunc> every student's parents know</u>
<u n="853" who="S0012" trans="overlap">know</u>
<u n="854" who="S0152">they're coming in</u>
<u n="855" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="856" who="S0013" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="857" who="S0152">so that they can say nay or yay to them</u>
<u n="858" who="S0012" trans="overlap">being filmed</u>
<u n="859" who="S0152">being filmed or whatever</u>
<u n="860" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="861" who="S0152">now we we have on record everybody's consent to say yes we can no we can't</u>
<u n="862" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="863" who="S0152">but if you're a a student and it's like</u>
<u n="864" who="S0012" trans="overlap">well yeah</u>
<u n="865" who="S0152">you know oh yeah I want to be on TV and you parents said no</u>
<u n="866" who="S0012" trans="overlap">you do it</u>
<u n="867" who="S0152">you do it I mean I had a a problem when I was <unclear/> student his parents had says he couldn't have his picture taken</u>
<u n="868" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="869" who="S0152">and it was a whole school photo and he wanted he wanted to be in it</u>
<u n="870" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="871" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="872" who="S0152">and his parents said he couldn't and then he he asked me could you phone up and say what it is and I went yeah of course I can if that's what you want so I phoned up and they were like well what is it I said it's a whole school photo and he would like to be in it with all his</u>
<u n="873" who="S0012" trans="overlap">mates yeah</u>
<u n="874" who="S0152">with all his mates and it was like oh what's it gonna be used for I says it's not going to be used for anything it's</u>
<u n="875" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="876" who="S0152">it is a whole school photo</u>
<u n="877" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="878" who="S0152">you know and the problem is knowing some of the parents they don't want the pictures taken because if their son or daughter does something wrong you've got an image of them saying who it is</u>
<u n="879" who="S0012">yeah of course of course</u>
<u n="880" who="S0152">and that and that's another little factor that comes into play</u>
<u n="881" who="S0012">I think erm <unclear/></u>
<u n="882" who="S0013"><unclear/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="883" who="S0012">I think <unclear/> but when they <pause dur="short"/> I don't think <unclear/> they had erm they filmed the kids in the playground and all you can see is their legs</u>
<u n="884" who="S0152" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="885" who="S0012">they don't show any faces or anything do they or if they're a little more away they're blur them it's a blur</u>
<u n="886" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="887" who="S0012">it never used to be like that did it?</u>
<u n="888" who="S0013">no</u>
<u n="889" who="S0152">no it's just</u>
<u n="890" who="S0012">I mean when when they that that seems ridiculous to me what what what's the difference between you know seeing kids playing in the playground and filming the kids playing in the playground?</u>
<u n="891" who="S0152">because there are some kids that have been moved schools and they're in safe houses et cetera</u>
<u n="892" who="S0013">oh yeah</u>
<u n="893" who="S0012"><unclear/></u>
<u n="894" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="895" who="S0152">and if their and if from whoever they're put in the safe house from sees them on TV</u>
<u n="896" who="S0013">oh</u>
<u n="897" who="S0152">they'll know where they are</u>
<u n="898" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="899" who="S0152">and they go and hang outside</u>
<u n="900" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="901" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="902" who="S0012">isn't it a shame how things have changed though? <pause dur="short"/> I mean that was quite some time ago when they decided that erm you couldn't film your kids that at the nativity</u>
<u n="903" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="904" who="S0012">and they decided that was fine at the end though</u>
<u n="905" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="906" who="S0012">well we were we filmed our kids at the nativity</u>
<u n="907" who="S0152">yeah I mean I think I think one person if I remember rightly on person in the school kicked up about it one person</u>
<u n="908" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="909" who="S0152">and it was only one and because one person kicks up then because the way that headteacher was <unclear/> and knew what was going on with the press she went no blanket no</u>
<u n="910" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="911" who="S0152">no but in the then she actually I think she then some sort of guidance came out from the unions in little bits and pieces which says you know you make it clear that they can film it</u>
<u n="912" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="913" who="S0152">but they're only filming their child or whatever it is</u>
<u n="914" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="915" who="S0152">erm and if and if they don't and if the child can't be filmed then you don't put them in play</u>
<u n="916" who="S0012">yeah that makes sense</u>
<u n="917" who="S0152">why stop if for the majority</u>
<u n="918" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="919" who="S0152">because of one person</u>
<u n="920" who="S0012">yeah course I mean people are so proud of they're so proud of seeing their kids on stage doing their bit and then some idiot will say oh no not not <unclear/></u>
<u n="921" who="S0152" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="922" who="S0012">they spoil it for the entire crowd</u>
<u n="923" who="S0152">that's what it comes down to</u>
<u n="924" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="925" who="S0152">that's what it literally comes down to</u>
<u n="926" who="S0013">so was the reason that these parents didn't want their son being photographed?</u>
<u n="927" who="S0152">well it was because he was always in trouble</u>
<u n="928" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="929" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="930" who="S0152">he was always in trouble and there was one there was one case where we did actually manage to get a picture cos we hadn't got we hadn't got picture of a couple of students who'd done something</u>
<u n="931" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="932" who="S0152">and we the head of PE did some filming intentionally</u>
<u n="933" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="934" who="S0152">intentionally too and they got the picture and then of course we can't use them because we didn't have permission</u>
<u n="935" who="S0012">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="936" who="S0152">yeah little things like that we just have deal with so</u>
<u n="937" who="S0012">yeah we do yeah</u>
<u n="938" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="939" who="S0012">that's such a shame though</u>
<u n="940" who="S0152">we just have to deal with</u>
<u n="941" who="S0012">I mean parents some parents are <unclear/> the way they rant and rave</u>
<u n="942" who="S0152">yeah some but we've I meant this week's been a it's a the hardest week again this week</u>
<u n="943" who="S0012">has it?</u>
<u n="944" who="S0152">oh yeah with <trunc>ev</trunc> with everything that's been going on this week it's been the hardest week so</u>
<u n="945" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="946" who="S0012">I suppose it becomes harder as the terms goes on doesn't it because they're thinking it will be half-term it will soon full-term or whatever</u>
<u n="947" who="S0152">well last week we were told that we've got to deliver a different course for our uni's</u>
<u n="948" who="S0012" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="949" who="S0152">right starting three weeks' time</u>

<u n="954" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="955" who="S0152">et cetera et cetera</u>
<u n="956" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="957" who="S0152">three weeks <pause dur="short"/> and it's not just for year it will be for two years</u>
<u n="958" who="S0012">oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="959" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="960" who="S0152">because we're thinking the timetable might change</u>
<u n="961" who="S0012">well what about the curriculum? does that</u>
<u n="962" who="S0152">it will affect it will affect</u>
<u n="963" who="S0012" trans="overlap">it will affect the whole curriculum</u>
<u n="964" who="S0152">yeah it will affect it yeah but it will also affect all year nine students</u>
<u n="965" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="966" who="S0152">because what they're gonna make them do is a DT subject</u>
<u n="967" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="968" who="S0152">well not all students at year nine want to do a DT subject</u>
<u n="969" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="970" who="S0152">they want to get out of it they don't want to do it</u>
<u n="971" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="972" who="S0152">they've had enough of it</u>
<u n="973" who="S0012">sure</u>
<u n="974" who="S0152">but they're all gonna have to do it <pause dur="short"/> right and this is the year group that wasn't allowed to pick its options last year in year eight to go into year nine because the school had gone back to a traditional way of picking</u>
<u n="975" who="S0012">oh I see yeah</u>
<u n="976" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="977" who="S0152">right</u>
<u n="978" who="S0012">so there will be some disruption there</u>
<u n="979" who="S0152">right so and because the new principal had used this course at her old school which was relatively successful <vocal desc="laugh"/> which is back to two worth two GCSE's <vocal desc="cough"/> you know</u>
<u n="980" who="S0012" trans="overlap">oh I see yeah</u>
<u n="981" who="S0152">doesn't personally yes it's a it's a qualification point that has no meaning</u>
<u n="982" who="S0012" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="983" who="S0152">but it gets you on the league table and gets the students</u>
<u n="984" who="S0012">yes it's a bit <unclear/> this league table isn't it? there used to be some some courses you could take and they were <unclear/></u>
<u n="985" who="S0152">yes well the government stopped that you see</u>
<u n="986" who="S0012">they stopped that did they?</u>
<u n="987" who="S0152">yeah because what was happening when that came in you could have that once course for four then picked up another one and you've got your five GCSE's</u>
<u n="988" who="S0012" trans="overlap">five GSCE yeah</u>
<u n="989" who="S0152">so you stand you</u>
<u n="990" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="991" who="S0152">you was high in the standards you were in the top because that's how <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> used to do it</u>
<u n="992" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="993" who="S0152">and then the government got onto the back of that and went no you've got to have five GCSE's and including English and Maths</u>
<u n="994" who="S0012">yes yeah yeah</u>
<u n="995" who="S0152">so that would become the gold standards</u>
<u n="996" who="S0012">you must you must get it in English and Maths</u>
