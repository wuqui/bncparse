<u n="320" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="321" who="S0008">and then but as soon as the conservatives come in bang twenty percent</u>
<u n="322" who="S0013">yeah</u>

<u n="334" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="335" who="S0008">but they've got to get the money from somewhere</u>
<u n="336" who="S0012">course they have yeah</u>

<u n="338" who="S0012">well they got to really haven't they?</u>
<u n="339" who="S0008">and er the thing about revaluation all it is I mean they shouldn't it shouldn't make any difference to how much you pay unless you know you're living in a house which was undervalued</u>

<u n="341" who="S0008">cos it should be the same but it doesn't work like that does it?</u>
<u n="342" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="343" who="S0008">like everyone then suddenly starts paying fifty quid a year more</u>

<u n="354" who="S0012">that was in <unclear/> it's five hundred pound each now or? you know</u>
<u n="355" who="S0013">yeah but that's how it was and everyone moaned and moaned about it and then they went back to housing tax</u>
<u n="356" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="357" who="S0008">well that's right</u>
<u n="358" who="S0013" trans="overlap">or whatever they call council tax now</u>
<u n="359" who="S0008">council tax I mean they use</u>
<u n="360" who="S0013" trans="overlap">and they keep <unclear/></u>
<u n="361" who="S0008">it used to be like your council or what they called</u>
<u n="362" who="S0012">rates</u>
<u n="363" who="S0008">the rates used to be about you know two hundred and fifty quid a year</u>
<u n="364" who="S0012">yeah that's it yeah</u>
<u n="365" who="S0008">and then conservatives said oh no well we got to change that to like eight hundred quid a year</u>
<u n="366" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="367" who="S0008">and they put up VAT from fifteen to seventeen and a half percent at the same time</u>
<u n="368" who="S0012">they did yeah</u>
<u n="369" who="S0008">to pay for the difference so you ended up paying a fortune</u>
<u n="370" who="S0013">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="371" who="S0012">yeah I think it was worked out long long ago I can't remember that if you actually spend one pound I think ninety percent of that one pound is taxed in one way or another</u>
<u n="372" who="S0008">yeah I'm sure it is cos I mean you pay income tax for a start before you start spending</u>
<u n="373" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="374" who="S0012">then you pay twenty percent on your if if you went and bought a bottle of pop</u>
<u n="375" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="376" who="S0012">and that's that's twenty percent more you know?</u>
<u n="377" who="S0008">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="378" who="S0012">and a bottle of pop costs you about fifty pence more</u>
<u n="379" who="S0008">but you see you wouldn't you wouldn't you know be so worried about you know paying for it you know tax if that was used in a proper manner</u>
<u n="380" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="381" who="S0008">everyone needs you know like infrastructure don't they?</u>
<u n="382" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="383" who="S0008">like roads being built people are quick enough to moan when there's potholes and stuff but someone's got to pay for it</u>
<u n="384" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="385" who="S0013">yeah and that's only fair</u>
<u n="386" who="S0012" trans="overlap">so this is what road tax was about wasn't it?</u>
<u n="387" who="S0008">well it started off that way</u>
<u n="388" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="389" who="S0008">it isn't like that any more</u>
<u n="390" who="S0012">not any more no</u>
<u n="391" who="S0008">just goes into the the general exchequer but I mean you know that's happens so often but then you know they're talking about a thousand billion pounds</u>
<u n="392" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="393" who="S0008">is what <unclear/> is going to cost us in the next twenty years</u>
<u n="394" who="S0012">and we are</u>
<u n="395" who="S0008">and they say they say well it's not much it's over twenty years so it's only whatever it is so many billion a year and you think well what</u>
<u n="396" who="S0012">we already owe over a trillion</u>
<u n="397" who="S0008">but what you could do with all that money</u>
<u n="398" who="S0013" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="399" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="400" who="S0008">if</u>
<u n="401" who="S0012">look at the hospitals and schools you could have for a start</u>
<u n="402" who="S0008">well that's right and they <trunc>s</trunc> talk about the you know</u>
<u n="403" who="S0012" trans="overlap">and the nurses and doctors</u>
<u n="404" who="S0008">on a as a much lower level it's a high-speed two railway line</u>
<u n="405" who="S0012">oh yeah</u>
<u n="406" who="S0008">that's got a projected cost of four billion or something</u>
<u n="407" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="408" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="409" who="S0008">and you think gosh if that money if that was spent differently</u>
<u n="410" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="411" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="412" who="S0013">we don't need that do we?</u>
<u n="413" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah no why would I want to get from London to Birmingham in in three minutes or something stupid</u>
<u n="414" who="S0013" trans="overlap">it's not needed</u>
<u n="415" who="S0008">but they then they say about housing they say well you know it's the cost of land you think well they put that railway line in they think nothing about compulsory purchase on the land</u>
<u n="416" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="417" who="S0008">and they'll be paying like you know agricultural rates for it</u>
<u n="418" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="419" who="S0008">why they can't use that money to buy compulsory purchase land for housing</u>
<u n="420" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="421" who="S0008">cos you build a house I mean a hundred and fifty thousand of it is the cost of the plot innit?</u>
<u n="422" who="S0012">yeah it is yeah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0008">you know so you can't build cheap houses if you're starting off</u>
<u n="424" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="425" who="S0008">but then if the council's bought the land cheap you know so they plot is only you know if you call it agriculture land what is it three thousand and acre or something</u>
<u n="426" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="427" who="S0008">or five thousand an acre</u>
<u n="428" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="429" who="S0008">and you split that up into plots each plot is only going to cost you a few hundred quid innit?</u>
<u n="430" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="431" who="S0008">so if they started off with a few hundred quid rather than a hundred and fifty thousand</u>
<u n="432" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="433" who="S0008">for a plot the house comes out</u>
<u n="434" who="S0013">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="435" who="S0008">you know that much cheaper</u>
<u n="436" who="S0012">yeah if you think how much a plot is now and how much a plot is when our parents bought their house</u>
<u n="437" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="438" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="439" who="S0012">land was next to nothing</u>
<u n="440" who="S0008">well that's right yeah but I mean you know I mean</u>
<u n="441" who="S0012">I know it's all relevant but I mean they had enough money then to buy</u>
<u n="442" who="S0008">yeah but I mean it's not <trunc>i</trunc> or did you mean it's all relative?</u>
<u n="443" who="S0012"><trunc>re</trunc>relative yeah</u>
<u n="444" who="S0008">but yeah but I mean in those days it was still cheap compared to how much people earned than it is nowadays I mean not the the cost of housing sort of escalated way above the cost of earnings</u>
<u n="445" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="446" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="447" who="S0012">in <anon type="place"/> where we lived there's a there was a building called <anon type="place"/> right? and there was a huge piece of land that stretch out</u>

<u n="450" who="S0008">is it? oh well well I'm sure I've had more than</u>

<u n="460" who="S0008">mm</u>
