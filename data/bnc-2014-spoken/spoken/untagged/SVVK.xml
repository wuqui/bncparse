<u n="1" who="S0320">so one of my issues with CLIL was the division of teachers and the division of work because</u>
<u n="2" who="S0322" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="3" who="S0320">erm <pause dur="short"/> ideally you'd have EFL teachers who are also subject teachers or you would train subject teachers</u>
<u n="4" who="S0322">to</u>
<u n="5" who="S0320" trans="overlap">be EFL teachers</u>
<u n="6" who="S0322" trans="overlap">which would probably be the easier way wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="7" who="S0320">exactly but then they're doing someone out of a job but according to him that wasn't that's not the way forward obviously cos his company's called <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="8" who="S0322" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="9" who="S0320">who run CLIL courses <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="10" who="S0322">yeah when I lived in Bali erm quite a a few people were getting jobs in international schools when they weren't the subject teacher</u>
<u n="11" who="S0320">oh</u>
<u n="12" who="S0322">er but they would have to teach for example biology</u>
<u n="13" who="S0320">mm yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0322" trans="overlap">and that's quite daunting to have to properly teach</u>
<u n="15" who="S0320">I can imagine</u>
<u n="16" who="S0322">a subject</u>
<u n="17" who="S0320">really boring as well by the sounds of it</u>
<u n="18" who="S0322">yeah well you do I think you just really want to know what you're doing but then again if you think of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that covers classes and she's just given material <vocal desc="laugh"/> and just goes and then</u>
<u n="19" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah that's true actually</u>
<u n="20" who="S0322">these days a lot of it is but for that kind of like the example he showed</u>
<u n="21" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="22" who="S0322">you'd need to know your subject</u>
<u n="23" who="S0320">but you wouldn't the example he showed</u>
<u n="24" who="S0322" trans="overlap">but couldn't you just</u>
<u n="25" who="S0320">was about a recording programme you could just learn that that would be easy</u>
<u n="26" who="S0322">you could be everything you taught them you'd have to learn first and it's quite hard work</u>
<u n="27" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm yeah that's true</u>
<u n="28" who="S0322" trans="overlap">to have to each yourself before you teach them</u>
<u n="29" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0322">erm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="32" who="S0322">I mean the most logical thing would be to actually use the subject teachers</u>
<u n="33" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="34" who="S0322">and just teach them how to TEFL <vocal desc="laugh"/> TEFL it up</u>
<u n="35" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah but quite a lot of them don't like it I think is one of the problems that they were facing anyway cos he had a few</u>
<u n="36" who="S0322" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0320" trans="overlap">like surveys that they'd done and the results and stuff like that so <vocal desc="laugh"/> one of the ones was was subject teachers don't think EFL teachers are proper teachers</u>
<u n="38" who="S0322">mm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0320">and that they stand in front of the class and explain everything whereas they don't elicit things it was it was interesting</u>
<u n="40" who="S0322">mm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0320" trans="overlap">and I think it will probably have a place in a classroom but I don't think in an adult private language school you could use it as the <trunc>wh</trunc> sole</u>
<u n="42" who="S0322" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="43" who="S0320">method</u>
<u n="44" who="S0322" trans="overlap">no because</u>
<u n="45" who="S0320" trans="overlap">I mean you can't use anything as a sole method can you?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0322" trans="overlap">if I was set work for the thing though but as I was saying if you've got say a token intermediate class</u>
<u n="47" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0322">and you've got a fifty-five-year-old businessman</u>
<u n="49" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="50" who="S0322">I couple of teenage I don't know</u>
<u n="51" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0322">well teenage but sort of seventeen eighteen and you've got I don't know a couple of <pause dur="short"/> guys from</u>
<u n="53" who="S0320" trans="overlap">very mixed</u>
<u n="54" who="S0322">Saudi Arabia</u>
<u n="55" who="S0320" trans="overlap">students yeah</u>
<u n="56" who="S0322">that are heading towards <unclear/></u>
<u n="57" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0322" trans="overlap">and you've got to find a topic</u>
<u n="59" who="S0320">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="60" who="S0322" trans="overlap">that they all want to invest that much</u>
<u n="61" who="S0320">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="62" who="S0322" trans="overlap">effort into when you've got the</u>
<u n="63" who="S0320" trans="overlap">and that they don't</u>
<u n="64" who="S0322" trans="overlap">kind of attitude of I've come to improve my grammar</u>
<u n="65" who="S0320" trans="overlap">and that they don't</u>
<u n="66" who="S0322" trans="overlap">or I've come to</u>
<u n="67" who="S0320" trans="overlap">already know</u>
<u n="68" who="S0322"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="69" who="S0320" trans="overlap">that's the thing with adults isn't it? with kids</u>
<u n="70" who="S0322" trans="overlap">it would have to be quite in depth wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0320" trans="overlap">it's a bit more predictable wouldn't it?</u>
<u n="72" who="S0322">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0320">so you would have an idea with kids from the curriculum that they've already set it for the first five years of their school or ten years you'd have a really clear idea of what</u>
<u n="74" who="S0322">yeah</u>
<u n="75" who="S0320">they will have been exposed</u>
<u n="76" who="S0322" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0320" trans="overlap">to whereas adults you wouldn't would you? but that's a good <unclear/></u>
<u n="78" who="S0322" trans="overlap">but the idea of just using <vocal desc="laugh"/> more interesting material or using stuff that you</u>
<u n="79" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0322">would learn <trunc>someth</trunc> cos that's quite exciting I find</u>
<u n="81" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0322">when I do something in class which is</u>
<u n="83" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0322">real</u>
<u n="85" who="S0320">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="86" who="S0322">and you go oh I didn't know that or use a piece of like a piece of literature or</u>
<u n="87" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0322">I mean a lot those those erm global books and things like that</u>
<u n="89" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0322">where you've got <pause dur="short"/> they seem to be more where you've got a really interesting topic</u>
<u n="91" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0322" trans="overlap">with some interesting information</u>
<u n="93" who="S0320">this is</u>
<u n="94" who="S0322">and then discuss it</u>
<u n="95" who="S0320">this was this CLIL book that I saw at at <anon type="place"/> but it was it <vocal desc="laugh"/> some of the <trunc>topi</trunc> it looked like it was designed for a sixth form so some of the</u>
<u n="96" who="S0322" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0320" trans="overlap">topics included erm <pause dur="short"/> what's your future job? do you want to work in a marijuana farm in Canada? erm Eminem modern day poet or blah</u>
<u n="98" who="S0322" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0320" trans="overlap">blasphemous? blah blah</u>

<u n="102" who="S0322">I think I I remember looking at a book which was very very</u>

<u n="112" who="S0322">mm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0320">that it just feels a bit silly using it but yeah it was interesting I liked the idea but my biggest issue I think I wrote some notes actually I wonder where erm I wrote them <pause dur="short"/> my biggest issue I think was what happens to the teachers <vocal desc="laugh"/> basically and one of my other questions which keeps coming up again and again and again oh no that's not relevant actually so <vocal desc="laugh"/> one of the things he did was he gave us this list of ways to represent information that state school teachers use all the time</u>
<u n="114" who="S0322">uhu</u>
<u n="115" who="S0320">and asked us to try and work out what <pause dur="short"/> what each of them were erm this was my favourite so this is this is a tree diagram this was my version of the <trunc>t</trunc> tree diagram</u>
<u n="116" who="S0322">yeah</u>

<u n="170" who="S0322">yeah</u>
<u n="171" who="S0320" trans="overlap">I quite liked my illustration</u>
<u n="172" who="S0322" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="173" who="S0320">I thought it was good</u>
<u n="174" who="S0322" trans="overlap">interesting that this while top down bottom up seems to be used in lots of different ways</u>
<u n="175" who="S0320">I felt like he wasn't saying anything new</u>
<u n="176" who="S0322">he <trunc>di</trunc> he didn't really say anything I liked it though</u>
<u n="177" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0322">I could have listened to it for ages</u>
<u n="179" who="S0320">he's a very good speaker</u>
<u n="180" who="S0322" trans="overlap">and I found it very entertaining and I didn't feel like he really said anything</u>
<u n="181" who="S0320">yeah he's a very good speaker but</u>
<u n="182" who="S0322" trans="overlap">he seemed to say</u>

<u n="184" who="S0322" trans="overlap">a few thing but nothing really</u>
<u n="185" who="S0320">no I think I've I've I've heard the</u>
<u n="186" who="S0322" trans="overlap">and things didn't seem to be connected</u>
<u n="187" who="S0320" trans="overlap"><trunc>automa</trunc> automaticity <pause dur="short"/> before I've heard <trunc>th</trunc> er we did that in the DELTA</u>
<u n="188" who="S0322">well I don't understand what is new about the idea that you're</u>
<u n="189" who="S0320">there isn't anything new</u>
<u n="190" who="S0322" trans="overlap">thinking about things and then one minute he was saying the</u>
<u n="191" who="S0320" trans="overlap">I think he'd just read a book and talked about it in a slightly different way</u>
<u n="192" who="S0322" trans="overlap">mm the bubbling up</u>
<u n="193" who="S0320" trans="overlap">I think that's what it was</u>
<u n="194" who="S0322" trans="overlap">thing</u>
<u n="195" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="196" who="S0322">one minute he was saying if you're doing something else you can get some moments of epiphany</u>
<u n="197" who="S0320" trans="overlap">but it has to be complete concentrated</u>
<u n="198" who="S0322" trans="overlap">but he wasn't concentrated that's the point he was on the beach talking to his wife when he suddenly had this breakthrough he wasn't concentrating on the topic</u>
<u n="199" who="S0320">I don't think it's as though you have to have constant you have to</u>
<u n="200" who="S0322" trans="overlap">that's what he said later which didn't seem connected at all</u>
<u n="201" who="S0320" trans="overlap">no it didn't he didn't he's say maybe I misunderstood him as I say I was quite tired by then</u>
<u n="202" who="S0322">mm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="203" who="S0320">erm didn't he say that you had to have moments of concentrated work on the</u>
<u n="204" who="S0322" trans="overlap">in order to that that</u>
<u n="205" who="S0320">in order to get that bubbling</u>
<u n="206" who="S0322" trans="overlap">stuff bubbling up in the first place</u>
<u n="207" who="S0320" trans="overlap">in the first place but then</u>
<u n="208" who="S0322" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="209" who="S0320">the sudden epiphany doesn't have to be</u>
<u n="210" who="S0322" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0320" trans="overlap">while you're concentrating</u>
<u n="212" who="S0322">no</u>
<u n="213" who="S0320">cos you concentrate</u>
<u n="214" who="S0322" trans="overlap">because that's</u>
<u n="215" who="S0320" trans="overlap">and then get it down into the <unclear>lake</unclear></u>
<u n="216" who="S0322" trans="overlap">making that into yeah it's I didn't understand how that was <pause dur="short"/> anything to be honest I thought</u>
<u n="217" who="S0320" trans="overlap">my my favourite comment</u>
<u n="218" who="S0322" trans="overlap">well yes of course you have to concentrate</u>
<u n="219" who="S0320" trans="overlap">my favourite <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="220" who="S0322" trans="overlap">when you're learning something</u>
<u n="221" who="S0320">my favourite comment was well obviously you can only have an epiphany if you actually know something <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="222" who="S0322">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="223" who="S0320">if you don't know anything</u>

<u n="226" who="S0322" trans="overlap">which were kind of mm</u>
<u n="227" who="S0320"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it made me laugh</u>

<u n="232" who="S0322">unlike the <unclear>closing</unclear> fella in London when</u>

<u n="238" who="S0322">you know yes you do when the teachers</u>

<u n="242" who="S0322" trans="overlap">action research and the other thing was called something about supported erm oh when teachers just want to want to find out about something it's like a mini version of action research and they don't have to do all the</u>
<u n="243" who="S0320" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="244" who="S0322" trans="overlap">they do the sort of experimental things to say</u>
<u n="245" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="246" who="S0322">I'm gonna look at what happens if you do this</u>
<u n="247" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="248" who="S0322">or another way of doing this</u>
<u n="249" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="250" who="S0322">and then they keep trying things and the school kind of just supports them with I dunno and then they share their</u>
<u n="251" who="S0320" trans="overlap">oh okay</u>
<u n="252" who="S0322">what they found out and one of them was an example of this woman who tried to use she said when she asked concept questions she wasn't sure <pause dur="short"/> because you get a general kind of yes or no from the class cos it's just kind of shouted out</u>
<u n="253" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="254" who="S0322">she said you can't be sure if everybody has understood when you asked a concept question</u>
<u n="255" who="S0320">no</u>
<u n="256" who="S0322">so she wanted to experiment with using mini whiteboards</u>
<u n="257" who="S0320">oh</u>
<u n="258" who="S0322">so that she'd ask a concept question and they'd all write and hold up <pause dur="short"/> and I <trunc>sai</trunc></u>
<u n="259" who="S0320" trans="overlap">they mean whiteboards rather than tablets <pause dur="short"/> really?</u>
<u n="260" who="S0322">yes</u>
<u n="261" who="S0320"><trunc>wh</trunc></u>
<u n="262" who="S0322" trans="overlap">this may have been a while ago</u>
<u n="263" who="S0320">okay yeah</u>
<u n="264" who="S0322">maybe</u>
<u n="265" who="S0320">maybe not <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="266" who="S0322" trans="overlap">but then tablets? really? for the whole</u>
<u n="267" who="S0320" trans="overlap">I know</u>
<u n="268" who="S0322" trans="overlap">school?</u>
<u n="269" who="S0320" trans="overlap">but a mini whiteboard</u>
<u n="270" who="S0322">yeah that's what it was</u>
<u n="271" who="S0320"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="272" who="S0322">but then she sort of tried various initial little snippets and she found that that it was actually they <trunc>wou</trunc> found it a bit laborious and long-winded if every single</u>
<u n="273" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="274" who="S0322">question you get them actually I think they were doing it in pairs where they had to say what the answer was and if it's just a quick snappy</u>
<u n="275" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="276" who="S0322">it turned into a long-winded you know</u>
<u n="277" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="278" who="S0322">and everybody holding them up and</u>
<u n="279" who="S0320">everyone reading everyone else's</u>
<u n="280" who="S0322">yeah but then she discovered through that <pause dur="short"/> that she probably asked too many just a yes or no concept questions</u>
<u n="281" who="S0320">yeah okay</u>
<u n="282" who="S0322">and something like that so I don't know</u>
<u n="283" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="284" who="S0322">but so she kind of said this is what I want to look at</u>
<u n="285" who="S0320">oh okay</u>
<u n="286" who="S0322">and did a little mini projecty thing on there then</u>
<u n="287" who="S0320" trans="overlap">what did they say about action research then?</u>
<u n="288" who="S0322">oh I can't remember this is the thing it was at the end of the day and</u>
<u n="289" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="290" who="S0322" trans="overlap">it was something with quite a lot of kind of facts and figures and examples</u>
<u n="291" who="S0320" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="292" who="S0322">and things that was just not</u>
<u n="293" who="S0320">not very interesting</u>
<u n="294" who="S0322">no</u>
<u n="295" who="S0320">erm <pause dur="short"/> did they say</u>
<u n="296" who="S0322" trans="overlap">they had people there who won stuff they sort of had a little competition there cos some of the sessions</u>
<u n="297" who="S0320" trans="overlap">what at the end of the day?</u>
<u n="298" who="S0322" trans="overlap">there were people giving their action research results I went to one of them</u>
<u n="299" who="S0320">oh yes you did didn't you?</u>
<u n="300" who="S0322">yeah I went to oh well one of them was two actually cos each one was</u>
<u n="301" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="302" who="S0322" trans="overlap">divided into two <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> went to the other ones <pause dur="short"/> er and it was a bit <vocal desc="sigh"/> er it was all all a bit kind of</u>
<u n="303" who="S0320" trans="overlap">so I've been to an IA TEFL I went to a one that was a <trunc>mast</trunc> she was presenting her master's research paper so dull</u>
<u n="304" who="S0322">yeah this one I mean I saw one I remember it was something about erm</u>
<u n="305" who="S0320">maybe that's why they're doing it cos they want to be more like IA TEFL anyway carry on</u>
<u n="306" who="S0322">yeah what was she talking about? erm oh yeah it was the short term</u>
<u n="307" who="S0320">oh</u>
<u n="308" who="S0322">short-term learners' goals</u>
<u n="309" who="S0320">oh yes</u>
<u n="310" who="S0322">reaching their goals</u>
<u n="311" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="312" who="S0322" trans="overlap">helping them to assess their it was kind of helping er trying to help them assess their</u>
<u n="313" who="S0320" trans="overlap">their goals</u>
<u n="314" who="S0322">but as <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> pointed out all this research <vocal desc="laugh"/> is not very useful because the subjects there's about I dunno <pause dur="short"/> eighteen people</u>
<u n="315" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="316" who="S0322">in the whole experiment and you can't <vocal desc="laugh"/> really draw many conclusions from so few people because the variability in those people</u>
<u n="317" who="S0320">so you need a bigger sample size</u>
<u n="318" who="S0322" trans="overlap">you can't get any big trends sort of</u>
<u n="319" who="S0320">so what would you need to do it over a longer period?</u>
<u n="320" who="S0322" trans="overlap">you'd need to do it a lot more to to be able to because all the results were so wishy-washy as well it was like mm there's a ever so tiny slight increase in this when this happened</u>
<u n="321" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="322" who="S0322" trans="overlap">but that meant one person</u>
<u n="323" who="S0320">oh</u>
<u n="324" who="S0322" trans="overlap">or something so and they were different people they they did two waves</u>
<u n="325" who="S0320">oh</u>
<u n="326" who="S0322" trans="overlap">in one wave they'd do it one way so that was like eight people eight</u>
<u n="327" who="S0320" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="328" who="S0322" trans="overlap">students <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="329" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="330" who="S0322" trans="overlap">and the second wave of the experiment</u>
<u n="331" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="332" who="S0322">would be eight other people</u>
<u n="333" who="S0320">right</u>
<u n="334" who="S0322">so you can't draw anything from that because they could just be completely different people <pause dur="short"/> they had to erm <pause dur="short"/> try and sort of assess their own</u>
<u n="335" who="S0320">goals</u>
<u n="336" who="S0322" trans="overlap">progress</u>
<u n="337" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="338" who="S0322">the progress that they made in that and that's a very personal thing as well</u>
<u n="339" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="340" who="S0322" trans="overlap">how much you think you have</u>
<u n="341" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0322" trans="overlap">but to help them to <trunc>d</trunc> her idea was that if you can help them to identify their goals much more clearly at the beginning</u>
<u n="343" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="344" who="S0322">then they will be able to when it comes to assessing their progress when they leave</u>
<u n="345" who="S0320" trans="overlap">measure it better</u>
<u n="346" who="S0322">because they're more aware in the first place of exactly what they're doing and what they want</u>
<u n="347" who="S0320">I don't know if I agree with that though because often the goals that they set themselves are so wildly unrealistic</u>
<u n="348" who="S0322" trans="overlap">mm yeah but that's why basically it came down to</u>
<u n="349" who="S0320" trans="overlap">so <trunc>es</trunc>essentially you're gonna have to tell them what their goals are <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="350" who="S0322">it basically it came down to talking to them a lot more in depth</u>
<u n="351" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="352" who="S0322" trans="overlap">about what they want how they want to do it how they think it's going to</u>
<u n="353" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="354" who="S0322">happen</u>
<u n="355" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="356" who="S0322">rather than just getting them on a piece of paper to say</u>
<u n="357" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="358" who="S0322">if the second one was talking through it in detail exactly what well you know it said you need vocabulary what kind of vocabulary? you said you need to speak in what kind of situations? what kind of things do you want to say?</u>
<u n="359" who="S0320" trans="overlap">surely then that's the way that you conduct your research surely you would have to make a better if you want to do it through questionnaires you have to make a better questionnaire surely <pause dur="short"/> cos I presumably they would</u>
<u n="360" who="S0322" trans="overlap">well <unclear/> why don't you you just can't conclude anything from</u>
<u n="361" who="S0320">I suppose it yeah</u>
<u n="362" who="S0322">and it was kind of the same with the other one the second one was something to do with oh it was oh it was oh erm the digital learning platform</u>
<u n="363" who="S0320">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="364" who="S0322" trans="overlap">type thing it was to do with people sort of making blogs</u>
<u n="365" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="366" who="S0322" trans="overlap">kind of blogs</u>
<u n="367" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="368" who="S0322">of their or making sort of websitey things for themselves</u>
<u n="369" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="370" who="S0322" trans="overlap">a lot was aimed towards people who were going to university</u>
<u n="371" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="372" who="S0322" trans="overlap">and things like and continue it</u>
<u n="373" who="S0320" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="374" who="S0322">in the future and erm so once a week</u>
<u n="375" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="376" who="S0322">their I think it was every lesson I think it was once a week there would be a session <pause dur="short"/> once a week there was a whole session on it and then I think maybe every morning the first part they talked through what they did</u>
<u n="377" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="378" who="S0322">and they'd have to do bits of homework on it and keep <pause dur="short"/> you know written records all their homeworky things they do on this</u>
<u n="379" who="S0320">on a VLE</u>
<u n="380" who="S0322">on yeah maybe</u>
<u n="381" who="S0320">the VLE the virtual learning environment mm</u>
<u n="382" who="S0322" trans="overlap">okay maybe <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="383" who="S0320"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="384" who="S0322">maybe it was that</u>
<u n="385" who="S0320">er they use it a lot in universities</u>
<u n="386" who="S0322" trans="overlap">it seemed like a sort of yes cos he was saying that you could carry on and using the my issue again with things like <pause dur="short"/> you've got somebody coming for a week</u>
<u n="387" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="388" who="S0322">you've got somebody coming who a week who is not going to get</u>
<u n="389" who="S0320" trans="overlap">oh well these are all long-term students aren't they?</u>
<u n="390" who="S0322">I think it was the same</u>
<u n="391" who="S0320" trans="overlap">who must be on like</u>
<u n="392" who="S0322" trans="overlap">I think it's the same like we've got this great idea</u>

<u n="394" who="S0322" trans="overlap">the people that you'd have for a year <pause dur="short"/> so oh it was just about things straight away that aren't relevant to me</u>
<u n="395" who="S0320">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah fair enough so the other thing that got me as well did you notice that</u>
<u n="396" who="S0322" trans="overlap">what's that?</u>
<u n="397" who="S0320"><trunc>grea</trunc> in it's got a <unclear>Dime Bar</unclear> in it</u>

<u n="410" who="S0322" trans="overlap">books</u>

<u n="464" who="S0322">why most of our erm Arabic students</u>
<u n="465" who="S0320" trans="overlap">well the language students</u>
<u n="466" who="S0322" trans="overlap">come for eleven ten months</u>

<u n="625" who="S0322">mm</u>
<u n="626" who="S0320" trans="overlap">because of a personality clash</u>
<u n="627" who="S0322" trans="overlap">and he was saying</u>

<u n="786" who="S0320">it was only a minor thing though and it wasn't</u>

<u n="790" who="S0320" trans="overlap">which they really weren't</u>
<u n="791" who="S0322">my board work is horrendous</u>

<u n="793" who="S0322">I think it's really good I think</u>
<u n="794" who="S0320" trans="overlap">I really like not overly standardising but this I like</u>
<u n="795" who="S0322">for new teachers I mean he was also talking about whether you use erm <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> script and</u>
<u n="796" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="797" who="S0322" trans="overlap">how much you use it if you're gonna use it</u>
<u n="798" who="S0320">okay</u>
<u n="799" who="S0322">somewhere like</u>
<u n="800" who="S0320" trans="overlap">as a policy</u>
<u n="801" who="S0322" trans="overlap"><anon type="place"/> university you probably would</u>
<u n="802" who="S0320">yeah okay</u>
<u n="803" who="S0322">but that's tricky and it's definitely tricky if you're gonna have new teachers</u>
<u n="804" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="805" who="S0322">coming in certain times</u>
<u n="806" who="S0320" trans="overlap">did he say anything else about board work then? he has the standard ten vocabulary phrases</u>
<u n="807" who="S0322" trans="overlap">yeah he had the there was something else hang on <pause dur="short"/> aims at the top vocabulary on the side</u>
<u n="808" who="S0320" trans="overlap">oh right aims at the top</u>
<u n="809" who="S0322" trans="overlap">in phrases <pause dur="short"/> er must be minimum ten phrases</u>
<u n="810" who="S0320" trans="overlap">how many aims did he say?</u>
<u n="811" who="S0322">could be more</u>
<u n="812" who="S0320">okay how many aims?</u>
<u n="813" who="S0322">so that students <pause dur="short"/> mm he didn't say just aims at the top</u>
<u n="814" who="S0320">oh okay</u>
<u n="815" who="S0322" trans="overlap">you put put the aims of the lesson so the students can't say they're not learning from a certain teacher because everybody does this</u>
<u n="816" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="817" who="S0322" trans="overlap">what he said that was interesting was that erm <pause dur="short"/> when the teachers are grumbling about it or things where you've got this thing that some maybe don't want to join it he said it will police itself because the students will demand it</u>
<u n="818" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="819" who="S0322">if the students know that's what they should get they'll say to their teacher</u>
<u n="820" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="821" who="S0322">but where are the end phrases?</u>
<u n="822" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="823" who="S0322" trans="overlap">or but where's the aim?</u>
<u n="824" who="S0320">actually now I think about it I think the one of DoSses that I worked with might have tried might have implemented one of something</u>
<u n="825" who="S0322" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="826" who="S0320" trans="overlap">like this before</u>
<u n="827" who="S0322" trans="overlap">but I thought it was quite interesting when he was saying that the students if they know</u>
<u n="828" who="S0320" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="829" who="S0322" trans="overlap">they should get that</u>
<u n="830" who="S0320">yeah of course</u>
<u n="831" who="S0322">probably would</u>
<u n="832" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="833" who="S0322" trans="overlap">make sure erm yes he also said the same colours for certain things</u>
<u n="834" who="S0320">ah</u>
<u n="835" who="S0322">all use the same colours for marking certain things like this colour for marking phonology for this colour</u>
<u n="836" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="837" who="S0322" trans="overlap">for marking what erm I don't know maybe word type it is or something</u>
<u n="838" who="S0320">oh that's interesting</u>
<u n="839" who="S0322">yeah</u>
<u n="840" who="S0320">mm</u>
<u n="841" who="S0322">but then of course you've got to have time to have the training <pause dur="short"/> to standardise this stuff</u>
<u n="842" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="843" who="S0322">haven't you?</u>
<u n="844" who="S0320" trans="overlap">for words you haven't I'm pretty sure that comes up in DELTA quite a lot</u>
<u n="845" who="S0322">well</u>
<u n="846" who="S0320" trans="overlap">putting like vocabulary phrases on the board <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="847" who="S0322" trans="overlap">I don't think you would still have to all agree and</u>
<u n="848" who="S0320" trans="overlap">you would have to</u>
<u n="849" who="S0322" trans="overlap">when new people come</u>
<u n="850" who="S0320">you would have to</u>
<u n="851" who="S0322" trans="overlap">it would have to be</u>
<u n="852" who="S0320" trans="overlap">you'd have to do the training because also the less experienced teachers getting ten vocabulary phrases out of a listening lesson</u>
<u n="853" who="S0322">yeah</u>
<u n="854" who="S0320">can be quite challenging</u>
<u n="855" who="S0322">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean there there would be a lot more planning involved than currently what happens</u>
<u n="856" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="857" who="S0322" trans="overlap">with a lot of teachers</u>
<u n="858" who="S0320">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well not <trunc>rea</trunc> do you think so?</u>
<u n="859" who="S0322">cos you're supposed to have stated aims</u>
<u n="860" who="S0320">I don't yeah I'm not</u>
<u n="861" who="S0322" trans="overlap">and targets language</u>
<u n="862" who="S0320">the I'm not a fan of the stated aims I have to say</u>
<u n="863" who="S0322">no I don't</u>
<u n="864" who="S0320">er</u>
<u n="865" who="S0322" trans="overlap">anyway</u>
<u n="866" who="S0320">but again for newly qualified teachers</u>
<u n="867" who="S0322" trans="overlap">sometimes I'm really relieved that the students don't know what I had planned</u>

<u n="869" who="S0322">because what happens ends up being nothing like it</u>

<u n="871" who="S0322" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="872" who="S0320">a week menu</u>
<u n="873" who="S0322">uhu</u>

<u n="881" who="S0322" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="882" who="S0320" trans="overlap">want to do this okay <pause dur="short"/> okay so</u>

<u n="887" who="S0322">so</u>
<u n="888" who="S0320" trans="overlap">what else?</u>
<u n="889" who="S0322" trans="overlap">the house style basically he was talking about collective responsibility</u>
<u n="890" who="S0320">oh okay</u>
<u n="891" who="S0322">that that must include all teachers and I was just trying to imagine any of that stuff at work</u>
<u n="892" who="S0320" trans="overlap">what do you mean? <pause dur="short"/> what do you mean the collective responsibility?</u>

<u n="898" who="S0320" trans="overlap">you have to have collective responsibility</u>

<u n="904" who="S0320" trans="overlap">this all sounds very idealistic</u>
<u n="905" who="S0322" trans="overlap">you have to aim at consistency of quality so that you can create a brand a real brand <pause dur="short"/> but what was interesting and you'll like this I thought about this <pause dur="short"/> is in order to find out what lengths an elective teaching team</u>
<u n="906" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="907" who="S0322">from the point of students</u>

<u n="1132" who="S0320">product isn't it? and you just have to</u>

<u n="1616" who="S0320">yeah</u>
<u n="1617" who="S0322">because if you <trunc>thi</trunc> it is kind of taking responsibility it saying we care what goes on</u>
<u n="1618" who="S0320">what the managers</u>
<u n="1619" who="S0322" trans="overlap">and also</u>
<u n="1620" who="S0320" trans="overlap">taking responsibility?</u>
<u n="1621" who="S0322" trans="overlap">makes it easier to a certain point for a new teachers coming in</u>

<u n="1623" who="S0322" trans="overlap">if they're told at the beginning this is the way we do</u>
<u n="1624" who="S0320"><vocal desc="sigh"/> but I I do you know who I think the best person to implement that would be? can you guess about of all the people that they've got there who would be the best to introduce it and implement it?</u>
<u n="1625" who="S0322">I don't know</u>
<u n="1626" who="S0320"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> loves his lists <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> loves things being standardised it's not his job but he would be absolutely hands down the best person to introduce it</u>

<u n="1633" who="S0322" trans="overlap">why is it not his role that then?</u>
<u n="1634" who="S0320">because he's not involved in the classroom stuff he's just involved in the lists isn't he?</u>

<u n="1636" who="S0320">I know that but effectively <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>thi</trunc> yeah if they were gonna do it would be</u>
