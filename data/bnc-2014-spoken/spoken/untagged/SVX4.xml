<u n="133" who="S0295" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="134" who="S0012" trans="overlap">I saw the start of that but I didn't see the end</u>
<u n="135" who="S0294" trans="overlap">yes well it was quite interesting and er they've got I mean he's he's obviously trying to sell his wares but he's <trunc>a</trunc> he's actually selling his English tea abroad</u>
<u n="136" who="S0295">to China</u>
<u n="137" who="S0294">to China and Lebanon</u>

<u n="139" who="S0294">but it's erm it's erm <pause dur="short"/> I mean it didn't seem to me that there's any good reason why it shouldn't be possible to do it in the UK because the sort of areas in India where it grows you know are wet and and er cooler weather</u>
<u n="140" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0294">because it's up in the hills isn't it? <unclear/></u>

<u n="143" who="S0294">my geography's not brilliant but er</u>

<u n="145" who="S0294">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0012">are colder hill like our north-facing</u>
<u n="147" who="S0294" trans="overlap">yes yes</u>
<u n="148" who="S0012">hills maybe <pause dur="short"/> in India it would be cooler</u>
<u n="149" who="S0294">anyway it was it was interesting because erm where he he he made a success he's making a success of it and he had other people who were interested and so it was the possibility of having a special special tea growers I don't think there's anything very magical or very difficult about it</u>
<u n="150" who="S0012">no I don't well you can grow camellias and</u>
<u n="151" who="S0294">yeah that's right</u>
<event desc="unintelligible"/>
