<u n="551" who="S0623">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="552" who="S0525">maybe twenty thirty on a job this size and then you've got the bank fees like I say twenty twenty-five thousand so when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> decides to cut to cut his profit down to a hundred thousand</u>

<u n="555" who="S0623">no</u>
<u n="556" who="S0525">so they'll cut the profit to get the job and then <pause dur="short"/> all those costs</u>
<u n="557" who="S0623" trans="overlap">that's yeah</u>
<u n="558" who="S0525" trans="overlap">will eat into it</u>
<u n="559" who="S0623"><vocal desc="laugh"/> they have no idea do they?</u>
<u n="560" who="S0525">they don't really so if <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> thought he was being ripped off at fifteen grand I thought he's got he never he just didn't get involved</u>
<u n="561" who="S0623"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
