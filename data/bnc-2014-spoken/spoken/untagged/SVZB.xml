<u n="1477" who="S0192">if their parents are loaded they'll send them abroad but if most people don't I mean it's a thing although I see the population is the same as England but in England we've got about a hundred and twenty universities in the whole country in Korea they have over three hundred so they've got almost three times the amount of unis that we've got because like ninety-five percent of people go to uni in fact this is they call it school they don't really see it as something different in England we wouldn't we wouldn't say universities as schools it's not school it's almost mandatory</u>

<u n="1480" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1481" who="S0192">and they don't really understand when I'm like no uni is not school then they're like yeah it is but like</u>
<u n="1482" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1483" who="S0192">I mean the word <foreign lang="kor"/> means school and university is <foreign lang="kor"/> which means like grand school you know what I'm saying?</u>
<u n="1484" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1485" who="S0192">it's school you know? so on the one hand some of their society</u>
<u n="1486" who="S0193" trans="overlap">it's quite regimented in their studies</u>
<u n="1487" who="S0192">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="1488" who="S0193">very important</u>
<u n="1489" who="S0192">and it's sad because they're very na√Øve and very like not they're not wise about the world they don't have much street wisdom or anything</u>
<u n="1490" who="S0193">but then when they study and they're doing all this <pause dur="short"/> erm when then study so much and they're coming out with university degrees and good jobs do they then go abroad? or do they just stay?</u>
<u n="1491" who="S0192">some do they're getting better they're definitely travelling more and travelling more is opening up their eyes to ways other people live and what's going on so the society I come back to England and I say oh they've built a new school or something but really England's changing very slowly it's not it's not really changing like <anon type="place"/> <anon type="place"/> is changing very very quickly and they like they don't leave any buildings to stand every time a building hits forty years old they knock it down and build something else so like nothing they can't understand when I say that I grew up in a house that was you know <unclear/> they just find that <unclear/> and like there's a church down the road that's like six hundred years old they just they can't believe it nothing in their country is older than forty years old</u>
<u n="1492" who="S0193">wow <pause dur="long"/> oh that's strange isn't it?</u>
<u n="1493" who="S0192">but they follow the American <unclear/> same as the states it it stimulates economy it's capitalism so in the States they do the same they don't change a building they knock it down and build a new one so if your <unclear/></u>
<u n="1494" who="S0193">but you see that would that's sad to me</u>
<u n="1495" who="S0192">it is sad it's wasted material</u>

<u n="1510" who="S0192">the way people are about things it's very difficult to push things through in government because we have all these rules and regulations on how things must be</u>
<u n="1511" who="S0193">yeah</u>

<u n="1517" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1518" who="S0192">just off the coast terrible planning they'll never admit it really but the whole reason is because they listen to orders from above and the order came out do not move so everyone sat in the ship and it took the ship an hour to sink and for ages they're just sitting on this ship slowly tilts and by the time its tilted and all the rescue crews are there they can't get them out and they stayed in there because they'd been ordered to stay in there it's ridiculous</u>
<u n="1519" who="S0193">mm</u>
<u n="1520" who="S0192">so they've now completed changed policy and like really stepped up on their like health and safety on boats and all this kind of stuff but it's it's sad that things that that's part of their <trunc>s</trunc> it's part of their social problem really is they they do they have what's called a Confucian hierarchy I don't know if you've ever heard of Confucius? he's have you heard of him? <unclear>don't matter</unclear> he was like a</u>

<u n="1525" who="S0193">yeah</u>
<u n="1526" who="S0192">and then there's your place in society and what you must do it's kind of like a caste system affectively but it's like through peers and through youe your people that are above you</u>
<u n="1527" who="S0193" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
