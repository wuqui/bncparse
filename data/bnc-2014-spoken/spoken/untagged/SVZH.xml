<u n="647" who="S0231"><unclear/> with that</u>
<u n="648" who="S0198">no</u>
<u n="649" who="S0231">I've tried it</u>
<u n="650" who="S0198">maybe it's still slightly different software then</u>
<u n="651" who="S0231">but that's a smart <pause dur="short"/> android phone</u>
<u n="652" who="S0198">yeah <pause dur="short"/> ah <pause dur="short"/> how long have you had that <pause dur="short"/> actual phone?</u>

<u n="657" who="S0231" trans="overlap">no yeah I got a contract separate</u>
<u n="658" who="S0198">alright then <pause dur="short"/> I'm trying to make decide what the best cos I don't <trunc>e</trunc> I don't particularly like this phone either that dad's given me <pause dur="short"/> it's really er</u>
<u n="659" who="S0231">what is it? let's have a look</u>
<u n="660" who="S0198">it's men I'm I didn't know but my friends've told me it's ripping off a Blackberry</u>
<u n="661" who="S0231">oh</u>
<u n="662" who="S0198">and now we don't know <unclear/> what Blackberry's used to be like</u>
<u n="663" who="S0231" trans="overlap">oh is this what <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had?</u>
<u n="664" who="S0198">no dad had it for ages I think he got it from a boot <pause dur="short"/> I don't think he got it from anyone else</u>
<u n="665" who="S0231">he gave it to the <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> didn't he? for a little while</u>
<u n="666" who="S0198">oh did he? <pause dur="short"/> but whenever</u>
<u n="667" who="S0231">where's that other thing you had?</u>
<u n="668" who="S0198">I've just had flip phone which I've still got upstairs</u>
<u n="669" who="S0231" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="670" who="S0198">and it's really simple and I tempted to go back to it because this thing <pause dur="short"/> is really easy to unlock like somehow I keep sending blank text messages to people which is probably <trunc>c</trunc> er literally and it will send it won't just send one it sends four messages in a row within a minute because it like leans on the one set button and it'll just keep doing it <pause dur="short"/> and also the buttons are kind of really close together</u>
<u n="671" who="S0231">too small ain't they?</u>
<u n="672" who="S0198">yeah really close together <pause dur="short"/> so like normally you have that amount of buttons don't you? and then <pause dur="short"/> they're like twice the size</u>
<u n="673" who="S0231">well it's</u>
<u n="674" who="S0198"><trunc>sep</trunc> but a part of me really likes they I like the size and the feel of that</u>
<u n="675" who="S0231" trans="overlap">I mean if you went if you went to a Three shop right?</u>
<u n="676" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="677" who="S0231" trans="overlap">you could probably get a contract <pause dur="short"/> that's probably about thirty quid now</u>
<u n="678" who="S0198">mm</u>
<u n="679" who="S0231">and er <pause dur="short"/> er if you slide it down you got the rotation <pause dur="short"/> and if you're doing a text message <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>turn</unclear> that off <pause dur="short"/> and turn it sideways</u>
<u n="680" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="681" who="S0231">and then you got <trunc>i</trunc>it makes the keys bigger for you</u>
<u n="682" who="S0198" trans="overlap">bigger see I've got have you seen my MP3 player? it's like that <pause dur="short"/> this is basically a phone without being a phone <pause dur="short"/> samsung</u>
<u n="683" who="S0231">oh I thought that was a phone</u>
<u n="684" who="S0198">no it's not a phone all it is is an MP3 player that can pick up wi-fi <pause dur="short"/> so it's an <trunc>i</trunc> it's called an Iplayer <pause dur="short"/> it's a Samsung</u>
<u n="685" who="S0231">oh right like an Ipod</u>
<u n="686" who="S0198">yeah oh yeah the Ipods can do it as well can't they?</u>
<u n="687" who="S0231">yeah I think so</u>
<u n="688" who="S0198">like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> watches all his videos on there</u>
<u n="689" who="S0231" trans="overlap">yeah he watches Youtube everything</u>
<u n="690" who="S0198" trans="overlap">so providing like I can't receive data I can't get internet anywhere but if there's a wi-fi <pause dur="short"/> I can use the wi-fi for free</u>
<u n="691" who="S0231">oh right</u>
<u n="692" who="S0198">and then it acts like a <pause dur="short"/> like a phone</u>
<u n="693" who="S0231">I thought that was a phone</u>
<u n="694" who="S0198">no <pause dur="short"/> it's really confusing cos in Korea people don't believe me when I say I don't have a phone they think I'm lying to them cos I've got this out or whatever and they don't believe me I'm like no no it's not a phone it's <pause dur="short"/> but it has the same thing on it it has a keyboard on it that you can work with <pause dur="short"/> that your turn sideways er it's the same as yours <pause dur="short"/> and you know that's much easier to type on</u>
<u n="695" who="S0231" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="696" who="S0198">than that</u>
<u n="697" who="S0231">well if I'm honest with you <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> goes on the internet more than what I do</u>
<u n="698" who="S0198">yeah <pause dur="short"/> do <trunc>y</trunc> oh yeah but you get you don't have wi-fi in your <trunc>m</trunc> apartment though flat?</u>
<u n="699" who="S0231" trans="overlap">I don't need to cos I've got <trunc>fr</trunc><trunc>f</trunc></u>
<u n="700" who="S0198" trans="overlap">no cos you've got that yeah</u>
<u n="701" who="S0231">I've got free internet there's no need for me to have</u>
<u n="702" who="S0198" trans="overlap">it's really changed hasn't it? the way phones it's like do you remember like in like a really short amount of time as well</u>
<u n="703" who="S0231">in the space of about five years</u>
<u n="704" who="S0198">yeah I've gone from my Vodafone flip phone to being a bit out of date</u>
<u n="705" who="S0231" trans="overlap">yeah you had wi-fi?</u>
<u n="706" who="S0198">to everything</u>
<u n="707" who="S0231">and that <pause dur="short"/> basically if you've got free internet what is the point in wi-fi?</u>
<u n="708" who="S0198">no yeah oh yeah to have wi-fi I guess it's still for erm</u>
<u n="709" who="S0231" trans="overlap">unless</u>
<u n="710" who="S0198">it's still for</u>
<u n="711" who="S0231" trans="overlap">them big tablets and all that but</u>
<u n="712" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah or for like computers laptops still</u>
<u n="713" who="S0231">oh I know but I've got TV guide thing app I downloaded the other day</u>
<u n="714" who="S0198" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> and still useful for <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>f</trunc> if you want a proper computer still</u>
<u n="715" who="S0231">yeah I mean</u>
<u n="716" who="S0198" trans="overlap">then it's useful to have the wi-fi</u>
<u n="717" who="S0231">I do all my job searches on here everything</u>
<u n="718" who="S0198" trans="overlap">yeah I know it's really handy</u>
<u n="719" who="S0231" trans="overlap">but I don't tell the job centre that</u>
<u n="720" who="S0198">no</u>
<u n="721" who="S0231">I say I have to go to the library</u>
<u n="722" who="S0198">yeah well</u>
<u n="723" who="S0231">they haven't paid me for about nearly a month</u>
<u n="724" who="S0198">it's good that you're so good with it cos sometimes I <trunc>f</trunc> I lose my patience using a device but <pause dur="short"/> you seem to get on quite well with that</u>
<u n="725" who="S0231">mm yeah it's strange innit?</u>
<u n="726" who="S0198">but it depends how well <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc>it functions as well because this is really an MP3 player I don't think its <pause dur="short"/> its like internet functions very good whereas I think all these smartphones are a bit smoother</u>
<u n="727" who="S0231">my mates <unclear/> sometimes it takes longer sometimes it don't</u>
<u n="728" who="S0198" trans="overlap">it takes longer yeah <pause dur="short"/> same with this I guess</u>
<u n="729" who="S0231" trans="overlap">I mean normally that TV guide would be there now but <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="730" who="S0198" trans="overlap">handy though cos</u>
<u n="731" who="S0231">cos we've got dodgy signal</u>
<u n="732" who="S0198">yeah</u>
<u n="733" who="S0231">I don't go out and buy the papers and that <unclear>no more</unclear></u>
<u n="734" who="S0198">no and also it means like you said it's <pause dur="short"/> cos the other day when I was er before I went over <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s <pause dur="short"/> dad <trunc>s</trunc> dad said something like I call you and I said well I'll try facebooking him in case he checks his Facebook often <pause dur="short"/> and that's a free way to contact someone now isn't it?</u>
