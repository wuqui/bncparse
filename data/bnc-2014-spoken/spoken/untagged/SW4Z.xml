<u n="270" who="S0589">why didn't you want to meet there?</u>
<u n="271" who="S0588">cos I thought it would be a bit noisy <pause dur="short"/> it's a very noisy pub</u>
<u n="272" who="S0589">that was perspicacious of you</u>
<u n="273" who="S0588">that was what? <vocal desc="laugh"/> what what's the word?</u>
<u n="274" who="S0589">er perspicacious</u>
<u n="275" who="S0588">what does that mean?</u>
<u n="276" who="S0589">foresight good foresight <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="277" who="S0588">how come you remember all these long words?</u>
<u n="278" who="S0589">just come across them a lot</u>
<u n="279" who="S0588">what in crosswords? <pause dur="short"/> is that mainly it?</u>
<u n="280" who="S0589">I think so</u>
<u n="281" who="S0588">but then how does your brain retain them?</u>
<u n="282" who="S0589">I get used to them dear</u>
<u n="283" who="S0588">my brain's like a sieve</u>
<u n="284" who="S0589">well so is mine</u>
<u n="285" who="S0588">no it's not cos you can draw on words when you need them I have to find them <pause dur="short"/> I think crosswords are very good though</u>
<u n="286" who="S0589">uhu</u>
<u n="287" who="S0588">but I was noticing when I did brain training and the memory games I can only do them if I use words so if it's remembering an order as in symbols or shapes I have to say the name of each and then I can remember them I can remember a sequence of names but I can't remember it just by looking <pause dur="short"/> so I have to sort of go blue green green blue yellow and then I'll remember the sequence</u>
<u n="288" who="S0589">it's a mnemonic</u>
<u n="289" who="S0588">it is a form of a mnemonic well it is a mnemonic but it's and so I can only remember things with mnemonics or in mnemonic form and yet I mean for example if you're tracing erm you have to follow the route of the robot and remember it but if I count the number of squares it's gone down you could do it almost mathematically and then you'd remember but just visually</u>
<u n="290" who="S0589">but people have different</u>
<u n="291" who="S0588" trans="overlap">it's really hard to do different</u>
<u n="292" who="S0589">skills and ways</u>
<u n="293" who="S0588" trans="overlap">skills and ways of remembering but</u>
<u n="294" who="S0589">like Proust and smell of his Madeleine cakes</u>
<u n="295" who="S0588">what does that mean?</u>
<u n="296" who="S0589">it's the smell that or that he remembers</u>
<u n="297" who="S0588">but that's more of an emotional memory</u>
<u n="298" who="S0589">darling why don't you have that last prawn or the last bit of erm?</u>
<u n="299" who="S0588">I'm going to have the last prawn and then I'm full</u>
<u n="300" who="S0589">shall I have that bit of?</u>
<u n="301" who="S0588">yeah</u>
<u n="302" who="S0589">it's actually a double bit <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="303" who="S0588">but I think when you get past a point in music and reading music <pause dur="short"/> past a certain point you're <pause dur="short"/> you're not having to do anything mnemonically cos musical notes are first of all a mnemonic poem</u>
<u n="304" who="S0589" trans="overlap">you just read it</u>
<u n="305" who="S0588">yeah you go every good boy deserves fruit that's how you're taught to remember it E B E G B D</u>
<u n="306" who="S0589">yeah</u>
<u n="307" who="S0588" trans="overlap">F <pause dur="short"/> so there's a point where you don't need that anymore and there's a point where you just glance and your hand would go to the right place which of course</u>
<u n="308" who="S0589" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="309" who="S0588" trans="overlap">as soon as you start doing things by feel it makes a lot more sense like touch typing</u>
