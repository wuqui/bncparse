<u n="852" who="S0104">yeah exactly <pause dur="short"/> any fad diet can't be maintained</u>
<u n="853" who="S0376">no</u>
<u n="854" who="S0104" trans="overlap">it's you've just got to eat</u>

<u n="858" who="S0104" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="859" who="S0374">this lady I read some of the key points of her erm approach are you can't call <trunc>fi</trunc> foods good or bad foods or treats because then you crave the bad foods because you're not supposed to have them food is food if you everything in moderation like what she was saying was sensible so that's why I was sort of looking it's sort of like a Slimming Worldy sort of thing it sounds like</u>

<u n="864" who="S0104">mm</u>
<u n="865" who="S0374" trans="overlap">but erm so it was all quite sensible stuff so that's why I'm thinking it probably was where he's been to all these parties and stuff</u>
<u n="866" who="S0104">mm</u>
<u n="867" who="S0374" trans="overlap">and drinking alcohol he's probably retained all this water</u>
<u n="868" who="S0104">mm</u>
<u n="869" who="S0374" trans="overlap">then he's thought I'm gonna start eating sort of sensible food and he he that's where he's lost it it's in water retention <pause dur="short"/> but erm</u>
<u n="870" who="S0104" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
