<u n="117" who="S0227">that made me go back and then er because one of the girls was there I took a bit of a shine to erm I that kind of prompted me to go back more but I'd gone back in seventy-eight but erm I didn't feel particularly welcome cos I I think still <unclear/> the taint of the erm not being one of the favourites was still there but when I went back now again in in eighty-two I could drive and and acquired a lot more polish I was more charmed more accomplished more <unclear>able to</unclear></u>
<u n="118" who="S0192">of a man</u>

<u n="143" who="S0227">yeah she er I was looking for for a girl called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> when I went into the guard room and bumped into your mum I think erm your your mum's initial take on me was that she found to be boring but probably the reason was was I realised she she was just freshly married so er</u>
<u n="144" who="S0192">stayed away</u>
<u n="145" who="S0227">she well you would do wouldn't you really? you would then talk about things that are not kind of</u>
<u n="146" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0227">but er then er</u>
<u n="148" who="S0192">yeah I don't know much about her first husband at all in fact I know nothing I don't even know his name</u>
<u n="149" who="S0227">er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="150" who="S0192"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="151" who="S0227"><trunc>i</trunc>ironically <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s name is middle name is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="152" who="S0192">but named after your friend</u>
<u n="153" who="S0227" trans="overlap">after yeah not him</u>
<u n="154" who="S0192"><unclear/></u>
<u n="155" who="S0227">yeah that just turned out to be a coincidence yeah his name was <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> spelt with an E</u>
<u n="156" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="157" who="S0227">and er</u>
<u n="158" who="S0192">so how long had they been married when you met mum?</u>
<u n="159" who="S0227">oh about a year at the most</u>
<u n="160" who="S0192">and how long was she married to him for?</u>
<u n="161" who="S0227">about eighteen months yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0192">so they divorced pretty quickly then</u>
<u n="163" who="S0227">er yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0192">some reason in the back of my head I got I had the feeling that she was still married to him when you had me</u>
<u n="165" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="166" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="167" who="S0227">no no she was er</u>

<u n="172" who="S0192">really quick</u>
<u n="173" who="S0227">me <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0192">fair</u>
<u n="175" who="S0227">me <vocal desc="laugh"/> that's the reason why</u>
<u n="176" who="S0192">so you went from boring to breaking apart her marriage in the matter of about six months?</u>
<u n="177" who="S0227">er longer than that there was a what happened was if you it didn't really kick eighty-three was when I met her I think she might have started to take a shine to me although I initially like she said she thought I was boring but the looks obviously erm</u>
<u n="178" who="S0192">helped <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="179" who="S0227"><unclear/> made an impact</u>
<u n="180" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0227">and I had a girlfriend there anyway and erm she then we kind of fraternised a bit well quite a lot but not nothing <trunc>goin</trunc> cos I still had a girlfriend so I was yeah just a bit of flirtation</u>
<u n="182" who="S0192">bit of banter</u>
<u n="183" who="S0227">bit of banter yeah that's it then erm the home was cutting down and they were making people redundant so your mum rather than having redundancy there was <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s was taking on some so she went to work at <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> went to <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>'s as well cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s on the scene <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was at the home</u>
<u n="184" who="S0192">yeah</u>

<u n="914" who="S0192">they had to come down on Sunday they were probably there for about four hours</u>
<u n="915" who="S0227">oh right so they were there for a reasonable amount of time</u>
<u n="916" who="S0192">I I cooked some scones and we had cream tea and then we took <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> out to the park erm</u>

<u n="924" who="S0192">no no of course</u>
<u n="925" who="S0227">but if she trains it's not a problem you can pick her up at the station</u>
<u n="926" who="S0192">it's nice there though I've got I'm only fifteen minutes from the sea really as the</u>
<u n="927" who="S0227">yeah that sounds <unclear>far</unclear> when one immediately thinks of a car but no it's fifteen minutes by foot by foot</u>
<u n="928" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no fifteen minute walk yeah just go down into it</u>
<u n="929" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="930" who="S0192">erm</u>
<u n="931" who="S0227">it's all downhill isn't it from your house?</u>
<u n="932" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah it's all downhill</u>
<u n="933" who="S0190">what's the uni like?</u>
<u n="934" who="S0192">university's I think quite nice the campus is nice it's very well facilitated it's a lot <trunc>bet</trunc>better than <anon type="place"/> where I went before but I don't like the architecture it was built in the sixties</u>
<u n="935" who="S0190">oh art deco deco whatever</u>
<u n="936" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah it's this glass plate university thing</u>
<u n="937" who="S0227">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="938" who="S0192">same as <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s actually it's the same they built another eight universities around the country in the sixties and they're all called glass plate universities <anon type="place"/> was the first <anon type="place"/> was the second and then there was a few others and they're all kind of very modern</u>
<u n="939" who="S0190" trans="overlap">the digs er for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> brilliant aren't they? we loved it</u>
<u n="940" who="S0192">yeah is it nice?</u>
<u n="941" who="S0227">we didn't managed to saw the uni but we saw his where he is it's</u>
<u n="942" who="S0190" trans="overlap">oh it's lovely it's like little holiday village</u>
<u n="943" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="944" who="S0190">it's set amongst the trees</u>
<u n="945" who="S0192">what a great place to live for a year</u>
<u n="946" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="947" who="S0190">oh absolutely</u>
<u n="948" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="949" who="S0192">I never got to live on campus I was always off campus</u>
<u n="950" who="S0227">yes yeah you didn't did you?</u>
<u n="951" who="S0192">no it was erm <anon type="place"/> quite a small university there's only I mean <anon type="place"/> now has got like thirteen thousand students <anon type="place"/>'s got about fifteen thousand <anon type="place"/> had five <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="952" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="953" who="S0192">erm and you could only fit probably normally a British university will only fit the first year on campus anyway</u>
<u n="954" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="955" who="S0192">you can't and maybe some international students but we could probably only fit about half of the first year on campus so</u>
<u n="956" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="957" who="S0192">the other half had to kind of live but I actually I had a good time and we we were still in university accommodation but just off off campus</u>
<u n="958" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="959" who="S0192">but the course is really good people are really friendly and nice it's quite intense</u>
<u n="960" who="S0190" trans="overlap">how many are on your course?</u>
<u n="961" who="S0192">erm there's only twelve of us on the <trunc>appl</trunc> the MA applied linguistics course</u>
<u n="962" who="S0190">and that's you and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> as well on that?</u>
<u n="963" who="S0192">yep erm</u>
<u n="964" who="S0190">there's only <trunc>twel</trunc></u>
<u n="965" who="S0192">and out of the twelve only three of us are British erm we have two people from Saudi Arabia we have</u>
<u n="966" who="S0227"><foreign lang="ara">alal rakba</foreign></u>
<u n="967" who="S0192">we have a Polish person we have a Dutch person we have cos it's linguistics so they've been studying linguistics in their own country</u>
<u n="968" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="969" who="S0192">and they've come to kind of do it in England I'm actually taking some third year undergraduate courses erm you can choose to do one postgraduate or two third year undergraduate modules so it's actually kind of more work I have to do more study and I'm effectively splitting more of my time so I have to go into university more I have to read more and do all that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="970" who="S0227"><trunc>wha</trunc>what end are you doing this extra work for?</u>
<u n="971" who="S0192">erm just because the module was more interesting I</u>
<u n="972" who="S0227">ah</u>
<u n="973" who="S0192">that's what I er I'm doing a module in pidgins and creoles and then I'm doing a module in syntactic theory which is basically cognitive science so</u>
<u n="974" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="975" who="S0192">I'm doing a cognitive science module er but they're with they only run them for undergraduates in their third year</u>
<u n="976" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="977" who="S0192">the level's quite hard I mean</u>
<u n="978" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="979" who="S0192">I'm doing more because I'm also doing my postgraduate modules as well</u>
<u n="980" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="981" who="S0192">but erm I'm actually with undergraduates so my classes are a little bit bigger for those two classes probably like fifteen to twenty students whereas in my postgraduate classes probably only about six students in each class cos although there's twelve of us that's split between a bunch of different modules so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s doing one module that crosses over with English language teaching so she's doing second language acquisition erm and then that's quite a large class and they're all teachers they're all more teachery</u>
<u n="982" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="983" who="S0192">but it's good we also have a mandatory three hour erm it's called roles they do like they get researchers to come in and give speeches about linguistics every couple of weeks so we have to go in and do that as well so I'm actually doing quite a few more hours than I was doing at my undergraduate</u>
<u n="984" who="S0227">yes at least you don't have to like go and only have a few hours of tuition and you've got to go and research everything yourself</u>
<u n="985" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="986" who="S0227">cos I don't think with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s because erm one of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s nest nieces erm that is what she has to do but the majority of it is <trunc>re</trunc>research but like with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> with like computers you've got to be actually on these computers you can't say well go to the library and <trunc>re</trunc>read books about it and pull off the net</u>
<u n="987" who="S0192">I mean he'll have to do that as well obviously</u>
<u n="988" who="S0227">yeah but he he needs to have obviously front end like the business end of of</u>
<u n="989" who="S0192">well the next step up once you go to PHD is not taught at all it's just research</u>
<u n="990" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="991" who="S0192">all research so they're preparing us for that now so although I have three hours a week for each module they tell us that we're expected to do between ten to twenty hours additional on top of that per module</u>
<u n="992" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="993" who="S0192">so I I'm currently putting in about seven hours of study a day</u>
<u n="994" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="995" who="S0192">maybe eight hours</u>
<u n="996" who="S0227">oh</u>
<u n="997" who="S0192">I have reading wise I do four modules and every module has a weekly reading list and then a wider reading list on top of that but the weekly reading list is about ten books</u>
<u n="998" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="999" who="S0192">per module and maybe one to two chapters in each book so total is about forty to fifty chapters a week that I have to read</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0227">oh</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0192">which is ridiculous so there's a lot of reading and then we come in and basically if you haven't done the reading you can't talk about in class what what you've done the reading about</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0192">but we've been doing erm I was analysing German today and in my syntactic analysis class I definitely feel more like I'm doing a linguistics course so</u>
<event desc="unintelligible"/>
<u n="1004" who="S0190">here <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="1005" who="S0227">I I would imagine that you're glad that this is a one year course and that this intensitly intensity you wouldn't wanna go in for three years</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0192">no not at this level no</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0227">too too onersome</u>
<u n="1008" who="S0192">if I had the money I think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I would have liked to have maybe done it part time cos you can do it over two years</u>
<u n="1009" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1010" who="S0192">and then it's I guess easier because you're spreading that same workload over two years</u>
<u n="1011" who="S0227">just spread the load yeah</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0192">but it would just cost so much to stay in England for two years doing that</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes yeah indeed yeah</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0192">erm</u>
<u n="1015" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1016" who="S0192">it's good the lecturers are nice it's quite a high standard</u>
<u n="1017" who="S0227">I mean cos you're like you said because you're doing your <trunc>M</trunc> your master's you're quite mature students even <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> really</u>
<u n="1018" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1019" who="S0227">he's going to be older than quite a few of his peers</u>
<u n="1020" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1021" who="S0227">because er they're gonna come fresh out of school and they're eighteen where he he's a little more seasoned he's bimbled into work</u>
<u n="1022" who="S0192">he's travelled</u>
<u n="1023" who="S0227">he's travelled he's he's been to quite a few places if you think</u>
<u n="1024" who="S0192">for his age yeah</u>
<u n="1025" who="S0227">for his age I think he's been to he's been to San Francisco he's been to the Canary Islands he's been to German he's been to France he's been to</u>
<u n="1026" who="S0192">Korea</u>
<u n="1027" who="S0227">Korea</u>
<u n="1028" who="S0192">Japan</u>
<u n="1029" who="S0227">Japan</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0192">Cambodia</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0227">Cambodia Thailand</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1033" who="S0227">that for a person his age yep this isn't like just going over to France and Benidorm or something you know this is travelled so</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0227">this will make him quite an interesting person</u>
<u n="1036" who="S0192">whether or not undergraduates care though I think is the problem I found in my undergraduates courses they're like they didn't seem to it doesn't faze them that I've been living out of the UK for six years</u>
<u n="1037" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0192">I thought that was quite an interesting feature but they're no</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0192">no interest whatsoever just</u>
<u n="1041" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="1042" who="S0192">but erm there are a few people on the MA course that are fresh out of their undergraduate</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0192">so I er I there's the only other British person is called <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and she's only twenty-one she's just graduated from thingamajig so she seems quite a bit younger to me</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0192">but erm</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1048" who="S0192">no it's nice if you well when you come up I'll er we can take you up to the campus what's really nice is that it's only a ten-minute train which is lovely and it's only a ten-minute walk to the train so</u>
<u n="1049" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1050" who="S0192">I feel like I can get to and from university very quickly</u>
<u n="1051" who="S0227">how far is the actual university from</u>
<u n="1052" who="S0192">it's about seven kilometres from home</u>
<u n="1053" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1054" who="S0192">so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I cycled once</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1056" who="S0192">but</u>

<u n="1058" who="S0192"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> cycled again the problem is once we get on to <anon type="place"/> there's a very clear run for about four kilometres and it's nice but between where I live and <anon type="place"/> there's a lot of roadworks and a lot of one-way roads and it's not very safe cycling I don't think</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0227">mm mm</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0192">there's no like cycle paths or anything</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0192">erm and also with my classes Monday I've got a long day I'm in from ten until six</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0227">yeah</u>

<u n="1095" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1096" who="S0192">I kind of part of me wished that he's missed his flight or missed a bus or something so it had taught him a lesson but</u>
<u n="1097" who="S0227">he hasn't he's got to instil a discipline</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0192">it will fly for the first year he'll be okay that mentality he'll get through and he'll get an okay grade but come the second yeah and definitely the third year he can't be like that you have to be extremely organised</u>
<u n="1099" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1100" who="S0192">especially once you get to MA level there's no way you could be unorganised</u>
<u n="1101" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="1102" who="S0192">there's absolutely no way</u>
<u n="1103" who="S0227">you're the <trunc>pers</trunc> you're the only person that can tell him I can't tell him your mum can't tell him to up his game cos he'll say what games that?</u>

<u n="1109" who="S0227">but not like you do and he will accept it from you more than me cos he'll say er you've done it so I'm gonna I'd be I'm wise to not take council from you</u>
<u n="1110" who="S0192">my concern I think part of what they test you on in a degree I'm not saying what you're graded on but like with regards to the working world when you get a job you have to you know they they're expecting longevity you get a job they don't want you just changing job every six months every year so</u>
<u n="1111" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="1112" who="S0192">I think half of the reason that a degree is as long as it is is to prove that you can focus on something for that long</u>
<u n="1113" who="S0227">and keep with it</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0192">and keep with it</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0192">and that's where people fail because I've got friends that take it almost right to the wire I've got friends that are doing really well for two and a half years</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0192">and then that last half a year and that worries me with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="1119" who="S0227">yes</u>

<u n="1209" who="S0227">we'll have to put it down to old age my love that's why my</u>
<u n="1210" who="S0192">my short term memory is not great I have to take a lot of notes and that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="1211" who="S0190">I do now especially for dates on the calendar and that</u>
<u n="1212" who="S0192">mm I mean we there's so much technology nowadays that we don't really need to remember certain things you can just</u>
<u n="1213" who="S0190">yeah but then I think that's not good I think you need to</u>
<u n="1214" who="S0227">if it if it goes yeah if <trunc>fai</trunc> bit like you when I'm on a calculator for simple math and then the calculator fails and you're going I don't remember how to do it by paper or mentally yeah so if you are over reliant on</u>
<u n="1215" who="S0192">I mean that's fair those core skills you shouldn't shouldn't really forget</u>
<u n="1216" who="S0227">I think</u>
<u n="1217" who="S0192">but like if I didn't have my laptop all the work that I have to hand in and everything I don't know how I'd keep on top of it I'd just have pile I don't know how people did degrees before this kind of thing I'd just be stacks of paper everywhere</u>
<u n="1218" who="S0227">yes <unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="1219" who="S0190" trans="overlap">yeah that's why I think it's that boring cos everything had to be put on to paper didn't it?</u>
<u n="1220" who="S0192">yeah gosh that would have been tiresome writing a thesis up and then getting it wrong a bit and having to go <vocal desc="laugh"/> rewrite forty thousand words</u>
<u n="1221" who="S0227">read or type it or whatever</u>
<u n="1222" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1223" who="S0227">dum dum dum and then you make mistakes it's like oh god I'm gonna throw it away rather than just delete and</u>
<u n="1224" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1225" who="S0227">cut and paste or nothing</u>
<u n="1226" who="S0192">problem is that people don't back up well enough now so <trunc>peop</trunc> I'm terribly worried about you know later on in the course just losing everything it's gone</u>
<u n="1227" who="S0227"><trunc>b</trunc><trunc>bu</trunc>back it up yeah</u>
<u n="1228" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I'm trying to keep it on the cloud I mean</u>
<u n="1229" who="S0227" trans="overlap">can you put it on can't you put it on the cloud?</u>
<u n="1230" who="S0192">yeah I've got</u>
<u n="1231" who="S0227">well put it on mine as well</u>
<u n="1232" who="S0192">I've got it on a hard drive I've got it on a USB and I've got it on a cloud so</u>
<u n="1233" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1234" who="S0192">hopefully that'll be fine but this cloud so many I can give you a copy as well just incase</u>
<u n="1235" who="S0227">yes that's fine not a problem right I sent her that</u>
<u n="1236" who="S0192">I've got a presentation to give in a couple of weeks on erm</u>
<u n="1237" who="S0227">already?</u>
<u n="1238" who="S0192">I have to give a presentation on Nigerian pidgin phrenology supersegmentals and phonotactics should be interesting</u>
<u n="1239" who="S0227" trans="overlap">good luck with that</u>
<u n="1240" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah I know pidgins and creoles is quite interesting but it's really difficult to study because instead of studying a language I'm studying hundreds of languages and you're trying to work out basically it's about the genesis of pidgins and creoles how were they developed? so not only do you need to understand the lexifier language which would be the super straight so for example English creole or a French creole you kind of need to know a bit of French a bit of Spanish</u>
<u n="1241" who="S0227" trans="overlap">I've heard of French creole but I've never heard of English creole</u>
<u n="1242" who="S0192">I mean erm Nigerian pidgin English Jamaican that's an English creole</u>
<u n="1243" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah yeah man</u>
<u n="1244" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1245" who="S0227">yeah it's creole course it is isn't it? yeah creole</u>
<u n="1246" who="S0192">erm I've been to a couple of places in Nicaragua and Honduras that were er English creoles on the Caribbean coast</u>
<u n="1247" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1248" who="S0192">erm which at the time fascinated me</u>
<u n="1249" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1250" who="S0192">but so you need to know about lexifier languages what gave them their words but then you also need to know about the substrate which are the African languages that</u>
<u n="1251" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1252" who="S0192">give them their grammar and give them all this kind of stuff so it's really quite complex</u>
<u n="1253" who="S0227">I bet it is</u>
<u n="1254" who="S0192">and there's no theory there's no set er <trunc>n</trunc> it's all just</u>
<u n="1255" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1256" who="S0192">you know this is the best idea at the minute but it changes</u>
<u n="1257" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1258" who="S0192">syntax is even heavier</u>
<u n="1259" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1260" who="S0192">doing like as I said it's cognitive science</u>
<u n="1261" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1262" who="S0192">every book's like a six hundred page maths book of like it's it's all about the language faculty and and it's trying to work out language of the mind and like basically do you know Noam Chomsky?</u>
<u n="1263" who="S0227">no</u>
<u n="1264" who="S0192">he revolutionised linguistics and a whole bunch of other departments he's actually the tenth most quoted person in modern books now and the er</u>
<u n="1265" who="S0227" trans="overlap">oh right cos I don't read books I</u>
<u n="1266" who="S0192">the other nine are dead</u>
<u n="1267" who="S0227">right</u>
<u n="1268" who="S0192">in in the top nine are like Plato Aristotle and Chomsky's like</u>
<u n="1269" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1270" who="S0192">in the top ten which must be crazy to feel</u>
<u n="1271" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1272" who="S0192">you know I'm in the top ten of the most <unclear/></u>
<u n="1273" who="S0227">and still alive</u>
<u n="1274" who="S0192">cos basically the behaviourists before that in the fifties were saying that children learn language through positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement from their parents and from their peers</u>
<u n="1275" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1276" who="S0192">but Chomsky turned around and came up with what's called Plato's problem and the poverty of the stimulus where he's saying well how can children produce sentences that they've never heard?</u>
<u n="1277" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1278" who="S0192">it's not possible that they just hear the sentence and thus then regurgitate it</u>
<u n="1279" who="S0227" trans="overlap"><trunc>r</trunc>regurgitate</u>
<u n="1280" who="S0192">and how is it that a child will hear a mistake yet know that it's a mistake?</u>
<u n="1281" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1282" who="S0192">you'd think that they'd replicate the mistakes</u>
<u n="1283" who="S0227"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1284" who="S0192">these kind of things so since this the fifties sixties it's exploded and it's just gone on and they've been trying to make and they've worked out that the're are <trunc>pro</trunc> there are what's called universal grammar theories there are parameters that basically the child sets so for example null subject in English we have to have the subject we have to say I play</u>
<u n="1285" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1286" who="S0192">but in Spanish they have a null subject language</u>
<u n="1287" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1288" who="S0192">because the inflection <foreign lang="spa">hablo</foreign> I speak</u>
<u n="1289" who="S0227"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1290" who="S0192">you don't need to say <foreign lang="spa">yo hablo</foreign></u>
<u n="1291" who="S0227">yeah you don't have to emphasise the er the the the I yeah</u>
<u n="1292" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah so there's lots of these parameters and they found that all these parameters are binary it's either the language is that or the other and there's like a list of different parameters and basically the last fifty years they've been finding the core parameters but but again it's all theory</u>
<u n="1293" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1294" who="S0192">and it's really difficult to prove so</u>
<u n="1295" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1296" who="S0192">and the problem with it is that it started off as transformational theory and then moved on to principles and parameters it then in the eighties and nineties was called government and binding theory now it's called the minimalist programme they keep changing it because the the theory's developing so</u>
<u n="1297" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1298" who="S0192">trying to learn about all this is a bit you know there's like</u>
<u n="1299" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1300" who="S0192">so many theories to try and get through before you actually get to the core of it</u>
<u n="1301" who="S0227">good luck <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1302" who="S0192">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> I know the problem I was thinking</u>
<u n="1303" who="S0227"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1304" who="S0192">as well how do I apply this in the classroom? you know</u>
<u n="1305" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1306" who="S0192">how am I gonna use this knowledge?</u>
<u n="1307" who="S0227">yes plenty with those who who there <trunc>w</trunc> who are willing subjects to learn <trunc>rath</trunc> you'd wanna be teaching people who want to be there not people who have been forced to be there</u>
<u n="1308" who="S0192">no yeah of course</u>
<u n="1309" who="S0227">cos if they're forced to be there you'll be going this I'm never gonna impart this to these people</u>
<u n="1310" who="S0192">but I mean mine and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s ultimate goal we don't wanna be teaching English language we wanna be teaching linguistics</u>
<u n="1311" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1312" who="S0192">for the future but er we you know we need to have a PHD before we can be doing that so that's a long way off</u>
<u n="1313" who="S0227"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1314" who="S0192">it may never happen <unclear>but</unclear></u>
<u n="1315" who="S0227"><unclear/> well yeah</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0192"><unclear/> try</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0227">you've gotta get your master's first get get a get a job do PHD part time if you can</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0192">I mean we may do <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I have seriously considered trying to go to America or Canada to do a PHD because it's easier to get funding as a foreign student than it is as an as a native student</u>
<u n="1319" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1320" who="S0192">more more people get funding when they cos the the university it's good for the university to have foreign students so they fund people to come into the university</u>
<u n="1321" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0192">it would also be a way of getting our foot in the door with another country</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0227">yeah but would it pay for your like your accommodation and <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0192">funding would if we got the correct funding</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0192">would cover everything</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0192">they can fund people up to fifteen to twenty thousand pound a year for four years <unclear/></u>
<u n="1329" who="S0227" trans="overlap">er well I would definitely go in two off two prongs at the same time I'd be trying to look for work and seeing if I could do this</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0227">rather than just relying on one <unclear/> relying on the PHD</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no I mean our plan our plan after this is to go and work in the Middle East and save up the money so that we have enough money to self-fund ourselves</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0192">and then if we get funding then we can just save that money we don't need to do it</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0192">but <unclear/></u>
<u n="1337" who="S0227">I'm gonna get changed I suppose we're too early to go for the role call of thank yous isn't it? phoning people up</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0190">yeah my dad won't be home I don't think</u>

<u n="1565" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1566" who="S0192">I mean it was a bit cheeky but at the same time I think she was probably thinking I'm seeing <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the day after so</u>
<u n="1567" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah she probably doesn't realise it herself I mean or or she does I don't know erm</u>

<u n="1569" who="S0227" trans="overlap">but I said I I I'm not I don't have the emotional all those emotionals that it that she has that and feel upset and things like that no</u>

<u n="1571" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah but I'm I she's a much tougher <unclear/> than me cos I'll just say er er okay fine whatever and like I said I put in a thing I put I wanted to emphasise to you that erm what I said was tongue in cheek so I put you a big smiley face on it</u>
<u n="1572" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah I saw that</u>

<u n="1577" who="S0192">yeah so erm and as as will <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he'll have more time off than I will cos he won't he might have a mid-year assessment period maybe but</u>
<u n="1578" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1579" who="S0192">erm university gives you a fair bit of time off undergraduate</u>
<u n="1580" who="S0190">well yes because the idea is you get a bit of a job if possible doesn't it?</u>
<u n="1581" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1582" who="S0190">erm especially at <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s age group to sort of help fund some of the things you might need to do</u>
<u n="1583" who="S0192">mm so yeah I'll finish on the twelfth and then I'm just I mean what you were saying is correct about like my studying but I think because it's not coursework because I've just got exams if I came home for a few extra days I think I could study here I might just have to go and lock myself in the room and do it everything should be on my laptop really I should have done everything by that point I just have to study</u>
<u n="1584" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1585" who="S0192">I just have to keep reading about it and making sure that I I I follow it so I think I'll be fine <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="1586" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1587" who="S0192">but he should finish around about mid-December I would say erm it's gonna come round quickly isn't it? really really quick</u>
<u n="1588" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes it will do it's ninety days</u>
<u n="1589" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it's already October next week</u>
<u n="1590" who="S0227">ninety days till Christmas</u>

<u n="1592" who="S0227" trans="overlap">just do the math boom straight</u>
<u n="1593" who="S0192" trans="overlap">straight answer ninety days</u>
<u n="1594" who="S0227">ninety days erm it erm with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I will speak to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> when I see him next Friday I will erm try and stitch him if <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s coming home is there any work? cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s been left his key fob and everything and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has left a back door he's got I'm hoping he's got a revolving door policy with them</u>
<u n="1595" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1596" who="S0227">erm</u>
<u n="1597" who="S0192">I mean he should do if he's always got work that needs to be done</u>
<u n="1598" who="S0227" trans="overlap">he's got work that is the slight <unclear>break</unclear> for him not to go erm to her</u>
<u n="1599" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1600" who="S0227">but the other break <unclear>hole</unclear> kind of be more on system is going good idea if you can afford it but make sure you've done your assignments before you go don't be trying to fit everything in when you get back</u>
<u n="1601" who="S0192">I'm a bit concerned with how he's viewing his finances in general he's given me a very kind of blasé</u>
<u n="1602" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1603" who="S0192">you know I'm being lent so much money that it doesn't really matter I might as well just spend it and I keep trying to say to him if somebody had told me at the beginning</u>
<u n="1604" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1605" who="S0192">take the money don't spend it stick it in an ISA <vocal desc="laugh"/> come out of your degree with more money than you started with or at least only spend a portion of the money</u>
<u n="1606" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1607" who="S0192">whereas undergraduates just feel like hey I've got this money where did it come from? like they just spend it</u>
<u n="1608" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1609" who="S0192">and then you think oh and I mean I've still got fifteen thousand he's gonna come out with closer to thirty to fifty thousand so</u>
<u n="1610" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1611" who="S0192">if he takes the full amount which he keeps talking like that's what he's going to do and I'm like well no take the minimum you don't need to er to take</u>
<u n="1612" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="1613" who="S0192">I guess if he's never gonna have to pay it back then</u>
<u n="1614" who="S0227" trans="overlap">he should he should seek your wise council because there is no substitute for experience I said when I say to him erm about what he's going to and stuff like this it's like with the freshers' week I said I talk as though I've been on this I don't I only know from what I've heard and have a good time blah blah blah you know this is where where you your getting to know people and and the way it works and stuff like that and then you knuckle down erm I said but apart from that I I can't give you any experience er any advice because I've never done this before erm so I'm hoping that he will actually listen to you and seek your council because you've done it you've made the mistakes you know where the where the pitfalls are and you can spare him from doing these sort of things as so so if he wants to go and see <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> erm at Christmas not a problem as long as he makes sure that if he's got any assignments they are all done before he goes not trying to fit them in and just fudge erm erm</u>
<u n="1615" who="S0190">yeah but you'll probably find he won't he he's more chance that he might go early because the flights'll be that much cheaper if he leaves it right on top of Christmas</u>
<u n="1616" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1617" who="S0190">it's gonna cost a fortune to go out there</u>
<u n="1618" who="S0192">that's true</u>
<u n="1619" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1620" who="S0190">so he might sort of say if he goes soon as he finishes he can perhaps have what? anything like a good ten days out there</u>
<u n="1621" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1622" who="S0190">erm and sort of you know come back just as everybody else is going so it doesn't cost him quite as much money</u>
<u n="1623" who="S0192">I think that would be a better idea as soon as he</u>
<u n="1624" who="S0190" trans="overlap">then he can sit down and study</u>
<u n="1625" who="S0192">as soon as the course finishes go out for a week or so come back for Christmas and</u>
<u n="1626" who="S0190">that's it and then you've got some time to finish your studies</u>
<u n="1627" who="S0192">it really depends on his <unclear/></u>
<u n="1628" who="S0227" trans="overlap">it'd keep your mum happy as long as that's when she wants him out there</u>
<u n="1629" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1630" who="S0227">she might want him at Christmas are you with me?</u>
<u n="1631" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1632" who="S0227">and then he's going to definitely</u>
<u n="1633" who="S0190">but you don't get what you want do you all the time?</u>
<u n="1634" who="S0227">er</u>
<u n="1635" who="S0190">you just have to</u>
<u n="1636" who="S0227">no but</u>
<u n="1637" who="S0190">so wait and see</u>
<u n="1638" who="S0227">I think he if he's going to disappoint me your mother or <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I think erm your mother and I will be a distant second and third to that I would if I was him and that's the trouble <vocal desc="laugh"/> that's the problem</u>
<u n="1639" who="S0192">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1640" who="S0227">so erm yeah so I mean</u>
<u n="1641" who="S0190">yeah but you look at it I'm not being funny he he's had and don't take this the wrong way he's had Christmases that haven't really been anything brilliant for the last two or three years because he's been on his own and an awful lot of that time there at Christmas so if he's got a chance to have a fun Christmas then surely that</u>
<u n="1642" who="S0227" trans="overlap">I would go for well</u>
<u n="1643" who="S0190">well you'd go for that wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="1644" who="S0192">I feel quite guilty to be honest with you but</u>
<u n="1645" who="S0227" trans="overlap">it trumps every time I said the only thing I'd say is if he's going at Christmas make sure that before that you go you've done everything it's it's nothing for you to come home to</u>
<u n="1646" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1647" who="S0227">it's all done you're not smart enough to be able to go there and then do this</u>
<u n="1648" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/> hopefully his workload in the first semester won't be too heavy</u>
<u n="1649" who="S0227">won't be too heavy</u>
<u n="1650" who="S0192">er</u>
<u n="1651" who="S0227">but I mean I fear that science</u>
<u n="1652" who="S0192">it's going to be that I mean the <anon type="place"/> is a top twenty thirty uni same as <anon type="place"/> they're gonna expect more than I had to do at <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="1653" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1654" who="S0192">so er</u>
<u n="1655" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1656" who="S0192">erm</u>
<u n="1657" who="S0227">I can't help him</u>
<u n="1658" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="1659" who="S0227">I gave him some money boom boom that's it erm</u>
<u n="1660" who="S0192">I just hope he uses his money wisely he <trunc>need</trunc> I I know he's got some extra money because he did well in his access course so that's good and he one thing that he can do that I couldn't do which is the whole reason I took a year out I wanted to be self assessed</u>
<u n="1661" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1662" who="S0192">I was knowing that you know if you guys are assessed or mum and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> were assessed I wasn't gonna get any help</u>
<u n="1663" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1664" who="S0192">and I purposefully took a year out but only found out in hindsight that you had to have been living on your own for three years not for one year</u>
<u n="1665" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1666" who="S0192">erm and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has been living on his own effectively</u>

<u n="1668" who="S0192">he's okay he's currently been living with mum but as far as apparently they're concerned he's been working so he's a mature student so</u>
<u n="1669" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1670" who="S0192">he will get more help because he's been assessed but he also seems to wanna take all of the money and and the impression he's given me is</u>
<u n="1671" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1672" who="S0192">just it's free money and I can just kind of spend it</u>
<u n="1673" who="S0227" trans="overlap">it's not oh it's not free he'll end up having to pay a bit or or erm keep servicing the erm the interest without any of the equity and that could cost him an absolute fortune over over</u>
<u n="1674" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I think he'll</u>
<u n="1675" who="S0227">his working life</u>
<u n="1676" who="S0192">I think he'll go travelling over the summer again I think he's got the bug a little bit now</u>
<u n="1677" who="S0227" trans="overlap">he's got he's got the bug yeah I just wish I said about the girls and that's easy for me to say but I said focus on the mission girls that will all come later but sometimes people want everything now especially</u>

<u n="1746" who="S0227">he needs constant pushing because if he doesn't he slow he slides back into himself I think</u>
<u n="1747" who="S0190">he's so used to spending time on his own and that isn't he?</u>
<u n="1748" who="S0227">I</u>

<u n="1756" who="S0192">mm</u>

<u n="1758" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1759" who="S0190">and he he so that you can't just keep going to places to try and find somebody as if you're on the <trunc>lo</trunc> but he hadn't even got any male friends because they'd all gone different ways</u>
<u n="1760" who="S0227">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and that had</u>
<u n="1761" who="S0192"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> went to Saint Albans didn't he?</u>
<u n="1762" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well their own <trunc>relat</trunc> they've got their own relationships that's that thing is if you see people in couples cos you're couples er although your single friends it it becomes a bit difficult erm</u>
<u n="1763" who="S0192">definitely</u>
<u n="1764" who="S0227">erm because your friend is still in a relationship and he's going well I can see you like every now and again but like I can't be seeing you four or five times a week</u>
<u n="1765" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="1766" who="S0227">because I'm in a relationship I can't do that I think with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s he has a tendency he realises that he now I think he's categorised his his childhood as not being a very nice one</u>
<u n="1767" who="S0192">yeah he has</u>
<u n="1768" who="S0227">and I think he blames your mum for it</u>

<u n="1770" who="S0227">now she has to have some put her hands up to some of it and I have to put my hand up to some of it as well</u>
<u n="1771" who="S0192">no I mean</u>
<u n="1772" who="S0227">but it's not all down to that but I think he focuses I think he probably blames her a lot more than he blames me because she is the architect but I still must put my hand up to an extent but so that</u>
<u n="1773" who="S0192" trans="overlap">no he was quite brutally honest with me when he was out there and I kinda had to say to him yes obviously as you're saying mum made mistakes</u>
<u n="1774" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1775" who="S0192">but you can't say she didn't try to be a good mother she</u>
<u n="1776" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1777" who="S0192">may have made lots of mistakes throughout the years but she clearly put effort in to be a good mum it he's kinda yeah what you're saying is just given a blanket impression of how his childhood was</u>
<u n="1778" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="1779" who="S0192">and I said well prior to this happening you know we had a good time we were pretty happy</u>
<u n="1780" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1781" who="S0192">erm and he could have reacted differently</u>
<u n="1782" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1783" who="S0192">to the whole thing ah it's difficult because he was young wasn't he? so he he didn't have the option that I did to to get out of the scenario</u>
<u n="1784" who="S0227" trans="overlap">yeah he was ten he was ten</u>
<u n="1785" who="S0192">he was stuck in it and that I feel quite guilty about</u>

<u n="1787" who="S0192">erm</u>
<u n="1788" who="S0227">but er</u>

<u n="1790" who="S0227">well yeah</u>
<u n="1791" who="S0192">cos it's a lot of money to do</u>
<u n="1792" who="S0227">yes and I hope he doesn't blow a fortune in erm I don't care how much money er the first care is I don't care how much money he blows in its acquisition</u>

<u n="1796" who="S0227">and he doesn't drop out I mean I will not be happy with him after this that he gave up a job that wasn't you know it wasn't the best job in the world but there's a hell of a lot of worse jobs in and it was something that he was good at it was on his doorstep erm and he could have networked into something else rather than I admire him for giving it up and doing this but he must stick through it you know</u>
<u n="1797" who="S0192">I mean if he drops out because he has love interests or he can't be bothered</u>
<u n="1798" who="S0227" trans="overlap">oh I'd be incandescent with with displeasure</u>

<u n="1811" who="S0192">twenty thousand pounds but you've got nothing</u>
<u n="1812" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well this is this is that's this is where your wise council comes in that you know I I've said to him look you're on a mission now the mission is to get that degree you go from here to here ba ba ba and you get it and this will then enable you to do what you wanna do if you wanna travel well you'd better get a job you'll be able to travel blah blah blah</u>
<u n="1813" who="S0192">I've been trying to get him to think about postgraduate going on to do a masters cos if he does well in his degree</u>
<u n="1814" who="S0227">yeah one step at a time</u>
<u n="1815" who="S0192">I know but</u>
<u n="1816" who="S0227">give him one step at cos otherwise I he might be daunted by</u>
<u n="1817" who="S0192">but it gives him a reason to get that</u>
<u n="1818" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1819" who="S0192">if he can see why he needs this to do the next thing</u>
<u n="1820" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1821" who="S0192">if he's thinking well what is the next thing? I don't need this then it's a problem so</u>
<u n="1822" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well <trunc>ho</trunc>hopefully I'm hoping his work placement might give him a a an experience and a job and cos I think he does have a mission as in what type of job he wants to do if he</u>
<u n="1823" who="S0192">he wants money as well</u>
<u n="1824" who="S0227">he wants he wasn't the <trunc>mone</trunc></u>
<u n="1825" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1826" who="S0227">he wants basically there is</u>
<u n="1827" who="S0192">he wants a comfortable lifestyle</u>
<u n="1828" who="S0227">in relation of you that he wants he's seen you go erm holidaying a lot and travelling and he wants this as well but he needs to have a trouble is your line of work gives you longer holidays</u>
<u n="1829" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1830" who="S0227">his line of work will give him four week if he moved to America if he wanted a job in America er most of them get about a week off</u>
<u n="1831" who="S0192">yeah it's terrible isn't it? yeah</u>
<u n="1832" who="S0227" trans="overlap">know this so erm erm in the UK he'll get a job that'll give him four or five or even six weeks off but that doesn't give him that range of what you had you know? he could travel in those times but</u>
<u n="1833" who="S0192">well I chose a field because I wanted to travel and it was a combination of travel and work so I found something</u>
<u n="1834" who="S0227" trans="overlap">and you're able to ply your trade where you've travelled</u>
<u n="1835" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="1836" who="S0227">so it's all you know you're at work but you're almost on holiday at the same time cos you this is not the country of your birth you know I am somewhere else</u>
<u n="1837" who="S0192">yeah still feels like travelling</u>
<u n="1838" who="S0227">so</u>
<u n="1839" who="S0192">definitely feels like work though</u>
<u n="1840" who="S0227">it now yes</u>
<u n="1841" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it doesn't quite feel like a holiday</u>
<u n="1842" who="S0227">this now feels like more work because you're in the land of your birth and you're working there's okay you're not in <anon type="place"/> that would be a real stretch on your imagination of trying to romanticise it at least with Brighton you can say oh we're by the sea and it's south of England it's not here or like so it's it's it's not as good as being abroad er but it's better than being in <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="1843" who="S0192">without we wanted to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I really really wanted I think we told you</u>
<u n="1844" who="S0227">yes you did</u>
<u n="1845" who="S0192">we wanted to go to the Netherlands</u>
<u n="1846" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1847" who="S0192">or even Scotland</u>
<u n="1848" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1849" who="S0192">but cos we want we wanted to be close we wanted to be able to see family this year and have the money that we could you know every month come back home and do that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="1850" who="S0227">yeah</u>
<u n="1851" who="S0192">but it just wouldn't work they there's the myopic that you must have your degree from a native English-speaking country</u>
<u n="1852" who="S0227">yes</u>
<u n="1853" who="S0192">even though it's a top one hundred world university even though it's bilingual</u>
<u n="1854" who="S0227">give them what they want cos if it opens more doors that's that's that's what you have to do</u>
<u n="1855" who="S0192">cost a lot more though</u>
<u n="1856" who="S0227">the ends justifies the means</u>
<u n="1857" who="S0192">pretty sure that rule is there because these English-speaking universities have set that rule</u>
<u n="1858" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well well</u>
<u n="1859" who="S0192">so that we continue to come to the English-speaking universities yeah</u>
<u n="1860" who="S0227" trans="overlap">well wouldn't you?</u>
<u n="1861" who="S0192">oh yeah definitely</u>
<u n="1862" who="S0227">yes if you can monopolise something and contain it or control it you that's what you do no one wants to lose control of something that they find precious but I think by the sounds of it</u>
<u n="1863" who="S0192" trans="overlap">how's <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> doing now he's moved in? has he settled?</u>

<u n="1867" who="S0227">mm</u>
<u n="1868" who="S0190">literally and said oh I'm not doing that I'm not doing it</u>

<u n="1950" who="S0190">so we loaded the car full and bless him when we got up there he's got open at the back and he's trying to clear all the rubbish up that they've got had left all the old carpet and everything so there's hey don't come and bring any rubbish up here so I said we're not bringing rubbish as far as we're concerned</u>
<u n="1951" who="S0192">it's your stuff <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1952" who="S0190">it's your stuff it's up to you now to decide what you wanna do with it</u>
<u n="1953" who="S0192"><vocal desc="laugh"/> it's going in your house</u>
<u n="1954" who="S0190">so erm</u>
<u n="1955" who="S0192">so this is a mortgage this place isn't it?</u>
<u n="1956" who="S0190">pardon?</u>
<u n="1957" who="S0192">this is it's mortgaged?</u>
<u n="1958" who="S0190" trans="overlap">oh yes <unclear/> buying it yeah it's theirs</u>
<u n="1959" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah so oh that's a big move isn't it? getting your first mortgage</u>
<u n="1960" who="S0190">it is a big move but like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said if you look at the comparison of what you're paying for a something that is very</u>
<u n="1961" who="S0192" trans="overlap"><unclear/> isn't it? from what I've heard</u>
<u n="1962" who="S0190">yeah I mean it is he he's done very very well he <trunc>ha</trunc> he's taken a very small mortgage to compare to what they offered him</u>
<u n="1963" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="1964" who="S0190">erm and that so he was doing a lot better off having this mortgage than he did when he rented the place and it's his</u>
<u n="1965" who="S0192" trans="overlap">it's so much better than money down the drain isn't it?</u>
<u n="1966" who="S0190" trans="overlap">oh gosh yeah definitely</u>
<u n="1967" who="S0192">every month just nothing <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I are just oh I don't know how we'd ever get on the property but er</u>
<u n="1968" who="S0190">well I'm sure you will when if if you get to the stage where you passed all your exams and things there's no reason why you shouldn't have a semi decent job</u>
<u n="1969" who="S0192">no I mean I guess</u>
<u n="1970" who="S0190">so therefore you'll have the money to think about</u>
<u n="1971" who="S0192" trans="overlap">yeah I guess if we stop putting the money on education or travel then maybe we could save</u>
<u n="1972" who="S0190" trans="overlap">that's right</u>
<u n="1973" who="S0192">but we haven't really been earning very much although I've been able to save a bit we've only been on about fourteen thousand pounds in South Korea so it's not actually a lot of money it's just that we we</u>
<u n="1974" who="S0227">although your bills are paid aren't they?</u>
<u n="1975" who="S0192">yeah the bills are covered and the rents covered so it kind of and then the cost of living's cheaper so that kind of keeps keeps going up but when you actually take it for what it is to get I mean how much do you have to put down on a mortgage maybe thirty thousand?</u>
<u n="1976" who="S0190" trans="overlap">five percent depends on the property doesn't it?</u>
<u n="1977" who="S0192">yeah it completely varies</u>
<u n="1978" who="S0190">so yeah</u>
<u n="1979" who="S0192">but then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I would have to be very settled wouldn't we to be able to do that as well unless you just mortgaged it and then rented it immediately to somebody else I can't see how we'd be able to do it</u>
<u n="1980" who="S0190" trans="overlap">well you can</u>
<u n="1981" who="S0192">and I feel a bit bad doing that to somebody else making somebody else pay my mortgage</u>
<u n="1982" who="S0190">why?</u>
<u n="1983" who="S0192">while they live there</u>
<u n="1984" who="S0190">because it gives them a home</u>
<u n="1985" who="S0192">it does but</u>
<u n="1986" who="S0190">give somebody else a home a chance that they probably can't if <unclear/> any other way there just aren't the amount of houses at the moment are there?</u>
<u n="1987" who="S0192">I just feel like that's kind of half the problem with why rent's so high in the UK if people just didn't you know you get one guy that owns twenty houses then he's like well I I own it all so I'll just put the rent up and I just I don't know</u>
<u n="1988" who="S0190">I do well the thing that annoys me more than anything is that if you drive around and have a look in quite there's quite a few places just boarded up where people have bought the property when it was good</u>
<u n="1989" who="S0192" trans="overlap">oh yeah oh yeah</u>
<u n="1990" who="S0190">and to put sink their money into and now they're well there's people want homes you should only be allowed to hold a house for so long with like living in it or renting it</u>
<u n="1991" who="S0192">yeah I mean there are enough houses for everyone</u>
<u n="1992" who="S0190">there are</u>
<u n="1993" who="S0192">there are there's not a shortage of houses erm I I personally am of the belief this is again slightly ethical issues my own belief I don't think we should be able to own more than two houses I don't I think it would solve quite a few problems it would stop having so many people needing to rent if you just said look why do you need more than your main home and perhaps a summer home somewhere else do you really need to own more than that? I mean I guess most people don't but some some people do</u>
<u n="1994" who="S0190" trans="overlap">but you see if they're property developers and doing this they need to own them to rent them out don't they? to make the money to go on to do the next one</u>
<u n="1995" who="S0192">yeah to do more</u>
<u n="1996" who="S0190">and there's the people that don't do it want to sort of invest money into the property</u>
<u n="1997" who="S0192">I mean I understand for new houses but it gets me when you're talking thinking about an old house that's been paid for twenty times over and yet people are still paying for the same bricks and mortar that were were built a hundred years ago a hundred and fifty years ago</u>
<u n="1998" who="S0190" trans="overlap">yeah but the more that the the older the property the more you're taking on</u>
<u n="1999" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="2000" who="S0190">because the bills it's like now dad's having to</u>
<u n="2001" who="S0192">the insulations not so good</u>
<u n="2002" who="S0190">that's right that er the roofing is like that the windows the heating</u>
<u n="2003" who="S0192" trans="overlap">things break the maintenance</u>
<u n="2004" who="S0190">the boilers it costs you far more to run an older house than I mean it doesn't cost much my dad as much to run his five-bedroomed house and that as it does to us to run this</u>
<u n="2005" who="S0192">I mean I'm a bit of socialist really I think probably at heart I would say we all own all of the houses you apply to move house and we all put in a little bit of month into a pot that means that your house is maintained by some external company where we don't even need to extend</u>
<u n="2006" who="S0190" trans="overlap">no no I I er I don't know</u>
<u n="2007" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I mean that's fine</u>
<u n="2008" who="S0190">I'm so <unclear/> possessions</u>
<u n="2009" who="S0192">and and that's why people that's why it isn't like that cos most people agree</u>
<u n="2010" who="S0190" trans="overlap">yeah but you see it's everybody's got a different outlook haven't they?</u>
<u n="2011" who="S0192">yeah</u>
<u n="2012" who="S0190">if you think how many <trunc>p</trunc>places that people just trash absolutely trash them</u>
<u n="2013" who="S0192" trans="overlap">I mean effectively it would be yours in this scenario you would be under no pressure to move nobody can force you out it's your house but if you want to move you just er you just look at all the available houses kind of like a house swap do you know what I mean? you just swap houses you don't really oh you can change it you can modify it because it's yours while you're living there but you don't sell it as such it's you don't have the money from it you just move to another house so you apply that's the system that I'm kind of imagining to a certain degree so the house this would still be yours and if you wanted to live here for you know forever you can do that but if you decide well you know I wanna see what it's like in Devon you could go on a website and see who is wanting to move out of Devon and then just kind of swap</u>
<u n="2014" who="S0190" trans="overlap">but you can do that can't you now?</u>
<u n="2015" who="S0192">you can yeah to a certain degree</u>
<u n="2016" who="S0190" trans="overlap">I wouldn't I wouldn't wanna leave somebody in my house <unclear/> back</u>
<u n="2017" who="S0192">but I'm talking about an all encompassing system</u>
<u n="2018" who="S0190">for everybody yeah</u>
<u n="2019" who="S0192" trans="overlap">where everyone and then maintenance is kind of more of an external thing you don't need if something breaks in your house if effectively it just comes out of taxes if you're like this is broken then it just you know some company comes round a government agency and fixes it rather than you having to do that yourself cos you get people as well that I had a friend that got a mortgage and he had their house flooded in America and he's just got the house and then the house flooded like there was a freak weather accident in in Nashville or Tennessee and just lumped them with masses and masses of debt just</u>
<u n="2020" who="S0190">mm</u>
<u n="2021" who="S0192">they weren't to know that that was going to happen it seemed very unfortunate</u>
<u n="2022" who="S0190" trans="overlap">well my friend exactly the same she lives in Wellingborough and erm she's just moved in with her partner now and he daughter's been living in her house that she had that she split with her husband and she managed to get a property of her own and er one day her daughter <unclear>rang</unclear> up mum you're gonna have to come over and sort this water out there's so much water cos think oh yeah with the rain then she goes oh gosh mum if you don't come and sort this out it's going it's nearly up to the conservatory you're having and the long and the short of it is that basically <trunc>some</trunc>somebody has done some work or some building they've erm done it on the er the floodplains</u>
<u n="2023" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="2024" who="S0190">there's a and then what they've done they've disturbed a spring and so she's having to pay for a pump to pump out the water on to the street</u>
<u n="2025" who="S0192">why's that her responsibility?</u>
<u n="2026" who="S0190">because it's her house and her property</u>
<u n="2027" who="S0192" trans="overlap">but someone else yeah but but but ethically should it be? if somebody else has made <unclear/></u>
<u n="2028" who="S0190" trans="overlap">so she just well this is what she said it's not mine I didn't take this or nobody warned me of this</u>
<u n="2029" who="S0192">no</u>
<u n="2030" who="S0190">it was all you know fine when we moved in and I think this somebody has done something to unsettle it and so of course she what can I do? nobody's gonna buy it are they? cos no nobody'll take hands put their hands up and say it's our fault we'll sort it nobody'll do it she's got to do it herself it's gonna cost thousands thousands</u>
<u n="2031" who="S0192">it's no good is it?</u>
<u n="2032" who="S0190">it isn't</u>
<u n="2033" who="S0192">never a problem in <trunc>Chi</trunc> Korea and China is phenomenal how many vacant properties there are I mean they don't build properties like we do there's a lot of high rise buildings but China especially they can't they're not allowed to take large sums of money out of the country so rich people within China are investing in property so they're just building new tower blocks everywhere and it's crazy you go there's just literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of massive tower blocks with nobody in them there's no one there and it really got to me in Mokpo because when I was living in Korea there's so few homeless people really are compared to England there's so few I mean the whole of Mokpo I only ever saw one and it was sadder for me because he's alone he he didn't have a community of homeless people it was just him and I look around and see all these vacant flats and think why can't he just have one you know? why why is he I think he died that winter to tell you <unclear>honestly</unclear> cos I never saw him again after that but</u>
<u n="2034" who="S0190">mm</u>
<u n="2035" who="S0192">he was like you know shoes are falling he's got string tied around his shoes and stuff kind of guy just hold his sole on to the bottom of his shoe and like he didn't beg no one gave him money or anything like that he just would just walk around town and like just sit in the corner couldn't they don't really have homeless people so when they do have one or two they just slip through nothing there's nothing there to help them</u>
<u n="2036" who="S0190">so how do they survive?</u>
<u n="2037" who="S0192">I he looked like he'd been on the street for a while maybe he moved on maybe he was a bit of a vagrant and moved on but I don't know I don't know how he survived I saw him quite a lot I felt I really wanted because at the time I felt terrible because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I were allotted an apartment each but we only were using one and I had a whole <trunc>sp</trunc> I was so close to just going to the guy but then I was like I'm responsible for this apartment</u>
<u n="2038" who="S0190">mm once in you can't <unclear/> mm</u>
<u n="2039" who="S0192" trans="overlap">if he goes in there and destroys it you know I can't you know I'm responsible for that but it pained me to see him every day and to think there are so many places where you could put a roof over your head</u>
<u n="2040" who="S0190">but why was he homeless?</u>
<u n="2041" who="S0192">I don't know</u>
<u n="2042" who="S0190">this is the thing isn't it? you've got to look at the overall picture and think you know some people genuinely need the help to sort themselves out to do this</u>
<u n="2043" who="S0192">mm</u>
<u n="2044" who="S0190">and others have put themselves in the position themselves</u>
<u n="2045" who="S0192">I mean it wouldn't be I mean in England we have a problem like people take drugs or something and we think you know you've got there that's your problem you've done it it wouldn't have been that in Korea you don't have access to them they just aren't there so it wouldn't have been drugs could have been alcohol I guess which is a drug erm but he didn't really look like an alcoholic I don't know he struck me as like the type of person who just had no family and they're very family oriented</u>
<u n="2046" who="S0190">mm</u>
<u n="2047" who="S0192">and I feel like if you have no family you're just on your own I don't know if you they don't really talk to people you can't really have friends with people that aren't your age either which is very strange so the usually people's best friends are the same age as them and usually the same sex so if he if he just didn't know anyone just had no family <event desc="sound of phone"/> I just I don't know</u>
