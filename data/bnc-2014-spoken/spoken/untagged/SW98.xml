<u n="27" who="S0018">oh dear</u>
<u n="28" who="S0002">probably I have to pay until June</u>
<u n="29" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="30" who="S0018">how much is it?</u>
<u n="31" who="S0002">three hundred no yeah including bills and internet and everything it's three hundred and ten per month</u>
<u n="32" who="S0018">that's not too bad with bills and stuff</u>
<u n="33" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's just like <trunc>t</trunc> two minutes down the road</u>
<u n="34" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="35" who="S0002">so it's really close</u>
<u n="36" who="S0018">perfect</u>
<u n="37" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> sort of roll out of the bed and go to the school in the morning</u>
<u n="38" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> And is it a small place? It's er what what was it that about the other place that you didn't like? Or was it just the price?</u>
<u n="39" who="S0002">do you you know where <anon type="place"/> is?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="41" who="S0002">it's it was there</u>
<u n="42" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="43" who="S0002">um and that considering it was five hundred and fifty per month</u>
<u n="44" who="S0018">oh right</u>
<u n="45" who="S0002">um</u>
<u n="46" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="47" who="S0002"><trunc>Othe</trunc></u>
<u n="48" who="S0018">that was a lot more expensive</u>
<u n="49" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was a lot of money <pause dur="short"/> but she was quite flexible about when I could so I she said I could um leave after three months</u>
<u n="50" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0002">which would've been better <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so I probably should've done that <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="52" who="S0018">what happens if you break your contract? Have you given them a deposit?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0002">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> they've got a deposit</u>
<u n="54" who="S0018">I mean that's</u>
<u n="55" who="S0002">I don't actually know <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't it says that you have to complete the full contract <pause dur="short"/> I believe there's no like get-out clause <pause dur="short"/> like give one month's notice and you can leave <pause dur="short"/> as far as I can see <pause dur="short"/> they told me at the beginning if I can find someone else to replace me then I can break the contract</u>
<u n="56" who="S0018">SE hmm</u>
<u n="57" who="S0002">but that's quite hard</u>
<u n="58" who="S0018">and how many months er rent do they have from you for <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="59" who="S0002">one month's</u>
<u n="60" who="S0018">as a deposit?</u>
<u n="61" who="S0002">deposit <pause dur="short"/> but actually um huh we're thinking of pushing legal action against the landlord because er for the last three months we haven't had any well not we haven't had any but we've had major problems with the boiler</u>
<u n="62" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0002">so we've been days sometimes weeks without hot water and heating <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I've been going home to my mum and dad's for showers</u>
<u n="64" who="S0018">oh no</u>
<u n="65" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know <pause dur="short"/> and every time we say every time well we must they we must have had British Gas come round about fifteen times this year</u>
<u n="66" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="67" who="S0002">and they're still not replacing the boiler <pause dur="short"/> and that's just one of the problems <pause dur="short"/> there's been tons of problems <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="68" who="S0018">why don't you just refuse to pay your rent until he sorts it out?</u>
<u n="69" who="S0002">so we've that's what we've now said that we're gonna do <pause dur="short"/> but it has to be all of us <pause dur="short"/> we have to all do the same thing <pause dur="short"/> if we don't then it's yeah we don't want them to er huh the thing is we get yelled at every time we say look we're not paying until until it's all fixed <pause dur="short"/> they make us feel like we're completely unreasonable <pause dur="short"/> which I know we shouldn't get talked round in er these things but</u>
<u n="70" who="S0018">is it a private landlord? Or?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0002">no it's <trunc>ra</trunc> it's through an agency</u>
<u n="72" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0002">and the agency won't hear of us not paying <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="74" who="S0018">yeah but I mean at the end of the day if they're not it could be a way of getting out of your contract</u>
<u n="75" who="S0002">that's this so in January when it was really bad over Christmas <pause dur="short"/> actually I got really ill because</u>
<u n="76" who="S0018">oh no</u>
<u n="77" who="S0002">there was a week that there was cold water <pause dur="short"/> and it was cold at Christmas <pause dur="short"/> and um I went I came to the university <pause dur="short"/> first I went to my faculty kind of adviser and said look I'm having these problems <pause dur="short"/> I wanna know if I can break the contract <pause dur="short"/> because I don't see why I should be paying considering it's <trunc>unliv</trunc> it's like uninhabitable literally <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="78" who="S0018">it was so cold as well wasn't it</u>
<u n="79" who="S0002">it was freezing <pause dur="short"/> um and they said that there's nothing they can do <pause dur="short"/> so then I went to the university housing <pause dur="short"/> they also said there's nothing they can do <pause dur="short"/> so now we now we've gone through the Citizens Advice Bureau and we've applied for legal aid</u>
<u n="80" who="S0018">uh-huh</u>
<u n="81" who="S0002">and only one of the girls in the house qualifies for legal aid being free because if you earn over a if you have a certain amount in savings you can't get free legal aid</u>
<u n="82" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="83" who="S0002">so it's all up to her <pause dur="short"/> if she's willing to push <pause dur="short"/> otherwise we can be done for not paying rent</u>
<u n="84" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0002">it has to be done properly <pause dur="short"/> which is such a pain in the arse <pause dur="short"/> the whole thing</u>
<u n="86" who="S0018">and have you  have you  got any er is there not a legal adviser in the university housing association?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0002">no</u>
<u n="88" who="S0018">Cos can you is there not?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0002">no <pause dur="short"/> I've taken my contract</u>
<u n="90" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="91" who="S0002">and they've just kind of gone well we can't do anything <pause dur="short"/> they're pretty useless <pause dur="short"/> shouldn't really be saying this on a recording should I</u>
<u n="92" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Why don't? Oh</u>
<u n="93" who="S0002">um I <trunc>mea</trunc> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I don't <trunc>kno</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> cos it's a standard agreement <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I don't even understand why we're in such a difficult position to it's er so something will break and then someone will come round and it'll be fixed for like a few days and then it'll break again <pause dur="short"/> so it's not like they're not reacting <pause dur="short"/> every time we complain they do come round like pretty quickly <pause dur="short"/> but it's just the point that if they dont' replace it or if they don't give us a proper solution <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="94" who="S0018">well they're obviously fixing trying to fix something that can't be fixed <pause dur="short"/> needs replacing</u>
<u n="95" who="S0002">basically <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0018">and in your contract does it say that the that they are responsible for upkeeping the I don't know what they'd call it the</u>
<u n="97" who="S0002">there's a yeah the like</u>
<u n="98" who="S0018">fixtures and fittings</u>
<u n="99" who="S0002">yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0018">and</u>
<u n="101" who="S0002">I mean like it's one of those contracts which is like thirty statements long <pause dur="short"/> and one statement says the house will be kept in a reputable <trunc>whatev</trunc> I can't remember the exact wording <pause dur="short"/> but there is one clause that says that they but it doesn't define what it means by <trunc>inh</trunc> inhabitable</u>
<u n="102" who="S0018">well if there's no hot water</u>
<u n="103" who="S0002">hot water</u>
<u n="104" who="S0018">and no heating that's hardly habitable is it?</u>
<u n="105" who="S0002">they keep saying to us oh summer's coming soon <pause dur="short"/> and we're like and we'll still want a hot shower <pause dur="short"/> your point is really not valid at all <pause dur="short"/> like</u>
<u n="106" who="S0018">well why don't you just try and get a lawyer to just get advice to say look they've broken the contract in that they haven't kept the house habitable um I want to write them a letter saying <trunc>vie</trunc> er</u>
<u n="107" who="S0002">Don't I have to pay for that?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0018">in consideration <pause dur="short"/> well I dunno <pause dur="short"/> try and find a</u>
<u n="109" who="S0002">that's why we're trying to go through the legal aid thing</u>
<u n="110" who="S0018">or just ask er ask the question <pause dur="short"/> if I write this letter saying that they've broken this contract and this there has been no hot water and no heating since November?</u>
<u n="111" who="S0002">it's been intermittent since December</u>
<u n="112" who="S0018">then that's you know that's not they're breaking the contract <pause dur="short"/> that's not what you signed up for</u>
<u n="113" who="S0002">I think we talked to the landlord recently <pause dur="short"/> apparently they've been trying to get hold of him and he won't answer the calls <pause dur="short"/> and then finally the estate agent gave us cos one of the girls was yelling at him on the phone and she he gave us the landlord's number <pause dur="short"/> and he the landlord phoned back and he sweet-talked her <pause dur="short"/> I was just watching her on the phone just going</u>
<u n="114" who="S0018">oh</u>
<u n="115" who="S0002">she started off really angry and then she sort of calmed down <pause dur="short"/> and then by the end of it she was simpering on the phone <pause dur="short"/> and I was just like</u>
<u n="116" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh no</u>
<u n="117" who="S0002">come on woman <pause dur="short"/> like <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> But um it sounded like he said he wasn't aware of the problem <pause dur="short"/> yeah right <pause dur="short"/> I don't believe you <pause dur="short"/> um and that he was gonna get someone round <pause dur="short"/> some of his own people to check it <pause dur="short"/> and if it needs changing he's willing to change it <pause dur="short"/> but it's just been going on forever <pause dur="short"/> like and I think if we do threaten not to pay they probably will just fix it <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I won't be able to break the contract</u>
<u n="118" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="119" who="S0002">which is kind of the idea</u>
<u n="120" who="S0018">well that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> just don't threaten <pause dur="short"/> just say look for the past four months it's been uninhabitable <pause dur="short"/> we've been repeatedly telling you <pause dur="short"/> it has not been fixed <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I cannot continue I'm in  I'm in  full-time education <pause dur="short"/> I have a lot of work to do <pause dur="short"/> blah blah blah blah blah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> we've we've said</u>
<u n="122" who="S0018">this is</u>
<u n="123" who="S0002">all of this</u>
<u n="124" who="S0018">compromising my ability to concentrate <pause dur="short"/> it's um making it extremely inconvenient for me on a day-to-day basis because I have to go and have showers</u>
<u n="125" who="S0002">at home</u>
<u n="126" who="S0018">twenty miles <vocal desc="laugh"/> away</u>
<u n="127" who="S0002">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0018">um <pause dur="short"/> for this</u>
<u n="129" who="S0002">but</u>
<u n="130" who="S0018">reason I would like to dissolve the contract based on the fact that you haven't respected</u>
<u n="131" who="S0002">I er that's actually I think pretty much been said <pause dur="short"/> and the answer just is you can't <pause dur="short"/> so without some legal intervention somewhere</u>
<u n="132" who="S0018">can you not? SE What about the Citizens Advice Bureau?</u>
<u n="133" who="S0002">that's yeah that's why we're going <trunc>throu</trunc> we've been to them and they said we need to go through legal aid</u>
<u n="134" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="135" who="S0002">which takes time and I mean they're booking us an appointment and the girl has to go in and see them <pause dur="short"/> and we can't all go because we can't all be represented <pause dur="short"/> blah blah blah blah blah <pause dur="short"/> it's just like typical really <pause dur="short"/> but to be honest I'm I just wanna forget it <pause dur="short"/> as in I'll just keep paying the rent just for an easy life in a way</u>
<u n="136" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0002">and I can just go home whenever <trunc>anyw</trunc> I'm lucky I have that option <pause dur="short"/> the other girls don't <pause dur="short"/> their family's down in London so</u>

<u n="326" who="S0018">cool</u>
<u n="327" who="S0002">I'm sort of hoping that it might happen <pause dur="short"/> but it's very hard to sort out the visa</u>
<u n="328" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="329" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> because you need a visa to go to China <pause dur="short"/> and they need to know your concrete travel plans <pause dur="short"/> so I can't apply for it here</u>
<u n="330" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="331" who="S0002">because I want to buy the ticket in Japan <pause dur="short"/> so that means I'd have to apply for the visa in Japan <pause dur="short"/> dunno how long it takes</u>
<u n="332" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="333" who="S0002">so I'm not sure if it's even possible</u>

<u n="335" who="S0002">it is <pause dur="short"/> I wish I could just get up and go but</u>
<u n="336" who="S0018">er go to Taiwan instead <pause dur="short"/> I don't think you need a visa to <trunc>g</trunc> get into there</u>
<u n="337" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>y</trunc> can you go from Taiwan? I know you can go from Hong Kong into China quite easily</u>
<u n="338" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="339" who="S0002">I dunno about Taiwan</u>
<u n="340" who="S0018">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I've no idea <pause dur="short"/> and so did you were you trying to get um teaching work in China?</u>
<u n="341" who="S0002">before?</u>
<u n="342" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you know the the whole pre-sessional thing</u>
<u n="343" who="S0002">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> I wanted to <pause dur="short"/> but I I kept umming and erring which was my demise because</u>
<u n="344" who="S0018">aha</u>
<u n="345" who="S0002">it would be from May to June <pause dur="short"/> and I have to hand in my first full draft by the end of June <pause dur="short"/> so to do both at the same time was probably a bad idea <pause dur="short"/> but I am overlapping one <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>mon</trunc> six weeks of pre-sessional with the end of my dissertation</u>
<u n="346" who="S0018">how many weeks have you got to do your dissertation?</u>

<u n="348" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="349" who="S0002">so I'm hoping that I'll be pretty much done by the end of July <pause dur="short"/> then I can do corrections in August and work at the same time for the six weeks and that's the plan <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if it's gonna happen</u>
<u n="350" who="S0018">mm <pause dur="short"/> has um has your tutor been quite supportive and helpful in <trunc>di</trunc> er your proposals? Your <trunc>d</trunc> for your dissertation? Or? You know it sounds like you're just giving her ideas and she's</u>
<u n="351" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I just say I've thought about this and she tells me yes you can do it no you can't do it you can do that for a PhD love <pause dur="short"/> and I'm like I don't wanna do a PhD</u>

<u n="354" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="355" who="S0002">but here it's quite a small department <pause dur="short"/> but the problem is is they won't give you ideas <pause dur="short"/> and if you're really stuck then you're really stuck</u>
<u n="356" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="357" who="S0002">like if you don't know what to do <pause dur="short"/> cos I really can't think of er a plan B <pause dur="short"/> which I probably might need</u>

<u n="359" who="S0002">most people are not doing teaching related projects</u>
<u n="360" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="361" who="S0002">because there's actually only five applied linguistics people <pause dur="short"/> there's a huge number of critical discourse in communication like my friend that you met earlier <pause dur="short"/> um and there's quite a lot of TEFL people <pause dur="short"/> but they're doing very TEFLy things</u>
<u n="362" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="363" who="S0002">like how does this affect a classroom? Or I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I don't really wanna do anything too TEFLy <pause dur="short"/> cos I didn't I did half of my courses very linguistic and half TEFL <pause dur="short"/> so I tried to make a balance <pause dur="short"/> but it might have been my undoing in some <vocal desc="laugh"/> ways <pause dur="short"/> like</u>
<u n="364" who="S0018">what kind of TEFL stuff did you cover?</u>
<u n="365" who="S0002">I did teacher training</u>
<u n="366" who="S0018">oh yeah</u>
<u n="367" who="S0002">um <pause dur="short"/> english for academic purposes <pause dur="short"/> and that's it actually <pause dur="short"/> and everything else has been linguistics</u>
<u n="368" who="S0018">and did they actually provide modules lectures and stuff on those subjects?</u>
<u n="369" who="S0002">yes</u>
<u n="370" who="S0018">oh right</u>
<u n="371" who="S0002">but that's part of the TEFL course that I kind of</u>

<u n="375" who="S0002">but the other stuff I've done is corpus linguistics <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="376" who="S0018">aha <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="377" who="S0002">discourse yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> um discourse analysis <pause dur="short"/> and social <trunc>socio</trunc> sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics</u>
<u n="378" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="379" who="S0002">and yeah kind of</u>
<u n="380" who="S0018">have you had to cover like structural linguistics and stuff like that?</u>
<u n="381" who="S0002">we had a choice <pause dur="short"/> I didn't cos</u>
<u n="382" who="S0018">oh <pause dur="short"/> good choice <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="383" who="S0002">we all did do a bit of functional grammar <pause dur="short"/> which was not fun</u>
<u n="384" who="S0018">urgh</u>
<u n="385" who="S0002">urgh <pause dur="short"/> I ended up writing my assignment on we had a choice between functional grammar analysis and <trunc>f</trunc> um something to do with lexis <pause dur="short"/> and I went down the lexis road <pause dur="short"/> which was probably the best decision I've ever made</u>
<u n="386" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="387" who="S0002">because I would've failed the grammar <pause dur="short"/> a lot of people failed apparently</u>
<u n="388" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="389" who="S0002">I think like cos we spent three lessons three ninety minute lessons analyzing one sentence</u>
<u n="390" who="S0018">oh my Lord <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="391" who="S0002">so most of us were not really prepared to go in and do a full analysis by ourself <pause dur="short"/> and I think about more than half of the people that submitted that paper failed it <pause dur="short"/> so yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was a good idea not to do it</u>
<u n="392" who="S0018">how long are papers?</u>
<u n="393" who="S0002">four thousand words</u>

<u n="397" who="S0002">it's not <pause dur="short"/> its actually probably not enough <pause dur="short"/> cos I have a</u>

<u n="399" who="S0002">problem with TE wittering</u>
<u n="400" who="S0018">especially for a research project</u>
<u n="401" who="S0002">yeah</u>
<u n="402" who="S0018">as well <pause dur="short"/> were the papers just like essays? Or were they research?</u>
<u n="403" who="S0002">we have one research paper this term <pause dur="short"/> and everything else is just essays</u>
<u n="404" who="S0018">so how many have there been in total? Apart from the dissertation</u>
<u n="405" who="S0002">not that many you know <pause dur="short"/> I don't know why I spend all my time complaining <pause dur="short"/> um</u>

<u n="407" who="S0002">I've done three already <pause dur="short"/> I have three more now <pause dur="short"/> and then I have my dissertation <pause dur="short"/> so six papers plus a dissertation</u>

<u n="419" who="S0002">so I'm just like it's not interesting <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I don't wanna write about it <pause dur="short"/> that's a problem</u>
<u n="420" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="421" who="S0002">like you have to be interested otherwise <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="422" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0002">well you don't have to be interested <pause dur="short"/> but it sure does help <pause dur="short"/> like</u>
<u n="424" who="S0018">and it what what do you think the masters level is like? Cos I was you know the course I was doing was er um at a masters level <pause dur="short"/> but I thought that it was graded <pause dur="short"/> I mean huh I read some of the papers that the research projects that um some of my fellow school mates <vocal desc="laugh"/> classmates whatever you call it</u>
<u n="425" who="S0002">mhm</u>
<u n="426" who="S0018">er had written <pause dur="short"/> cos they asked me to proofread them</u>
<u n="427" who="S0002">yeah</u>
<u n="428" who="S0018">um <pause dur="short"/> not only was the language awful but the actual content was awful as well</u>
<u n="429" who="S0002">but did they do well?</u>
<u n="430" who="S0018">well they passed</u>
<u n="431" who="S0002">they passed?</u>
<u n="432" who="S0018">they passed a masters level assignment</u>
<u n="433" who="S0002">I think passing well I don't know to be honest because I proofread <trunc>s</trunc> one of my friend's papers and she failed two papers <pause dur="short"/> and when I started reading it I thought why has she failed? It's not that bad <pause dur="short"/> but when I got into it structurally</u>
<u n="434" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="435" who="S0002">and content wise she didn't have a clear understanding of what she was doing</u>
<u n="436" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="437" who="S0002">so I did understand why</u>
<u n="438" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="439" who="S0002">but I think I mean you know I don't know many people that are getting firsts to be honest <pause dur="short"/> like it seems pretty hard to do well</u>
<u n="440" who="S0018">well I got</u>
<u n="441" who="S0002">it seems fairly</u>
<u n="442" who="S0018">I got two distinctions</u>
<u n="443" who="S0002">oo <pause dur="short"/> get you</u>
<u n="444" who="S0018">and I was just absolutely floored cos it's</u>
<u n="445" who="S0002">why? You've so much experience you're</u>
<u n="446" who="S0018">because it just</u>
<u n="447" who="S0002">bringing to the table <pause dur="short"/> like</u>
<u n="448" who="S0018">yeah but it just felt like it was the <trunc>re</trunc> the research was completely Mickey Mouse</u>
<u n="449" who="S0002">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="450" who="S0018">whereas I was thinking oo masters level research it's going to be really heavy and</u>
<u n="451" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="452" who="S0018">it's gonna be statistical analysis <pause dur="short"/> and it's gonna be</u>
<u n="453" who="S0002">no I don't think it is that bad</u>
<u n="454" who="S0018">and lots of different variables <pause dur="short"/> and it wasn't <pause dur="short"/> it was just basically</u>

<u n="456" who="S0018">Mickey Mouse</u>
<u n="457" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="458" who="S0002">how many papers have you already submitted?</u>
<u n="459" who="S0018">three <pause dur="short"/> and I'd have to do three more</u>
<u n="460" who="S0002">okay <pause dur="short"/> and then dissertation?</u>
<u n="461" who="S0018">no there is no dissertation</u>
<u n="462" who="S0002">there's no dissertation?</u>
<u n="463" who="S0018">Cos it's it's so practical based</u>
<u n="464" who="S0002">and how long are the papers?</u>
<u n="465" who="S0018">three thousand words</u>
<u n="466" who="S0002">okay</u>
<u n="467" who="S0018">which is a nightmare because it's so difficult <pause dur="short"/> because you have so many things that you have to do <pause dur="short"/> the requirements of the</u>
<u n="468" who="S0002">so keeping it short and concise</u>
<u n="469" who="S0018">yeah</u>

<u n="471" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="472" who="S0002">yep <pause dur="short"/> that's hard</u>
<u n="473" who="S0018">it was difficult <pause dur="short"/> like so you had to write an introduction <pause dur="short"/> review the government documentation <pause dur="short"/> then review the literature <pause dur="short"/> then describe your rationale behind choosing the research methods that you did</u>
<u n="474" who="S0002">mm</u>
<u n="475" who="S0018">and then describe the research methods</u>
<u n="476" who="S0002">that's a lot</u>
<u n="477" who="S0018">and then TE analyse the research methods and TE analyse how if they worked <pause dur="short"/> did I just say that? Can't remember</u>
<u n="478" who="S0002">no</u>
<u n="479" who="S0018">see I'm getting confused just telling you about it</u>
<u n="480" who="S0002">well the I mean if it if you have to do that much it's literally what? A paragraph for each thing?</u>
<u n="481" who="S0018">more or less</u>
<u n="482" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean er</u>
<u n="483" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean obviously you have to do the critical analysis with it <pause dur="short"/> I the yeah the <trunc>crit</trunc> the review of the literature</u>
<u n="484" who="S0002">yeah</u>
<u n="485" who="S0018">was more or less two sides</u>
<u n="486" who="S0002">sides</u>
<u n="487" who="S0018">and then the evaluation and of your findings and criticizing your research methods was about two sides <pause dur="short"/> but I <trunc>d</trunc> I dunno I just felt that it was really</u>
<u n="488" who="S0002">Mickey Mouse?</u>
<u n="489" who="S0018">Mickey Mouse <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Squeak</u>
<u n="490" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="491" who="S0018">but I guess you don't find that <pause dur="short"/> maybe cos on my course it was more practical</u>
<u n="492" who="S0002">I'm finding well I mean I don't I I didn't know at the beginning what a good level was <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean? Like what is what was a distinction? You have no idea until you've actually submitted something and got it back <pause dur="short"/> and for my first paper I got a distinction</u>
<u n="493" who="S0018">all As</u>
<u n="494" who="S0002">and then after that I didn't do so well <pause dur="short"/> I got two merits <pause dur="short"/> but low merits <pause dur="short"/> and I just thought I couldn't see the difference <vocal desc="laugh"/> between what I had done in the first and the other two <pause dur="short"/> and I was just like okay <pause dur="short"/> you set me up on a high but I still don't understand how to get up there now</u>
<u n="495" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="496" who="S0002">like it's er the the things last term cos it was all new <pause dur="short"/> I mean linguistics I don't really have a background in it <pause dur="short"/> I didn't really know <pause dur="short"/> it was all brand new <pause dur="short"/> they that all felt quite hard <pause dur="short"/> but this term the two TEFL papers <pause dur="short"/> they don't seem hard <pause dur="short"/> it's not challenging <pause dur="short"/> it's just trying to put it all together in a good way</u>
<u n="497" who="S0018"><unclear/></u>
<u n="498" who="S0002">yeah</u>
<u n="499" who="S0018">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="500" who="S0002">in fact I might show you one of my papers in a bit <pause dur="short"/> and go</u>
<u n="501" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no problem</u>
<u n="502" who="S0002">what do you think of this rubbish</u>

<u n="504" who="S0002">oh</u>
<u n="505" who="S0018">it sounds so difficult having to choose your dissertation topic with no hardly any support though</u>
<u n="506" who="S0002">but I guess that's the way it is</u>
<u n="507" who="S0018">so what's your driving instructor like?</u>
<u n="508" who="S0002">I thought no more complaining</u>

<u n="510" who="S0002">he's alright <pause dur="short"/> he shouts a lot</u>

<u n="513" who="S0018">really chilled <pause dur="short"/> he's such a nice guy <pause dur="short"/> he's really er er er his instructions are really clear <pause dur="short"/> and they come at exactly the right moment <pause dur="short"/> and he chats around them as well to keep me really calm <pause dur="short"/> and it's it's as if like everything's really natural <pause dur="short"/> I felt</u>

<u n="517" who="S0018">oh no</u>
<u n="518" who="S0002">but I mean I like him <pause dur="short"/> and he I feel like he pushes me <pause dur="short"/> but he's quite critical if I mess up <pause dur="short"/> I mean how many lessons have you had?</u>

<u n="552" who="S0002">the thing is that I'm I've been driving around the test centre roads near my parents' house <pause dur="short"/> and it's got a higher pass rate than the ones near here <pause dur="short"/> because it's quiet it's a quiet very very quiet area</u>
<u n="553" who="S0018">I don't understand <pause dur="short"/> higher what?</u>
<u n="554" who="S0002">um so um different test centres have different pass rates <pause dur="short"/> and I've been practising around the roads around the test centre that I would go do my test at</u>
<u n="555" who="S0018">ah</u>
<u n="556" who="S0002">so I wanna stay in that area <pause dur="short"/> because I know it <pause dur="short"/> otherwise I'll have to learn a whole new area for the test</u>

<u n="558" who="S0002">so I've had like sixteen lessons <pause dur="short"/> so I'm</u>

<u n="568" who="S0002">oh I'm only there now <pause dur="short"/> and it's seventeen lessons later <pause dur="short"/> and now I feel it's quite natural to do everything <pause dur="short"/> I'm not thinking about it <pause dur="short"/> I'm not looking at the gear stick <pause dur="short"/> I'm not looking at my speed <pause dur="short"/> it's all <trunc>co</trunc> sort of just</u>
<u n="569" who="S0018">oh okay</u>

<u n="594" who="S0002">no <pause dur="short"/> and I'm one of these people that actually has no common sense sometimes <pause dur="short"/> and don't understand the <trunc>ba</trunc> like my friends er most of my friends drive and passed their test when they were like eighteen <pause dur="short"/> and they're all like testing me a while ago <pause dur="short"/> and they were like how do you not know this? It's common sense <pause dur="short"/> and I was like I just don't know <pause dur="short"/> I never paid any attentions when I was in a car with anyone <pause dur="short"/> like I don't really care about <trunc>driv</trunc> I didn't really care about driving <pause dur="short"/> never really wanted to pass <pause dur="short"/> so I wasn't really interested <pause dur="short"/> but it wasn't I think I was lucky and my test was not a hard one</u>
<u n="595" who="S0018">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> what kind of</u>
<u n="596" who="S0002">it depends on what you get</u>
<u n="597" who="S0018">what kind of questions came up?</u>
<u n="598" who="S0002">the usual <pause dur="short"/> like what's this sign mean? What's this speed limit? The the <trunc>har</trunc> the worst part is the hazard perception part <pause dur="short"/> which is you watch the video and then you have to click when you see a hazard <pause dur="short"/> and it only marks you on two <pause dur="short"/> and if you have to click within a second to get the full points <pause dur="short"/> so if you click a little bit too late you lose all those points <pause dur="short"/> and that's quite difficult <pause dur="short"/> when I did all the practices for that I failed it every single time <pause dur="short"/> but somehow in the actual test I passed it</u>
<u n="599" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh right <pause dur="short"/> and what kind of hazards come up?</u>
<u n="600" who="S0002">just for example if so you're watching a video and your car's travelling down a road and you're looking out for people stepping onto the road or something that might <pause dur="short"/> the thing is there are lots of things that can develop into a hazard</u>
<u n="601" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="602" who="S0002">like someone who's walking along the pavement might suddenly step onto the road <pause dur="short"/> but you don't get  you don't get  marked on seeing a potential hazard <pause dur="short"/> you get marked on seeing a hazard when it occurs</u>
<u n="603" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="604" who="S0002">so I'm just like click click</u>
<u n="605" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="606" who="S0002">click click</u>
<u n="607" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="608" who="S0002">click click click click like <vocal desc="laugh"/> it's just yeah <pause dur="short"/> um and the best hint that somebody gave me for the hazard  for the hazard  perception is you see a hazard <pause dur="short"/> click <pause dur="short"/> wait two seconds <pause dur="short"/> click again <pause dur="short"/> because if you didn't if you clicked it too quickly you'd lose the points</u>
<u n="609" who="S0018">oh okay</u>
<u n="610" who="S0002">so make sure you do it twice at least when you see the hazard <pause dur="short"/> and then you've got a better chance of getting some points for it <pause dur="short"/> rather than just</u>
<u n="611" who="S0018">oh no</u>
<u n="612" who="S0002">doing it once <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="613" who="S0018">didn't the theory test used to be just a few questions asked by the <trunc>ins</trunc> by the tester? When you were doing your</u>
<u n="614" who="S0002">you still have some questions asked by the <trunc>exa</trunc> by the driving instructor on your <trunc>dri</trunc></u>
<u n="615" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="616" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it's more about the car</u>
<u n="617" who="S0018">okay</u>
<u n="618" who="S0002">like you have to lift up the bonnet and say what's what <pause dur="short"/> and stuff like yeah</u>
<u n="619" who="S0018">no</u>
<u n="620" who="S0002">yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> just little  just little  Just like three or four questions</u>
<u n="621" who="S0018">oh my life</u>
<u n="622" who="S0002">nothing major <pause dur="short"/> I know <pause dur="short"/> it feels like a very high hill to climb to pass</u>
<u n="623" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="624" who="S0002">I mean cos they say like on average you take as many lessons as your age <pause dur="short"/> that's a lot of er lessons and a lot of money</u>
<u n="625" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh crikey</u>
<u n="626" who="S0002">and I'm just like uh</u>

<u n="629" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="630" who="S0002">I would say <pause dur="short"/> I don't think most people could pass in <trunc>twent</trunc> er not unless they're driving someone else's car all the time <pause dur="short"/> but you don't even do manoeuvres until like</u>
<u n="631" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> I'm not having any practice outside of the lessons</u>
<u n="632" who="S0002">I neither am I <pause dur="short"/> so it's just the lessons <pause dur="short"/> and that's quite a big ask</u>

<u n="652" who="S0002">me too <pause dur="short"/> I don't want a car at all</u>
<u n="653" who="S0018">but I just thought it would it's a good idea to</u>
<u n="654" who="S0002">it's good to have it <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="655" who="S0018">take advantage of this time</u>
<u n="656" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's the same</u>

<u n="660" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> this is what I thought <pause dur="short"/> it was just like it's just something it's <pause dur="short"/> one of my friends broke her leg in Japan and I was just thinking neither me or my boyfriend can drive <pause dur="short"/> if one of us could drive we could help her out</u>
<u n="661" who="S0018">mm</u>

<u n="663" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="664" who="S0002">and it would just be useful to to be able to hire a car sometimes to sort something out</u>
<u n="665" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="666" who="S0002">and so <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> so yeah kind of just wanna get it out of the way <pause dur="short"/> and it was supposed to be a competition between me and my boyfriend who would do it first <pause dur="short"/> but he hasn't even started his lessons</u>

<u n="672" who="S0002">they practise in a little grid area in the back of a test centre</u>
<u n="673" who="S0018">actually do you know what? I think I'd prefer to do that for the first</u>
<u n="674" who="S0002">for the first one or two</u>
<u n="675" who="S0018">first few lessons <pause dur="short"/> just to get confident to know what you're dealing with mechanically in the car</u>
<u n="676" who="S0002">yeah</u>
<u n="677" who="S0018">not I mean tut not bonnet and explain what's going on but what you have to do in order to change gear <pause dur="short"/> what you have to do in order to stop at a junction and <pause dur="short"/> it would be a lot easier to do that without a lot easier to get automatic without with that without worrying about</u>

<u n="894" who="S0002">and I had more flexibility <pause dur="short"/> could do what I wanted <pause dur="short"/> take a holiday when I wanted <pause dur="short"/> it just depends what you want I suppose</u>

<u n="907" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="908" who="S0002">I dunno</u>
<u n="909" who="S0018">it would be great to be able to earn full earn part-time wages and be able to live off them <pause dur="short"/> but I just think the price of the</u>
<u n="910" who="S0002">I think in Spain that's very hard</u>
<u n="911" who="S0018">oh it's impossible <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but the price of life</u>
<u n="912" who="S0002">in Japan</u>
<u n="913" who="S0018">is just horrendous <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="914" who="S0002">I used to make for one lesson er so I worked for a little I worked for British Council and I worked for a little college</u>
<u n="915" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="916" who="S0002">and they would term employ you per term <pause dur="short"/> but if you did one term you were fairly guaranteed to get the next term <pause dur="short"/> and in fact they'll keep you for as long as you want <pause dur="short"/> but the their whole thing was that they wouldn't employ anyone with enough classes for them to rely on that</u>

<u n="918" who="S0002">on them</u>
<u n="919" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="920" who="S0002">so they had a maximum of eight classes <pause dur="short"/> but if you did eight classes during the day so decent working hours that was two hundred  two hundred  thousand yen <pause dur="short"/> which is like</u>

<u n="927" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="928" who="S0002">sometimes <pause dur="short"/> so even that was enough to sort of keep me ticking over <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>m</trunc> the average rent in Tokyo is about eighty to ninety thousand</u>
<u n="929" who="S0018">right</u>
<u n="930" who="S0002">but a hundred thousand a month will quite happily clothe feed party whatever you wanna do</u>

<u n="932" who="S0002">it's quite a decent amount of money <pause dur="short"/> but like you said <pause dur="short"/> if anything happens</u>

<u n="934" who="S0002">you need to go home or something breaks down then yeah it's a problem</u>

<u n="1027" who="S0018">crazy <pause dur="short"/> but for example my friends are looking to buy <pause dur="short"/> they're living in <anon type="place"/> renting at the moment <pause dur="short"/> but <anon type="place"/>'s too expensive for them to buy in <pause dur="short"/> and they're looking at <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> which is right you know five minute drive down the road <pause dur="short"/> and the comparison price difference is</u>
<u n="1028" who="S0002">is so</u>
<u n="1029" who="S0018">enormous</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0002">different</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0018">I mean they're looking at um two bedroomed house <pause dur="short"/> er semi-detached or terraced or <pause dur="short"/> and in <anon type="place"/> you're looking at um two hundred and forty-two hundred and fifty thousand <pause dur="short"/> and in <anon type="place"/> you're looking at one hundred and sixty</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0002">oh okay</u>
<u n="1033" who="S0018">one hundred and seventy</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0002">there's a big difference then</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0018">really big difference <pause dur="short"/> so I imagine in Harborne it's the same</u>
<u n="1036" who="S0002">but I mean er we were looking at buying um before we rented we recently moved to a new flat in Tokyo <pause dur="short"/> and before we rented that place we were looking at houses <pause dur="short"/> we were looking at buying <pause dur="short"/> and you can buy a brand new house in Tokyo <pause dur="short"/> have it developed to how you want it <pause dur="short"/> the thing that's expensive is land <pause dur="short"/> but probably all in for a two three bedroom three three level house probably about three hundred thousand pounds <pause dur="short"/> but we're talking in the middle of a metropolitan city</u>
<u n="1037" who="S0018">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0002">and that's not bad</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0018">especially when salaries sound to be better</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0002">yeah they are a bit better <pause dur="short"/> so we were like well it would make a lot of sense but we don't know where we're gonna end up</u>
<u n="1041" who="S0018">so where why do you say that you don't know if you wanna live in Japan? Cos I <trunc>th</trunc> I thought you seemed quite enamoured by it all</u>
<u n="1042" who="S0002">no I mean I like it <pause dur="short"/> but I don't the idea of spending a long time there doesn't appeal</u>
<u n="1043" who="S0018">is that in light of what happened last year with the earthquake? And the nuclear?</u>
<u n="1044" who="S0002">it's a little bit about that <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> a little bit about the earthquake <pause dur="short"/> a little bit just about bringing up a family there</u>
<u n="1045" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1046" who="S0002">um <pause dur="short"/> and being away from my family</u>
<u n="1047" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1048" who="S0002">I want like I the thing that fills me with terror which is me getting way ahead of myself of course but I don't wanna have a child and be away from my mum</u>
<u n="1049" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1050" who="S0002">and not only be away but be an ocean</u>
<u n="1051" who="S0018"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1052" who="S0002">a thirteen-hour plane ride away</u>
<u n="1053" who="S0018">exactly <pause dur="short"/> it is so far isn't it</u>
<u n="1054" who="S0002">it's really far <pause dur="short"/> and I don't think that his family are gonna really be that involved in our lives</u>
<u n="1055" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1056" who="S0002">so I just  I just  want a support network as I get older</u>
<u n="1057" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1058" who="S0002">and as they get older <pause dur="short"/> I'm worried about my parents too</u>
<u n="1059" who="S0018">yep <pause dur="short"/> that was one of the deciding factors in me er in my coming home as well</u>
<u n="1060" who="S0002">yeah</u>
<u n="1061" who="S0018">especially with all the injuries I had <pause dur="short"/> it was just so much easier having being able to rely on people in case</u>
<u n="1062" who="S0002">mm</u>
<u n="1063" who="S0018">all of a sudden you've you can't</u>
<u n="1064" who="S0002">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you can't</u>
<u n="1065" who="S0018">rely on your body or something</u>
<u n="1066" who="S0002">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> and the other thing is there is still quite a big language barrier <pause dur="short"/> I mean I would have <trunc>t</trunc> I feel like if I made a commitment to going back I would have to go back to language school</u>
<u n="1067" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1068" who="S0002">just to improve my spoken <pause dur="short"/> but I'm always gonna be have the huge barrier of reading and writing</u>
<u n="1069" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1070" who="S0002">because that is not something you can make up <pause dur="short"/> that's like prr ten years I would say to become</u>
<u n="1071" who="S0018">yep</u>
<u n="1072" who="S0002">get to a point where you can sort of get by</u>
<u n="1073" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1074" who="S0002">so that's a huge thing is feeling like I live on a periphery of a society <pause dur="short"/> and I've that's okay when you're just <trunc>visi</trunc> not visiting but</u>
<u n="1075" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1076" who="S0002">it's temporary <pause dur="short"/> but if that was to somehow become permanent I don't know how well I would do with that <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="1077" who="S0018">it does leave you feeling slightly marginalized doesn't it</u>
<u n="1078" who="S0002">and yeah er I'm not the brightest when it comes to languages <pause dur="short"/> they're pretty hard <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Like</u>

<u n="1084" who="S0002">that's like three four <trunc>hou</trunc> four hours tuition a day <pause dur="short"/> and I was doing that and working eight hours a day at the same time <pause dur="short"/> so I probably didn't get as much of it as out of it as I should've</u>
<u n="1085" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1086" who="S0002">but it was just so expensive <pause dur="short"/> I don't know how people afford it <pause dur="short"/> and everyone else there was a full-time student <pause dur="short"/> there was me like beavering away at work and doing homework and doing classes <pause dur="short"/> and just like huh can't do this <pause dur="short"/> it's exhausting <pause dur="short"/> like</u>

<u n="1097" who="S0002">but actually studying</u>
<u n="1098" who="S0018">but actually <trunc>stu</trunc> oh and exams and urgh</u>
