<u n="4" who="S0428">yeah you can just pop in it's not too far is it?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0432" trans="overlap">but I don't know cos everybody's gonna look really dressed up cos it's a black and white party <pause dur="short"/> and she's gonna go in colour <pause dur="short"/> so I <trunc>h</trunc> I have a feeling that everybody's gonna be in like <pause dur="short"/> really smart <pause dur="short"/> like all the lads'll be in <pause dur="short"/> like smart black suit trousers won't they and a white shirt? <pause dur="short"/> I just don't know if I can be bothered to get dressed up that much just for an hour</u>
<u n="6" who="S0428">yeah probably not <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="7" who="S0432">I feel really bad but I'll see I might just see how I get on with packing for holiday <pause dur="short"/> cos I don't <pause dur="short"/> even know exactly what time I'll finish here</u>
<u n="8" who="S0428">yeah like</u>
<u n="9" who="S0432">and then <pause dur="short"/> I've gotta get home <pause dur="short"/> pack <pause dur="short"/> we've got to make sure the house is tidy cos we're having a <pause dur="short"/> inspection <pause dur="short"/> when we're away</u>
<u n="10" who="S0428">really?</u>
<u n="11" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> bit weird <pause dur="short"/> I'm a bit worried though <pause dur="short"/> cos I don't <pause dur="short"/> cos I thought we'd have to be there <pause dur="short"/> at the <pause dur="short"/> bit worried like letting them into my house <pause dur="short"/> it's not my house but <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0428">it's not very <trunc>ni</trunc> I dunno it feels a bit</u>
<u n="13" who="S0432" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> I'm a bit <pause dur="short"/> especially like</u>
<u n="14" who="S0428" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0432">cos we're away as well we're not just at work or something we're away <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="16" who="S0428">are you definitely gonna stay there now?</u>
<u n="17" who="S0432">erm I <trunc>d</trunc> we are for now <pause dur="short"/> we might do another year there <pause dur="short"/> but we don't wanna rent <unclear>premise</unclear> it's a bit it's kind of like dead money isn't it? but we don't know where we want to live yet so <pause dur="short"/> we might as well rent <pause dur="short"/> until we know what <unclear>where we wanna go after</unclear></u>
<u n="18" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> do you have like different ideas of where you wanna buy or?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0432">erm <pause dur="short"/> kind of <vocal desc="laugh"/> I think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> wants to go abroad <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0428" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="21" who="S0432">I was like <pause dur="short"/> cos <pause dur="short"/> the I don't I think when it <pause dur="short"/> we actually come to like seriously talk about it he won't want to <pause dur="short"/> cos we've both done it we've both lived abroad <pause dur="short"/> for a while <pause dur="short"/> I know I only did like a year abroad but</u>
<u n="22" who="S0428">yeah <pause dur="short"/> no it's still</u>
<u n="23" who="S0432">yeah and he's lived in New Zealand</u>
<u n="24" who="S0428">where does he? has he got anywhere like in mind or?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0432">what abroad or?</u>
<u n="26" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0432">originally before I got the job here <pause dur="short"/> we <trunc>wan</trunc> we were looking into Gibraltar</u>
<u n="28" who="S0428">oh I remember you saying yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah cos I wanted somewhere where I could speak Spanish and he wanted somewhere where he could speak English <pause dur="short"/> so we were just like just go to Spain cos <pause dur="short"/> but then he looked into Gibraltar and cos he wanted to learn Spanish as well and he just thought that's kind of but I think it's quite expensive</u>
<u n="30" who="S0428">mm</u>
<u n="31" who="S0432">to live there</u>
<u n="32" who="S0428" trans="overlap">I think it's might be a bit claustrophobic as well</u>
<u n="33" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah cos it's <trunc>on</trunc> apparently it's like the population's like south of <anon type="place"/> or something</u>
<u n="34" who="S0428"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="35" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I was like I'm not sure I could manage that</u>
<u n="36" who="S0428">and I think like you're kinda cut off cos it's you have to like go through quite <trunc>s</trunc>strict control like backwards and forwards and stuff so</u>
<u n="37" who="S0432" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="misc"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> to get out anywhere unless you just go by boat to</u>
<u n="38" who="S0428">yeah</u>
<u n="39" who="S0432">Spain the south of Spain</u>
<u n="40" who="S0428" trans="overlap">and then you'd be like I just wanna live in Spain <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0432">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos some people <pause dur="short"/> kind of <pause dur="short"/> lived in Spain and then worked in Gibraltar or something didn't they?</u>
<u n="42" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="43" who="S0432">there was like a programme on like Britain in the sun or something?</u>
<u n="44" who="S0428">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0432">and they were saying they live in <pause dur="short"/> south of Spain cos it's cheaper but work in Gibraltar but just getting across was just manic</u>
<u n="46" who="S0428">I think you can be stuck for hours</u>
<u n="47" who="S0432">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't wanna <pause dur="short"/> wouldn't wanna go there <pause dur="short"/> so yeah we scrapped that idea</u>
<u n="48" who="S0428"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if we will</u>
<u n="50" who="S0428">but would you stay round this area?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0432">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> think so</u>
<u n="52" who="S0428">can his job like could he work abroad with his job? yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0432">I think so <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0428">that's really cool</u>
<u n="55" who="S0432">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and <trunc>I</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> I mean not with this job but <trunc>c</trunc> probably could go into like <pause dur="short"/> teaching or something <pause dur="short"/> dunno</u>
<u n="56" who="S0428">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="57" who="S0432">I dunno <trunc>h</trunc> what <pause dur="short"/> it depends where we go and like <pause dur="short"/> I'd have to do a qualification first <pause dur="short"/> yeah cos if we <pause dur="short"/> my sister went to Australia in the beginning of this year <pause dur="short"/> and she was like you have to go and live out there because they <pause dur="short"/> there's so many Chinese people and they want <trunc>Chine</trunc> there's adverts for Chinese teachers everywhere <pause dur="short"/> so you have to go and I was like <vocal desc="sigh"/> I don't know if I'd wanna</u>
<u n="58" who="S0428">it's so far like</u>
<u n="59" who="S0432">and it's and it's expensive as well like I know it's</u>
<u n="60" who="S0428" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0432">it's all relative so you'd probably get paid <pause dur="short"/> a better wage but <pause dur="short"/> it is it is really far</u>
<u n="62" who="S0428">I think the boom's like come and gone there <pause dur="short"/> my cos my <trunc>fa</trunc> when my family moved out <pause dur="short"/> erm there <pause dur="short"/> it was really cheap like they bought houses for nothing <pause dur="short"/> and now they're like they've gone massively up but <pause dur="short"/> the food is so expensive like</u>
<u n="63" who="S0432" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="64" who="S0428">like they can't afford anything now</u>
<u n="65" who="S0432" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0428">although they do have like swimming pools in their garden <vocal desc="laugh"/> and stuff like I don't feel that sorry for you <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="67" who="S0432"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>and you don't know why</unclear> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0428"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="69" who="S0432">but it's totally different in New Zealand isn't it? because they all live in like <pause dur="short"/> tin houses don't they?</u>
<u n="70" who="S0428">do they?</u>
<u n="71" who="S0432">like some of them are like still in like corrugated like tin <pause dur="short"/> I remember when we I skyped my <trunc>fam</trunc> my cousins <pause dur="short"/> who live out there <pause dur="short"/> they're not living in one now but were a <pause dur="short"/> a few years ago they were</u>

<u n="74" who="S0428"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="75" who="S0432">just looks like a portacabin or something <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> but no yeah now they live in <pause dur="short"/> in a nice area <pause dur="short"/> but yeah I was just like what? it's really</u>
<u n="76" who="S0428">yeah that's crazy</u>
<u n="77" who="S0432">doesn't just didn't seem very developed <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> for this</u>
