<u n="231" who="S0084">and then the next one can be mine <pause dur="short"/> and then the third one will be er for sale <pause dur="short"/> so cos er cos really you can undercut the prices here <pause dur="short"/> you could sell it for ten thousand or fifteen thousand and still make an eight thousand pound profit</u>
<u n="232" who="S0037">okay <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> some interesting ideas there <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="233" who="S0084">I mean er the barges that I did see when I researched</u>
<u n="234" who="S0037">mm</u>
<u n="235" who="S0084">this weren't two grand</u>
<u n="236" who="S0037">right</u>
<u n="237" who="S0084">they were twenty-seven euro twenty-seven thousand euro</u>
<u n="238" who="S0037">right <pause dur="short"/> so that's</u>
<u n="239" who="S0084">so what I need to find out er from my uncle is whether this is realistic <pause dur="short"/> because he said his friends have done it <pause dur="short"/> so for me</u>
<u n="240" who="S0037">can you really sail a barge across the English Channel?</u>
<u n="241" who="S0084">I think you have to find out stuff like shipping lanes et cetera <pause dur="short"/> cos you don't wanna end up er in the same lane as a <trunc>f</trunc> bloody</u>
<u n="242" who="S0037">P and O</u>
<u n="243" who="S0084">ferry</u>
<u n="244" who="S0037">no</u>

<u n="246" who="S0037">but I mean like is it not too wavy? Hm?</u>
<u n="247" who="S0084">no I don't think so</u>
<u n="248" who="S0037">mm</u>
<u n="249" who="S0084">is it wavy? It's only the Channel</u>
<u n="250" who="S0037">it's quite wavy</u>
<u n="251" who="S0084">well if you think like as we know my geography's really good</u>
<u n="252" who="S0037"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="253" who="S0084">so if you <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="254" who="S0037">oh <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Here we go</u>
<u n="255" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="256" who="S0084">if you think that this is the bottom of the UK</u>
<u n="257" who="S0037">right</u>
<u n="258" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="259" who="S0084">this is Dover</u>
<u n="260" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="261" who="S0037">er <pause dur="short"/> is it?</u>
<u n="262" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="263" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> because that's Kent</u>
<u n="264" who="S0037">oh okay then <pause dur="short"/> right</u>
<u n="265" who="S0084">so that's Dover</u>
<u n="266" who="S0037">uh-huh</u>
<u n="267" who="S0084">here's Europe</u>
<u n="268" who="S0037">uh-huh</u>
<u n="269" who="S0084">and then Holland is like here isn't it?</u>
<u n="270" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="271" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="272" who="S0037">not too bad</u>
<u n="273" who="S0084">success <pause dur="short"/> so it's actually only a case of that to that</u>
<u n="274" who="S0037">yeah but</u>
<u n="275" who="S0084">so it's in the straight isn't it <pause dur="short"/> as opposed to like being open sea</u>
<u n="276" who="S0037">I think it is all</u>
<u n="277" who="S0084">is my theory</u>
<u n="278" who="S0037">kind of open sea</u>
<u n="279" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="280" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it does need more research</u>
<u n="281" who="S0037">it's not just like er does not it's not just like you know a small lake you know <pause dur="short"/> the Channel's quite <pause dur="short"/> so would you sail it like round the? I don't even know if you can sail it on the coast <pause dur="short"/> I don't even know if you're supposed to</u>
<u n="282" who="S0084">you have to sail it into the rivers</u>
<u n="283" who="S0037">right</u>
<u n="284" who="S0084">so you'd have to like maybe you'd come in on the Norfolk Broads <pause dur="short"/> like go up the <trunc>Nor</trunc></u>
<u n="285" who="S0037">okay</u>
<u n="286" who="S0084">in so up the Channel into the North Sea <pause dur="short"/> and then left</u>
<u n="287" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="288" who="S0037">right <pause dur="short"/> well good luck with that</u>

<u n="293" who="S0084">isn't there <vocal desc="laugh"/> an Only Fools and Horses episode where they try to sail to Holland?</u>

<u n="295" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="296" who="S0037">I think you've just <trunc>re</trunc></u>

<u n="298" who="S0037">written a new one</u>
<u n="299" who="S0084">uh</u>
<u n="300" who="S0037">well it's an interesting idea <pause dur="short"/> I like the premise <pause dur="short"/> I'm not sure about the practicalities</u>
<u n="301" who="S0084">tut <pause dur="short"/> um what I need to ask myself is er if it's a good use of my er finances</u>
<u n="302" who="S0037">uh-huh</u>
<u n="303" who="S0084">because also there's the plan to run away</u>
<u n="304" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="305" who="S0084">which is always a viable plan</u>
<u n="306" who="S0037">so hang on <pause dur="short"/> would you live on this barge?</u>
<u n="307" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="308" who="S0037">right</u>
<u n="309" who="S0084">because what I'd quite like to do is do that and then if I do move away I've got something stable</u>
<u n="310" who="S0037">you can just take it with you</u>
<u n="311" who="S0084">like A I could take it with</u>
<u n="312" who="S0037"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="313" who="S0084">probably not <trunc>t</trunc> internationally <pause dur="short"/> not across the er</u>
<u n="314" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> across the Atlantic <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="315" who="S0084">Atlantic</u>
<u n="316" who="S0037">get the barge involved</u>
<u n="317" who="S0084">how I mean how many miles do you think that is?</u>
<u n="318" who="S0037">Don't know</u>
<u n="319" who="S0084">it's not like the Pacific <pause dur="short"/> I mean that's doable <pause dur="short"/> I mean er it might take six hours to fly across it but <pause dur="short"/> yeah actually if it takes six hours to fly across it <pause dur="short"/> it's probably quite far</u>
<u n="320" who="S0037">mm <pause dur="short"/> it is quite far</u>
<u n="321" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> we won't take the barge to the States</u>
<u n="322" who="S0037">no</u>
<u n="323" who="S0084">maybe around Africa?</u>
<u n="324" who="S0037">somali pirates?</u>
<u n="325" who="S0084">oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> that's not an option <pause dur="short"/> but you can go to Europe</u>
<u n="326" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0084">that'd be quite nice</u>
<u n="328" who="S0037">do you not have to er get them shipped on a bigger ship? Does the barge not have to go inside a bigger ship?</u>
<u n="329" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> I suppose if you import it <pause dur="short"/> which is another viable option <pause dur="short"/> I could just buy a cheap one and get it imported <pause dur="short"/> cos presumaby that'd still be cheaper if it is only two grand</u>
<u n="330" who="S0037">could you not just pay for someone else to get it over here? As in not like undertake this crazy let's go left at the <trunc>Ch</trunc></u>
<u n="331" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="344" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="345" who="S0084">tut <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if this is  if this is  an immediate plan</u>

<u n="360" who="S0037">oh right <pause dur="short"/> that's better</u>

<u n="362" who="S0037">no</u>
<u n="363" who="S0084">us across the Channel</u>
<u n="364" who="S0037">I see</u>

<u n="548" who="S0037">Cos there's too <trunc>h</trunc> too far</u>
<u n="549" who="S0084">I think that's it <pause dur="short"/> and he so he's gonna fly back up to Tokyo and then from Tokyo straight</u>

<u n="555" who="S0084">so it's gonna take <trunc>tw</trunc> yeah like twenty hours or something</u>
<u n="556" who="S0037">Cos when my friend</u>
<u n="557" who="S0084">uh</u>
<u n="558" who="S0037">lived in New Zealand she tried all different routes <pause dur="short"/> like cos New Zealand's like practically as far away as you can get <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="559" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="560" who="S0037">she did like Cape Town to New Zealand <pause dur="short"/> and er you know like Dubai to Australia to New Zealand <pause dur="short"/> or</u>
<u n="561" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="562" who="S0037">like er <trunc>y</trunc> um tut somewhere on the west coast of America <pause dur="short"/> can't even remember where</u>
<u n="563" who="S0084">lA <pause dur="short"/> they go via LA</u>
<u n="564" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> lA</u>
<u n="565" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="566" who="S0037">that way <pause dur="short"/> it's just like</u>
<u n="567" who="S0084">and then er they do Hong Kong <pause dur="short"/> cos when I went out I went with Emirates <pause dur="short"/> so they stop in Dubai</u>
<u n="568" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="569" who="S0084">and then so you go to Dubai Australia and then New Zealand</u>
<u n="570" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="571" who="S0084">and that's er it's just such a bitch <pause dur="short"/> cos when you book the flights they say right you'll have a stop-over in Dubai <pause dur="short"/> but because it's for three hours they tell you <pause dur="short"/> but they don't tell you that they you're gonna stop in Australia</u>
<u n="572" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="573" who="S0084">so when I got on the flight from Dubai they were like this is the whatever to Melbourne <pause dur="short"/> I was like holy fuck I'm on the wrong flight</u>
<u n="574" who="S0037">oh no</u>
<u n="575" who="S0084">no no I'm going to New Zealand <pause dur="short"/> and he was like er this is the New Zealand flight <pause dur="short"/> rah rah rah <pause dur="short"/> it's the same plane <pause dur="short"/> and you just um</u>
<u n="576" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="577" who="S0084">you're just having a little hour off</u>
<u n="578" who="S0037">let you off</u>
<u n="579" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="580" who="S0037">let some people off here</u>
<u n="581" who="S0084">the Dubai stop-over was the worst though</u>
<u n="582" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="583" who="S0084">have you flown to Dubai?</u>
<u n="584" who="S0037">no</u>
<u n="585" who="S0084">A you look like you're flying into the water so that's pretty terrifying</u>
<u n="586" who="S0037">yeah?</u>
<u n="587" who="S0084">Cos obviously it's right on the edge</u>
<u n="588" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="589" who="S0084">and maybe it's because there's so many tall buildings or because it's there's a desert there but there's air pockets <pause dur="short"/> so when they try and descend you drop out of the air</u>
<u n="590" who="S0037">oh</u>
<u n="591" who="S0084">and it did this three times on the descent <pause dur="short"/> and er everyone was like huh uh huh <pause dur="short"/> like really on edge <pause dur="short"/> and he obviously thought no I'm not gonna attempt this <pause dur="short"/> so um</u>
<u n="592" who="S0037">pulled up? Wow</u>
<u n="593" who="S0084">ascended <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and then turned around so you're like like that</u>
<u n="594" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="595" who="S0084">everyone's crying at this stage</u>
<u n="596" who="S0037">oh huh</u>
<u n="597" who="S0084">and then tried again and the same thing happened</u>
<u n="598" who="S0037">oh my God</u>
<u n="599" who="S0084">like <trunc>j</trunc> kept dropping out of the air <pause dur="short"/> and some guy said to the air stewardess oh my friend's er really really scared of flying <pause dur="short"/> can you just get him a drink from the bar? Like just to steady his nerves <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> not even don't worry <pause dur="short"/> the pilot knows what he's doing <pause dur="short"/> we're not gonna die <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> so really sympathetic and really helpful</u>
<u n="600" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="601" who="S0084">they were actually usually better than that though <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> third time same thing happens <pause dur="short"/> and he obviously thinks fuck it <pause dur="short"/> I'm gonna have to land <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> it's gonna have to just happen <pause dur="short"/> and so he just keep  keep landing  keep landing <pause dur="short"/> and we hit with a bang <pause dur="short"/> and everyone got off <pause dur="short"/> and I assume wanted to kiss the tarmac <pause dur="short"/> which is what I wanted to do</u>
<u n="602" who="S0037">oh God</u>
<u n="603" who="S0084">and then they're like yeah two hours and then back on the plane</u>
<u n="604" who="S0037"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> whoo whoo</u>
<u n="605" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/> And everyone was like no <pause dur="short"/> that was bad <pause dur="short"/> and then I think it was twelve hours from there to <trunc>Au</trunc> er Melbourne</u>
<u n="606" who="S0037">oh my goodness</u>
<u n="607" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but then you get to go to er amazing places I suppose</u>
<u n="608" who="S0037">that's true</u>
<u n="609" who="S0084">that's why you do it</u>
<u n="610" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> new York'd be so good though for your birthday <pause dur="short"/> you'd be like yay <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="611" who="S0084">tut <pause dur="short"/> it would be <pause dur="short"/> I mean er that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> it'll be full of</u>
<u n="612" who="S0037">would you like save up and do things like buy yourself something from Tiffany's and you know?</u>
<u n="613" who="S0084">I know <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> cos er the hotels <trunc>s</trunc> are really expensive <pause dur="short"/> and I know I went to uni with a girl who lives there and I</u>
<u n="614" who="S0037">can you not stay in a hostel or something? I mean unless er</u>
<u n="615" who="S0084">yeah</u>

<u n="620" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="621" who="S0084">so yeah definitely <pause dur="short"/> I haven't even started looking <pause dur="short"/> so yeah <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> there's no point in booking anything just yet but</u>
<u n="622" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="623" who="S0084">it'd be worth having a look to see what is available <pause dur="short"/> but obviously for that time of year they'll get booked up really quickly</u>
<u n="624" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="625" who="S0084">so I'll have to start looking soon</u>
<u n="626" who="S0037">but I think actually it's funny because the flights I mean it's the same sort of time of year that I went last year <pause dur="short"/> the year before actually</u>
<u n="627" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="628" who="S0037">and like if you go over a weekend it's a lot cheaper</u>

<u n="636" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> exactly <pause dur="short"/> I think I</u>
<u n="637" who="S0084">mm</u>
