<u n="4" who="S0391">he's going the way he knows past <anon type="place"/> <anon type="place"/> <trunc>p</trunc>past the <trunc>airp</trunc> you know where we were the other night? for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="5" who="S0393">he said he said <anon type="place"/> airfield is that what he means when he says the airfield? does he? <pause dur="short"/> is that what they used to call the airport?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0391">no I think that's there as well</u>
<u n="7" who="S0393">the main thing is just to relax because er <pause dur="short"/> we don't start playing till one o'clock</u>
<u n="8" who="S0391">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure they could even hold it up couldn't they?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0393" trans="overlap">it <trunc>w</trunc> it <trunc>w</trunc> it would literally take five minutes</u>
<u n="10" who="S0391">right</u>
<u n="11" who="S0393">to get the those two amps up the stairs right?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0391" trans="overlap">ah right it's just like playing for mass?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0393">it is really they do a tuning up and stuff like that</u>
<u n="14" who="S0391">well the thing is they can easily wait it's not like you've got a registry office spot is it? it's less pressure</u>
<u n="15" who="S0393">yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0391">cos they are already married there's no registrar there <pause dur="short"/> there's no <trunc>si</trunc></u>

<u n="22" who="S0391">this er they they they only went for a small official service to the registry office just before we met them they'd done it two weeks before that or something</u>
<u n="23" who="S0393">right</u>
<u n="24" who="S0391">so that they didn't wanna be bothered with all the official stuff at their wedding</u>
<u n="25" who="S0393">okay</u>
<u n="26" who="S0391">they <trunc>w</trunc> do you see what I mean? they've planned this wedding day themselves sort of celebration <pause dur="short"/> that was today</u>
<u n="27" who="S0393">er so there there won't be a minister or a <unclear/></u>
<event desc="sound of sat nav"/>
<u n="28" who="S0391">no that might fall</u>
<u n="29" who="S0393">yeah that's <unclear>due to fair up</unclear> anyway isn't it?</u>

<u n="31" who="S0393"><unclear>I</unclear></u>
<u n="32" who="S0391">see how clear that is? I'd rather follow that than try a different route</u>
<u n="33" who="S0393">the sat nav?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0391">I'd rather follow the sat nav than try a different route even if the other route was gonna be shorter what would you rather do?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0393">I <trunc>w</trunc> I must admit I would've looked into it beforehand and and found the the quickest route</u>
<u n="36" who="S0391">but you're a navigator</u>
<u n="37" who="S0393">no I'm the guitarist</u>
<u n="38" who="S0391">no you're the navigator as well <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="39" who="S0393">well do you want me to have a look on the atlas?</u>
<u n="40" who="S0391">no cos we know the two routes it's just which one do we take? the easy one following the sat nav</u>
<u n="41" who="S0393">if if you kept on going right? and disobeyed the sat nav</u>
<u n="42" who="S0391" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="43" who="S0393">and went to <anon type="place"/> <anon type="place"/> would the sat nav pick you up and start directing you?</u>

<u n="45" who="S0393">the only thing is</u>
<u n="46" who="S0391" trans="overlap">it would take longer</u>
<u n="47" who="S0393" trans="overlap">yeah as I that's what I'm saying</u>
<u n="48" who="S0391" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="49" who="S0393">because er often people who take as I have done in the past it doesn't end up being shorter does it?</u>
<u n="50" who="S0391">no</u>
<u n="51" who="S0393" trans="overlap">just take shorter in miles but longer in time</u>
<u n="52" who="S0391">yeah well that's what <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said he said this way is shorter in miles but longer in time <pause dur="short"/> so for the purpose of this journey I think we should just go the easy longer <unclear>proper</unclear> route</u>
<u n="53" who="S0393" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> there's a kestrel <unclear/></u>

<u n="74" who="S0391"><unclear>mm</unclear>?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0393">oh yeah I know what we'll do we'll tell them I'll just start inventing</u>
<u n="76" who="S0391">oh yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0393">the origins of these dances cos no one knows you know waulking songs?</u>
<u n="78" who="S0391">yeah</u>

<u n="82" who="S0391">yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0393">one of the main ones was when they dyed yarn and all of that in urine</u>
<u n="84" who="S0391" trans="overlap">oh yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0393">to preserve it</u>
<u n="86" who="S0391">yeah</u>
<u n="87" who="S0393">so I'll say this is reciprocating the</u>
<u n="88" who="S0391">yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0393">yeah do you want some of this can before I have a go?</u>
<u n="90" who="S0391">no thanks yeah <pause dur="long"/> that's a good idea to make it specific to this one</u>
<u n="91" who="S0393">I mean they sounded</u>
<u n="92" who="S0391" trans="overlap">it's really good if you can do those poems cos it just lets me find the next dance get the <unclear>moves</unclear> into my head</u>
<u n="93" who="S0393" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="94" who="S0391">gives <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> a break cos it's quite</u>
<u n="95" who="S0393" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="96" who="S0391">physically demanding for him</u>
<u n="97" who="S0393">I've got one by Pablo Neruda</u>

<u n="100" who="S0391">what's that one?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0393">it's er something like let your love be a river you know that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="102" who="S0391" trans="overlap">oh right</u>
<u n="103" who="S0393">there was a Guardian thing where it had they asked modern poets to er write verses about <trunc>w</trunc> for weddings</u>
<u n="104" who="S0391">they've probably I bet there's one they've chosen at least from yours <vocal desc="laugh"/> we'll have to listen to the service</u>
<u n="105" who="S0393" trans="overlap">no cos I avoided the search Google search for wedding</u>
<u n="106" who="S0391" trans="overlap">ah very clever</u>
<u n="107" who="S0393">I went into another one just</u>
<u n="108" who="S0391">very clever</u>
<u n="109" who="S0393" trans="overlap">I knew that would be a bit</u>
<u n="110" who="S0391">having said that</u>
<u n="111" who="S0393">there's a heron</u>
<u n="112" who="S0391">having said that oh yeah <pause dur="short"/> having said that you can't beat the ones at the <anon type="place"/> though you know where they came right down?</u>
<u n="113" who="S0393">that was amazing wasn't it?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0391">having said that I think they would quite like the ones they've chosen for the evening guests <pause dur="short"/> cos it's a different group coming tonight to dance</u>
<u n="115" who="S0393" trans="overlap">do we know how many guests there are?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0391">no they weren't sure at the time were they?</u>
<u n="117" who="S0393">are we dealing in what? a hundred? or two hundred?</u>
<u n="118" who="S0391">I <trunc>thi</trunc> I think he I think he said there was enough for people to go upstairs and downstairs so he envisaged them swapping so probably about seventy or eighty upstairs seventy or eighty downstairs</u>
<u n="119" who="S0393">right yeah it's a lot isn't it?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0391">yeah it is quite a lot <unclear/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0393" trans="overlap">how many were at <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s do?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0391">er about that</u>
<u n="123" who="S0393">hundred and fifty</u>
<u n="124" who="S0391">about that yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0393">right</u>
<u n="126" who="S0391">but a lot of hers have just come to sit down haven't they? <pause dur="short"/> I'm guessing they'll have <unclear/></u>
<u n="127" who="S0393">do you want <unclear>that little bit</unclear> of seven up?</u>
<u n="128" who="S0391">no thanks I'm guessing they'll have <pause dur="short"/> upstairs erm <pause dur="short"/> with a buffet and downstairs with the ceilidh if people don't want to dance or listen to the music they can go and sit upstairs</u>
<u n="129" who="S0393">yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0391">but for the very start it would be nice cos I think there'll be a lot of people for the first dance that's why I'm thinking if we get them into the middle for Circassian Circle we can even have a circle round a circle round a circle we could fit everybody in if they were careful when they go into the middle</u>
<u n="131" who="S0393" trans="overlap">what is that dance? is it quite simple?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0391">that's the simplest</u>
<u n="133" who="S0393">ah good idea to start with it then</u>
<u n="134" who="S0391" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0393">I was thinking maybe why not get them in the circle to start off with?</u>
<u n="136" who="S0391">oh right yeah cos <unclear/> <unclear>gather round in</unclear></u>
<u n="137" who="S0393" trans="overlap">do you without telling them that er just gather round the couple you know</u>
