<u n="1" who="S0521">back cos they delete the numbers from the presumably because they don't want me to do business with the</u>
<u n="2" who="S0519">them directly</u>
<u n="3" who="S0521">directly and so they <unclear/> cut</u>
<u n="4" who="S0520" trans="overlap">oh the agencies yeah</u>
<u n="5" who="S0519">but I don't I don't want to do business with someone <trunc>i</trunc> if I don't know who the firm is</u>
<u n="6" who="S0521">no of course not</u>
<u n="7" who="S0519">cos then you can't google the firm and say how have their removals been you know get reviews on them or whatever</u>
<u n="8" who="S0520">oh no</u>
<u n="9" who="S0519">that's no good at all is it? wish bloody Pickford's'd pitch up and tell us what they want to do</u>
<u n="10" who="S0520">are you waiting to hear from them?</u>
<u n="11" who="S0521">yes</u>
<u n="12" who="S0519">they're not in your junk mail?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0521">no mm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0519">how are your boys then?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/> they are my boys those two we always work the three of us a lot because <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s the man in charge and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is needed for everything really and is consulted for everything because he's very wise and he always thinks of things in a really clever way he's just good at stuff</u>
<u n="16" who="S0521" trans="overlap">sounds</u>
<u n="17" who="S0520"><trunc>s</trunc> and I do all of the texts which is almost always something involved and all of the graphics so whenever we launch something <pause dur="short"/> we're like a little triangle of getting you know <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> kind of is initiating it all and also making it you know being a quality controller really and asking <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> if necessary what he thinks about A B or C and how we should present things and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is er is the mm sort of implementer so anyway yeah they're good <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm it's a lot of things always it's a lot of you know what it's like in there's a lot of small things that need doing and erm problems that you have to kind of solve along the way and excuse me and er and you know we just <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> recently wrote an email to everybody because we used to be a small very small group of us really doing these retreats and it was just a few times a year and it was <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> almost did everything at that time himself and you know we've just expanded everything and there's a really lot of retreats as you know</u>
<u n="18" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="19" who="S0520">and in India it's a community really it's not a retreat it's quite a long period of time and there's a huge amount of administration that comes with it and then on my side you know all the books and the website and texts and videos and erm all kind of variety of erm of presenting information really and knowledge and so it's a huge thing and a lot of people are involved you know so it's just like <trunc>ta</trunc> you know as anything does you know it kind of grows organically if people are motivated to but it <trunc>y</trunc><trunc>y</trunc>yeah we have we were carrying a very large portion of the work the three of us and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and we still are because you know there's always you know the people who are the most involved and the most in charge but we've tried to initiate a process now where other people are contributing a lot more so that it's kind of more democratic</u>
<u n="20" who="S0519" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="21" who="S0520">not democratic what's the word? just shared really <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s really good at it she's a delegator I like to sort of sit in my little office and do everything <trunc>fo</trunc> for myself you know so I had to learn to mm delegate this things to other people and er <pause dur="long"/> be be a <trunc>facili</trunc> like more a facilitator and supervise everything and check that it's done properly but not be the one doing it you know? I'm like a little one-man band <vocal desc="laugh"/> at the moment or have been and erm so that's quite fun it's nice to change things I really like working with both of them it's a lot of fun they're very different <pause dur="long"/> mm erm but now also with this girlfriend on the scene she's erm she can do a lot of stuff and she's you know the fact that they're together is a huge help because like if you do design things he'll I'll design it in Photoshop and then he'll erm programme it in HTML and whatever blah blah computer speak translate it into a web page program it and then it'll come out really squiffy usually you know and then you have to look at it and say that space needs to be bigger</u>
<u n="22" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="23" who="S0520">that needs to be further away from that and that element doesn't work and then you have to make it live so whenever someone's hovering over the page you know with web pages things happen to show you</u>
<u n="24" who="S0519" trans="overlap">happen</u>
<u n="25" who="S0520">that you can click</u>
<u n="26" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="27" who="S0520">for instance if you go over a link usually it changes colour or it bounces or it gets bigger or something erm and whatever things move and are responsive so all of those things <trunc>a</trunc>are in addition to just the sort of flat design</u>
<u n="28" who="S0519" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0520">and normally the two of us are trying to do it over Skype you know with erm looking not quite looking at the same thing and all you want to do is sit in front of same screen and go try this try this try this</u>
<u n="30" who="S0519">mm and then she can do that</u>
<u n="31" who="S0520">so she can do all of that yeah cos they're anyway together</u>
<u n="32" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0520">and she's got a good eye for things and erm <pause dur="short"/> and that's all good news and also it means cos the the website you know we did a huge project setting it up and when once it's been set up we've hardly touched it and it's supposed to be an alive thing</u>
<u n="34" who="S0519">yeah ongoing</u>
<u n="35" who="S0520">and it's mostly</u>
<u n="36" who="S0519">it's really really <trunc>ha</trunc> you you actually need somebody to just do that all the time</u>
<u n="37" who="S0520" trans="overlap">their permanent job see that's none of our permanent jobs it's like our <trunc>li</trunc> it's our like back</u>
<u n="38" who="S0519">the lowest on your list</u>
<u n="39" who="S0520">always usually cos there are live things happening you know like now we're doing this and you always there's a project going on I have three book four books going on at the moment</u>
<u n="40" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0520">and so we never get round to it and it's a pity because for the majority of people that's exactly where they're going to come in touch with the teaching they're going to go on the website they're going to read that that's going to be their constant contact with it</u>
<u n="42" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0520">so really it should be our priority</u>
<u n="44" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0520">so I'm thinking now that I would like to set her up as kind of the one who would develop it all graphically</u>
<u n="46" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="47" who="S0520">and erm there's another boy <trunc>ss</trunc> who's a Swiss guy who's also likes to do graphics and is learning how to use the programs and he seems really good and he's erm just like an incredible precisionist which is really nice to have because I don't have it at all</u>
<u n="48" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0520">so when I do design work I quite like good at the think up an idea bit and have you know I can kind of make things looks nice but I don't ever go into the nitty-gritty and if you look at good design it's usually done by someone extremely pedantic cos it's all erm mathematical really so he made for us a big logo of the teaching for the hall erm printed on a kind of a canvas you know which we hang kind of at the <trunc>fro</trunc> at the top of the hall when you go in and er it's just beautiful and you can't even say why</u>
<u n="50" who="S0519">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0520">but he worked on the erm original scan of the logo and just went into detail pixel pixels detail and went sort of smoothed certain things over and chose like slightly different colours for the and it was just lovely yeah so</u>
<u n="52" who="S0519">amazing talent</u>
<u n="53" who="S0520">yeah he's really good at that he's that nature of person but he could be definitely involved as well <pause dur="short"/> on the website <pause dur="long"/> so when is your competition for the choir?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0519">end of October last weekend in October</u>
<u n="55" who="S0520">so it won't be interfered with by all the moving and stuff? mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0519">and the <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> following weekend is a a competition in in Wales <unclear/></u>
<u n="57" who="S0520">a real one or just that you're going to be the victory team?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0519" trans="overlap">a real one oh I don't know</u>
<u n="59" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0519">but erm yeah I don't know it's a proper</u>
<u n="61" who="S0520">no I meant real as in you're actually competing you're not just going to</u>
<u n="62" who="S0519" trans="overlap">we're competing no no no no we're not just going to show off</u>
<u n="63" who="S0520" trans="overlap">have a jolly and show off yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/> it'll be fun to go there and not have to compete for the big for the main one</u>
<u n="64" who="S0519" trans="overlap">yeah no very exciting</u>
<u n="65" who="S0520" trans="overlap">mm be a lark well you have to sing and you have to be graded don't you?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0519">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0520">so it's not without pressure</u>
<u n="68" who="S0519">no and that's at like nine o'clock in the morning so that's not jolly either</u>
<u n="69" who="S0520" trans="overlap">done and dusted oh but yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0519">erm and then the next morning we it's called sing with the champs erm that's at nine o'clock in the morning as well <vocal desc="laugh"/> please</u>
<u n="71" who="S0520">hate doing things at nine o'clock in the morning anything</u>
<u n="72" who="S0519">and erm and then I'll we do our sort of it's kind of terrible slot really they took us out of the show and put us as to sing four songs while people are waiting for the results and frankly they don't give a damn</u>
<u n="73" who="S0520"><vocal desc="laugh"/> my dear Scarlett</u>
<u n="74" who="S0519">erm yeah yeah I mean they're waiting for the results they don't want to see some other choir singing who aren't even in it</u>
<u n="75" who="S0520">they just want to</u>
<u n="76" who="S0519">they just want to know</u>
<u n="77" who="S0520">they're just distracted</u>
<u n="78" who="S0519">but anyway that's what we're doing</u>
<u n="79" who="S0520">well it's always good experience to perform the songs cos it's completely different isn't it?</u>
<u n="80" who="S0519" trans="overlap">oh yes I don't mind at all I you know but that's our our job and then we're on the doors and you know we have other jobs</u>
