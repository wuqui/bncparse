<u n="312" who="S0115">chilli and and alcohol is is uh</u>
<u n="313" who="S0037">bit difficult <pause dur="short"/> but I find chilli and chocolate difficult</u>
<u n="314" who="S0115" trans="overlap">it's tough <pause dur="short"/> ginger though fresh ginger in uh in uh what like gin was it? Or vodka?</u>
<u n="315" who="S0037">no it was vodka <pause dur="short"/> that was when <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> came before</u>
<u n="316" who="S0115" trans="overlap">put <trunc>ging</trunc> put fresh ginger in the vodka <pause dur="short"/> then you have that with lemonade <pause dur="short"/> and the fizz</u>

<u n="326" who="S0115">uh perfuse or infuse or diffuse or whatever the word is</u>
<u n="327" who="S0037">probably all of those <pause dur="short"/> hey where d'you wanna go on Friday have you thought any more? Or d'you wanna get something and eat it in?</u>
<u n="328" who="S0115" trans="overlap">that's that's our anniversary innit um <pause dur="short"/> well there's <pause dur="short"/> split split between like</u>
<u n="329" who="S0037" trans="overlap">Cos I do still <pause dur="short"/> I am</u>
<u n="330" who="S0115">going out and we can go the Algerian restaurant <pause dur="short"/> which is called uh Al Kasbah I don't know if there's any other similar restaurants to that <pause dur="short"/> on the the other hand</u>
<u n="331" who="S0037" trans="overlap">there's loads down there</u>
<u n="332" who="S0115">on the <trunc>n</trunc> on the other hand might be able to get better ingredients ourselves and attempt to make something</u>
<u n="333" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="334" who="S0115">good ourselves and then</u>
<u n="335" who="S0037">Cos that paella was really good <pause dur="short"/> I really <trunc>en</trunc> I really enjoyed that</u>
<u n="336" who="S0115" trans="overlap">could have like a lamb could like could make a lamb tagine</u>
<u n="337" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> because like we um <pause dur="short"/> You know for the <trunc>m</trunc> like on Valentines Day for the money that we spent like <pause dur="short"/> You know if we'd gone out and had like a three course dinner and drinks and stuff we would have spent way more than I spent at the shop</u>
<u n="338" who="S0115">yeah I mean um <pause dur="short"/> it's it's I think with restaurants the the the <trunc>s</trunc></u>
<u n="339" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but it is nice</u>
<u n="340" who="S0115" trans="overlap">the the advantage of a restaurant is that you <trunc>g</trunc> you get the atmosphere and</u>
<u n="341" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0115">get to be served by the people and you can have drinks and stuff and <pause dur="short"/> I mean you can then go directly to the pub afterwards a lot but</u>
<u n="343" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I think  I think  we should probably go out because it would be nice to be like we never go to Mill Road round there <pause dur="short"/> cos it's too far</u>
<u n="344" who="S0115">well we <pause dur="short"/> we do sometimes I think that's it's me a different preference</u>
<u n="345" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah but rarely like</u>
<u n="346" who="S0115">like if it was up to me I think I'd probably go more often over there</u>
<u n="347" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it's quite far though</u>
<u n="348" who="S0115">it's just a different preference for us <pause dur="short"/> I don't find it <pause dur="short"/> I don't really mind that much because cos there are many pubs on the way back so you could easily break break the journey on the way back</u>
<u n="349" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I suppose</u>
<u n="350" who="S0115">I mean there is a bit of a problem round here obviously is that a lot of the pubs here close at twelve so if you were going out late somewhere and then coming back then you couldn't stop anywhere anywhere in this northern</u>
<u n="351" who="S0037" trans="overlap">on the way back no <pause dur="short"/> that's what I mean yeah</u>
<u n="352" who="S0115">northern central ring of Cambridge but <pause dur="short"/> there's a couple of places you can stop on in town <pause dur="short"/> in the centre of town</u>
<u n="353" who="S0037">yeah but it's still like a fair old walk from there to here</u>
<u n="354" who="S0115">well yeah but I don't personally mind</u>
<u n="355" who="S0037" trans="overlap">suppose you could get a taxi</u>
<u n="356" who="S0115">but yeah of course a taxi back</u>
<u n="357" who="S0037">but um</u>
<u n="358" who="S0115">and that's what <pause dur="short"/> I think a lot of people would do that like but I don't mind walking really <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="359" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="360" who="S0115">but yeah if we we go out and then sort of <trunc>en</trunc> enjoy that sort of atmosphere that we've got a lot of <trunc>choo</trunc> a lot of different restaurants to choose from</u>
<u n="361" who="S0037" trans="overlap">so d'you think we should do that then?</u>
<u n="362" who="S0115">uh but uh but on the other hand obviously it's good to make your own stuff because then you can can get more more quality food perhaps than a restaurant</u>
<u n="363" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but I <trunc>th</trunc> I think I worry that I would like <pause dur="short"/> I would get relaxed at home and like not want to go out or if we did I would just come down here or</u>
<u n="364" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well um <pause dur="short"/> well I mean once again that's up to <trunc>y</trunc> that's up to uh personal choice like I think I</u>
<u n="365" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I wouldn't be like Okay I've just had a giant meal let's walk all the way over into town <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="366" who="S0115" trans="overlap">I mean I think  I think  I'd probably be more like that but</u>
<u n="367" who="S0037">yeah but I know I mean me like I dunno if I would</u>
<u n="368" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah I mean it's it's it's up to preference isn't it? Um <pause dur="short"/> uh</u>
<u n="369" who="S0037">dunno if I would <pause dur="short"/> quite lazy</u>
<u n="370" who="S0115" trans="overlap">but I think once again with a restaurant like if you've you've <trunc>ea</trunc> you don't wanna eat too much anyway because in a restaurant you're like if you go out for a Indian and you have a whole balti or something</u>
<u n="371" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know what you mean <pause dur="short"/> it <trunc>get</trunc> ruins your night</u>
<u n="372" who="S0115" trans="overlap">like all that sort of uh <pause dur="short"/> all the oil that's in the uh balti</u>
<u n="373" who="S0037">that's why I don't like getting like set menus cos I just think</u>
<u n="374" who="S0115" trans="overlap">whatever what's whatever your favourite Indian is is a pathia or something?</u>
<u n="375" who="S0037">I like a pathia I like a dansak</u>
<u n="376" who="S0115">dansak the Persian one</u>
<u n="377" who="S0037">actually I like I think I probably like the sides better I think I would <pause dur="short"/> I would probably like just <trunc>t</trunc> like <pause dur="short"/> maybe I should get like a <trunc>tha</trunc> is it called a Thali? Tali?</u>
<u n="378" who="S0115">thali is um is like like a</u>
<u n="379" who="S0037" trans="overlap">Cos then you get a few little</u>
<u n="380" who="S0115">Tapas style dish with lots of little bits</u>
<u n="381" who="S0037">because then like I think I <pause dur="short"/> it's just <pause dur="short"/> I get <pause dur="short"/> I like it when you have lots of different things <pause dur="short"/> I like the side dishes better actually sag paneer <pause dur="short"/> my ultimate all-time favourite <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Although</u>
