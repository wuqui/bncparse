<u n="10" who="S0369">mm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0251"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> oh well never mind</u>
<u n="12" who="S0368">ah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="13" who="S0369">was you pleased to see that this popped up <pause dur="short"/> in the paper?</u>

<u n="15" who="S0369">mm</u>
<u n="16" who="S0251">cos erm we were looking at them last night and I was upstairs and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said ooh there's one of your questions in the paper</u>
<u n="17" who="S0369">mm hm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0251">oh right <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="long"/> the controversy started extra quickly</u>
<u n="19" who="S0368">yes well</u>

<u n="27" who="S0369">right what's <pause dur="short"/> like the the Telegraph's <pause dur="short"/> what is it consensus of is it a <pause dur="short"/> a tricky question?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="29" who="S0369">or is it straight forward like? <pause dur="short"/> well not straightforward but</u>
<u n="30" who="S0251">mm <pause dur="short"/> I think their implication is that it's erm a more challenging question</u>
<u n="31" who="S0369">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0251">but then the paper's usually saying ooh they've been dumbed down too many people are getting <pause dur="short"/> high grades so whatever you do you're not going to win are you?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0369" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> no the journalists <pause dur="short"/> the journalists <pause dur="short"/> they're not going to let something get in the way of a controversial story</u>
<u n="34" who="S0251">no</u>

<u n="38" who="S0368">mm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0369">but <pause dur="short"/> er there was quite a number <pause dur="short"/> at least a dozen people had tweeted or wrote in about <pause dur="short"/> the <pause dur="short"/> the way <pause dur="short"/> the BBC news had portrayed Charles Kennedy's demise</u>
<u n="40" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="41" who="S0369">by mentioning <pause dur="short"/> a lot about his alcohol <pause dur="short"/> er</u>

<u n="43" who="S0369">demons and what have you</u>
<u n="44" who="S0251" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>

<u n="46" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="47" who="S0369">so <pause dur="short"/> they <pause dur="short"/> they then had to bring out they always have to bring somebody out from</u>
<u n="48" who="S0251" trans="overlap">mm hm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0369">their the they brought out the journalist editor and he has the title of <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> obituary controller</u>
<u n="50" who="S0251">oh <unclear/></u>
<u n="51" who="S0369">of the BBC</u>
<u n="52" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0369">in other words the head man who and <pause dur="short"/> they they sort of in a way do these obituaries before it happens</u>
<u n="54" who="S0251">yes</u>
<u n="55" who="S0369">cos there's been another incident which</u>
<u n="56" who="S0251" trans="overlap">about the queen <vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0369" trans="overlap">yes which I will go on to but anyhow <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> he said that it was well known <pause dur="short"/> er Kennedy's alcoholism</u>
<u n="58" who="S0251">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0369">and er <pause dur="short"/> you know he had to defend it and I thought he he defended it very good but there's always these people</u>
<u n="60" who="S0251">oh yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0369">who are going to <pause dur="short"/> come <pause dur="short"/> come at you from</u>

<u n="65" who="S0369" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0368">it was self-inflicted</u>
<u n="67" who="S0369">he said it was well known <pause dur="short"/> and on top of that his his wife had said that that was the cause of it really</u>
<u n="68" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="69" who="S0369">and er <pause dur="short"/> it it was <pause dur="short"/> people were saying that alcoholism is an illness <pause dur="short"/> and he said it is not an illness such as er <pause dur="short"/> cancer <pause dur="short"/> or er er <pause dur="short"/> well he mentioned something else</u>
<u n="70" who="S0251">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0369">he said <pause dur="short"/> it's it's what you do to yourself <pause dur="short"/> it's almost self-inflicted <pause dur="short"/> and it's right isn't it?</u>
<u n="72" who="S0251">mm except it's more psychological really because then they're in the grips of an addiction it's like smoking</u>
<u n="73" who="S0369">mm well this is it but <pause dur="short"/> er <pause dur="short"/> like lung cancer the big cause of lung cancer or one of the big <trunc>ca</trunc> is smoking</u>
