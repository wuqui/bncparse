<u n="1323" who="S0018">oh do you know what I did though? Er cos I mean when you're in the booth you have to have about five different thought processes going on at the <trunc>f</trunc> at the same time <pause dur="short"/> you have to have memory for what's just been said while you're translating the bit that came before <pause dur="short"/> your brain has to be translating the bit that came before <pause dur="short"/> so you</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0047">mm</u>
<u n="1325" who="S0018">listening attending to the Spanish and then your French <pause dur="short"/> and then your brain's working it out in Spanish</u>
<u n="1326" who="S0047">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0018">at the same time you have to be listening ahead <pause dur="short"/> and then at the same time you have to be speaking <pause dur="short"/> and oh my life <pause dur="short"/> I did about the first three sentences</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0047">that's er</u>

<u n="1346" who="S0047">er you <trunc>focu</trunc> you you you sort of think Spanish don't you <pause dur="short"/> you when you <trunc>s</trunc> when you get to a certain stage in Spanish you start to think <trunc>Sp</trunc> in Spanish don't you</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0018">hm</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0047">that's the that's when you know you're getting somewhere <pause dur="short"/> but to then to think in Spanish and French <pause dur="short"/> so <vocal desc="laugh"/> and then</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0018">which I can do fine when it's no pressure</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0047">er so well you cos you see you probably have to go through in your head to Spanish to English then to French</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0018">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0047"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1353" who="S0018">no I can do straight from Spanish to French</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0047">can you go across? Yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0018">Cos they're quite similar</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0047">yeah</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0018">I can translate between them <pause dur="short"/> but er you know in a informal environment <pause dur="short"/> there were three hundred people in that room <pause dur="short"/> all turning round to look at me in my little booth <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1358" who="S0047">them Senegalese though they can they tend to speak a lot of <trunc>lang</trunc> they can <trunc>s</trunc> nearly always speak obviously French and English</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0047">and they've got a couple of tribal languages <pause dur="short"/> quite a few I met a <trunc>coup</trunc> mind you they were in Spain who could speak Spanish</u>
<u n="1361" who="S0018">mhm</u>
<u n="1362" who="S0047">senegalese <pause dur="short"/> they could speak Spanish <pause dur="short"/> they got Spanish English French and like well what tribal language? Well they can do whatever I dunno two or three tribal languages</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0047">as well <pause dur="short"/> amazing</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0018">I think people who grow up in a country that has got a lot of languages within that country they're more open to</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0047">mm</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0018">learning languages and picking it up <pause dur="short"/> I mean in England people are awful about learning languages aren't they</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0047">in England it's really bad isn't it</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0018"><vocal desc="cough"/> mm</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0047">really bad <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0018">but I guess everyone around the world speaks English so they don't feel</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0047">no</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0018">that they need to learn</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0047">but it's just courteous isn't it <pause dur="short"/> we should you should like and it's the education system <pause dur="short"/> there's not enough teachers <pause dur="short"/> or that's the excuse <pause dur="short"/> they should that shouldn't prevail now <pause dur="short"/> there should be plenty of well Polish and Romanians</u>
<u n="1375" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1376" who="S0047">to teach to learn <pause dur="short"/> well well certainly German <pause dur="short"/> there's I imagine that most Polish people speak German can't they</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0018">mm</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0047">and we've got um I I would've thought there was enough people now to teach <pause dur="short"/> but that's always been the excuse <pause dur="short"/> there's not enough teachers</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0018">well I think the problem is that you know they're trying to teach classes of thirty kids at a time</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0047">mm</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0018">so you're not actually teaching how to communicate in the language <pause dur="short"/> you're just teaching the academic nature of the language <pause dur="short"/> like the studying of the vocabulary <pause dur="short"/> and grammar <pause dur="short"/> and kids just don't see you know they have to work really really hard memorizing things <pause dur="short"/> and they don't get a feeling that like they're learning anything or they can use it</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0047">mm</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0018">they don't see an objective <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="1384" who="S0047">they're not motivated are they</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0018">exactly <pause dur="short"/> and as soon as you lose them they're gone</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0047">mm</u>
<u n="1387" who="S0018">and they er they have no mm they take no joy in it <pause dur="short"/> they don't</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0047">mm</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0018">enjoy the whole</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0047">I did <pause dur="short"/> I used to enjoy er well it was only French and a little bit of Latin <pause dur="short"/> but I've learnt all my <trunc>m</trunc> I've learnt more since <trunc>l</trunc> you know <trunc>re</trunc> in recent years than I ever did at school <pause dur="short"/> so in er er</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0018">what from travelling around?</u>
<u n="1392" who="S0047">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well just just just just like from going to night school and going yeah from CDs and that and</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0018">mhm</u>

<u n="1401" who="S0018">cool</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0047">but I found that  that I found that  like frustrating cos I think most of the people who go there go for social reasons rather than actually to learn to speak the language</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0018">really?</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0047">and I think also they teach you er er they teach you more on <trunc>grammatic</trunc> <trunc>gramm</trunc> <trunc>grammati</trunc> <trunc>grammatica</trunc> and that <pause dur="short"/> rather than how to speak <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> all I wanna do is learn how to speak it <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> not</u>
<u n="1405" who="S0018">yeah</u>

<u n="1414" who="S0047">it doesn't work like that though <pause dur="short"/> it's all about hard work if you wanna learn</u>
<u n="1415" who="S0018">it's like the keep fit videos that I buy</u>
<u n="1416" who="S0047">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I yeah er</u>
<u n="1417" who="S0018">I've got so many keep fit DVDs</u>

<u n="1429" who="S0018">yeah</u>
<u n="1430" who="S0047">but <trunc>obv</trunc> obviously the best thing of all is actually speaking and going being there</u>
<u n="1431" who="S0018">definitely</u>
<u n="1432" who="S0047">speaking the language</u>
