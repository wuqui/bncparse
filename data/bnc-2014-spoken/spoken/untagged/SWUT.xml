<u n="5" who="S0202">mm <vocal desc="misc"/> can I have a light please? cheers <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="6" who="S0208">oh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> you are cursed</u>
<u n="7" who="S0202">I know</u>
<u n="8" who="S0208">no damage done though</u>
<u n="9" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="10" who="S0208">just a bit sticky</u>
<u n="11" who="S0202">be alright</u>
<u n="12" who="S0208"><vocal desc="laugh"/> be alright <pause dur="short"/> oh it's quite lovely out here actually</u>
<u n="13" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="14" who="S0208">it's a nice temperature</u>
<u n="15" who="S0202">I might have toothache</u>
<u n="16" who="S0208">oh</u>
<u n="17" who="S0202">cos I'm eating on that side all time cos I'm I'm sick of getting stuff stuck in that one</u>
<u n="18" who="S0208">yeah mm <pause dur="short"/> I found one of those little brushes I was telling you about remember the ones I used to get food out for</u>
<u n="19" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="20" who="S0208">when I had my braces? it's in the erm toothbrush pot in the bathroom</u>
<u n="21" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="22" who="S0208">just give the tip a little wash</u>
<u n="23" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="24" who="S0208">but I wash it every time I've used it anyway and that's really good because it's so thin</u>
<u n="25" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0208">with the long handle you can</u>
<u n="27" who="S0202">get in there</u>
<u n="28" who="S0208">get in there <pause dur="long"/> ah it sounds really lame but <pause dur="short"/> I'm really looking forward to <pause dur="short"/> when we get back and like all of our stuff's been moved in I'm really looking forward to looking through all my toiletries and then going on a shop</u>
<u n="29" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0208" trans="overlap">for what I need <pause dur="short"/> getting all my creams and all my shampoos</u>
<u n="31" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0208">cos I know I know</u>
<u n="33" who="S0202" trans="overlap">I</u>
<u n="34" who="S0208">I have like shampoo and stuff left over but it's in a bag somewhere <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="35" who="S0202">yeah I must admit I'm looking forward to like getting my stuff in</u>
<u n="36" who="S0208">I know</u>
<u n="37" who="S0202">and like moving in properly</u>
<u n="38" who="S0208" trans="overlap">it's I'm getting so excited now that it's getting closer</u>
<u n="39" who="S0202">yeah me too</u>
<u n="40" who="S0208" trans="overlap">like it feels more real <pause dur="short"/> cos like I'm so nervous about how the first part's gonna pan out but I was exactly the same this year I <trunc>ha</trunc> I used to walk around with a map of the campus and I would check where every single erm thing was before I'd leave so I knew where I was going</u>
<u n="41" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0208">but cos I'm quite a panicky person as you know <pause dur="short"/> but at least that's done it's just like getting the buses and stuff <pause dur="short"/> but I reckon the first few trips if you're up for it we should go in together</u>
<u n="43" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0208">like hopefully we'll have roughly the same timetable but if you start a little bit earlier than me then I'll come in with you and I'll just hang around then at least the first few times then we're not making the journey alone</u>
<u n="45" who="S0202" trans="overlap">get some work done</u>
<u n="46" who="S0208">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="47" who="S0202" trans="overlap">just get some work done like when you're there do some reading like</u>
<u n="48" who="S0208" trans="overlap">and then at least we're not doing the journeys alone</u>
<u n="49" who="S0202">cos er my days are pretty full like my whole week <pause dur="short"/> is pretty full my timetable like I go from one lecture to another blah blah erm and but the in some of them I'll have gaps so in them gaps I have I'm just gonna go to the library</u>
<u n="50" who="S0208">mm</u>
<u n="51" who="S0202">and just do the reading that I need to do</u>
<u n="52" who="S0208">I'm going to do that as well</u>
<u n="53" who="S0202" trans="overlap">I'm gonna have like a strict schedule next year of reading and I'm gonna fucking do it cos this year I did no reading whatsoever and I really like struggled</u>
<u n="54" who="S0208">but it's gonna be easier for us to do that because thinking about it <pause dur="short"/> you can't just walk home</u>
<u n="55" who="S0202">no</u>
<u n="56" who="S0208">and there's no point getting a bus in a few times a day that'll be expensive before we get bus passes and stuff</u>
<u n="57" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0208">and time consuming so I reckon that hopefully my timetable will be a little bit better this year <pause dur="short"/> as in like it won't just be hours here and there because first semester was awful I mean I was literally there were some days when I was in for just an hour</u>
<u n="59" who="S0202">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's stupid innit?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0208" trans="overlap">whereas second semester was really good because I got two days off but the three days that was in were were like practically full</u>
<u n="61" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0208">so I'm hoping it's gonna be a bit more like that now so that I can go in for a whole day <pause dur="short"/> and not have to go in for halves and stuff</u>
<u n="63" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="64" who="S0208" trans="overlap">like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s timetable was absolutely perfect like she's in full time two days a week full full time like</u>
<u n="65" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0208" trans="overlap">from nine o'clock in the morning till five o'clock at night</u>
<u n="67" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="68" who="S0208">like school <pause dur="short"/> but that means that she doesn't go in for nothing</u>
<u n="69" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="70" who="S0208">and I I want it to be like that but I'm gonna go to the library way more</u>
<u n="71" who="S0202">yeah me too</u>
<u n="72" who="S0208" trans="overlap">to do my work and stuff <pause dur="short"/> have to try and find my student card</u>
<u n="73" who="S0202">how much did you get deducted from your rent then? for your deposit?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0208">er <pause dur="short"/> twenty something quid</u>
<u n="75" who="S0202">is that it?</u>
<u n="76" who="S0208">yeah I got a hundred and seventy something back I think a hundred and seventy-one so not much at all but I think that was just for the burn marks that were in the chairs cos to be honest nothing was damaged and it</u>
<u n="77" who="S0202" trans="overlap">they must have cleaned it</u>
<u n="78" who="S0208" trans="overlap">they obviously cleaned it like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> did say that they were gonna clean it and I wouldn't lose any money and from that side of things I haven't but the</u>
<u n="79" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0208" trans="overlap">burn marks on chairs like even though I wasn't in that flat and it's not my fault it's you know I'm not gonna</u>
<u n="81" who="S0202">it would the <trunc>ha</trunc> it'd be a hassle like</u>
<u n="82" who="S0208">I'm not gonna go to everyone and say like give me ten pound each or like a fiver each or something that's ridiculous</u>
<u n="83" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="84" who="S0208">it's twenty something quid but</u>
<u n="85" who="S0202" trans="overlap">well we're not gonna have that problem this year so</u>
<u n="86" who="S0208">no once I get my next bit of rent sorted I'm gonna sort my finances out once you leave with my dad and stuff</u>
<u n="87" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0208">so that I can get it set up until my student loan comes in with cos I'm gonna pay the rent every month</u>
<u n="89" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0208">I think that'll be much easier for me to do <pause dur="short"/> erm and then once I know how much money I've got I'm gonna make a budget and then give my dad back the exact amount that hundred and seventy-one pound cos he cos I didn't have my loan obviously when I had to put the deposit down he paid for it <pause dur="short"/> and he said it's not a problem that he doesn't want it back but I told him from the start that he was gonna get that back so</u>
<u n="91" who="S0202" trans="overlap">yeah you're not giving him the two full the full two hundred?</u>
<u n="92" who="S0208">well he doesn't want it</u>
<u n="93" who="S0202">oh okay</u>
<u n="94" who="S0208">cos it got deducted <pause dur="short"/> but I mean if I can then I will</u>
<u n="95" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0208">I'm gonna have a look at how much money I have I might just pay him in like little instalments</u>
<u n="97" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0208">and he can take it out of my euros that I have</u>
<u n="99" who="S0202">how much euros have you got saved up now like?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0208">four hundred and something</u>
<u n="101" who="S0202">oh that's good</u>
<u n="102" who="S0208">yeah but that's gonna go towards a cost of living</u>
<u n="103" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="104" who="S0208">like for September that's gonna go towards my rent <pause dur="long"/> so I have enough to pay September <pause dur="short"/> erm and then what's left I'll use that extra one hundred as living off until my student loan comes through</u>
<u n="105" who="S0202">yeah well your student loan comes back comes in the day after you land in England so you won't be waiting long for it</u>
<u n="106" who="S0208">exactly <pause dur="short"/> erm cos then with the student loan I'll be able to get through October and November and probably December and still have enough to live with</u>
<u n="107" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0208">and then <pause dur="short"/> I think I'm just gonna work it out with my dad that I've got some money in my French account that he says he'll push over to me and then once the money starts coming through from the French student finance what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get him to transfer me just a bit over from the French account that I need for rent</u>
<u n="109" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0208">and then use my student loan to <trunc>b</trunc> like to live off</u>
<u n="111" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0208">so my French money's gonna pay for rent hopefully</u>
<u n="113" who="S0202">just remember that it three hundred and ninety-one pound and three pence or something ridiculous like that comes out at the twenty-second of every month</u>
<u n="114" who="S0208">I'm gonna get my dad to</u>
<u n="115" who="S0202" trans="overlap">so you need to remember</u>
<u n="116" who="S0208" trans="overlap">always transfer four hundred</u>
<u n="117" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0208">cos then that's exactly for rent</u>
<u n="119" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="120" who="S0208">and then I can use my student loan myself</u>
<u n="121" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0208">but I'm gonna give the student finance a ring erm probably not today but tomorrow</u>
<u n="123" who="S0202">it's an 0845 number it's gonna cost you fortune from here</u>
<u n="124" who="S0208">no no the <trunc>Eng</trunc> er French one</u>
<u n="125" who="S0202">oh the French one okay</u>
<u n="126" who="S0208">yeah just to make sure that everything is intact because erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s gotten a few emails from them since this summer <pause dur="short"/> but the email that I got he only just received</u>
<u n="127" who="S0202">right okay</u>
<u n="128" who="S0208">so I just wanna make sure that because I'm not living in France and stuff they might have just sent me the email straight away of confirmation and I'm not gonna get any other emails cos I'm not living in France</u>
<u n="129" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0208">I'm hoping that's the case because if if they <unclear/> me out of that money again <pause dur="short"/> cos last year I lost out on a few thousand <pause dur="short"/> I won't be able to survive the year if I don't get the French money though that's for damn sure <pause dur="long"/> I mean I have a little bit saved up but <pause dur="short"/> that four hundred or whatever is not gonna last long</u>
<u n="131" who="S0202">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well it's one month's rent innit?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0208">exactly it's not even money to live off <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="133" who="S0202">you should talk to <anon type="place"/> finance as well <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="134" who="S0208">give them a ring when I get back to England</u>
<u n="135" who="S0202">mm <pause dur="short"/> like or <anon type="place"/> uni</u>
<u n="136" who="S0208">yeah I'm gonna have a look at any kind of help that I can get though because</u>
<u n="137" who="S0202" trans="overlap">well ring them before you leave because it's a house er number anyway so it'll be free</u>
<u n="138" who="S0208">mm</u>
<u n="139" who="S0202">so ring you when you sort your finances out with your dad</u>
<u n="140" who="S0208">yeah I'll do all of that with my dad I'll take a day out to do that</u>
<u n="141" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="142" who="S0208">as long as I do get the money from France though I know everything will be fine</u>
<u n="143" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="144" who="S0208">it's just the stress of if that doesn't happen cos I know that my dad will always be there to help me but he's not in a position where he physically can</u>
<u n="145" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="146" who="S0208">and I know that he would but I don't wanna put my parents in that position where they have to live off less because I don't have enough money</u>
<u n="147" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="148" who="S0208">that's not fair I don't wanna do that</u>
<u n="149" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0208">but if worse comes to worse I'll just get myself a part time job</u>
<u n="151" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="152" who="S0208" trans="overlap">and I'll live off that <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="153" who="S0202">you're getting the full whack from student finance this year aren't you?</u>
<u n="154" who="S0208">yep <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="155" who="S0202">it's just under eight grand <pause dur="short"/> half of that'll pay your rent</u>
<u n="156" who="S0208">I'm only getting twenty quid more than I did last year though</u>
<u n="157" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="158" who="S0208">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos I was practically at the maximum <pause dur="short"/> last year but it is only twenty quid difference this year</u>
<u n="159" who="S0202">it's inflation though it's gone up a little bit</u>
<u n="160" who="S0208">so</u>
<u n="161" who="S0202">have you looked at <pause dur="short"/> have you looked at how much you're actually getting like? have you got the?</u>
<u n="162" who="S0208">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0208">seven thousand eight hundred and something</u>
<u n="165" who="S0202">yeah nearly eight grand</u>
<u n="166" who="S0208">yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0202">but rent's cheaper this year by about four or five hundred quid</u>
<u n="168" who="S0208">yeah exactly so the money that I <pause dur="short"/> am saving from the cost of rent is going towards a</u>
<u n="169" who="S0202" trans="overlap">living</u>
<u n="170" who="S0208">bus pass</u>
<u n="171" who="S0202">bus pass yeah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0208">erm just really really need this French money so I need to ring and check that it's all alright but I have <trunc>g</trunc> I've got my savings from my grandad if worst comes to worse but if I am getting the French money then I'm not gonna touch that</u>
<u n="173" who="S0202">yeah you don't want to yeah</u>
<u n="174" who="S0208" trans="overlap">cos you know I might need it in the third year I might need it towards getting a placement or something</u>
<u n="175" who="S0202">mm <pause dur="short"/> thing is if you get a <pause dur="short"/> if you do a placement year you get paid for it anyway normally if you get a <pause dur="short"/> industry place</u>
<u n="176" who="S0208">yeah rather than a voluntary work yeah</u>
<u n="177" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0208">so hopefully</u>
<u n="179" who="S0202" trans="overlap">and you do get paid for it</u>
<u n="180" who="S0208" trans="overlap">it'll all be alright</u>
<u n="181" who="S0202">you normally get about fifteen grand to twenty grand a year <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="182" who="S0208">yeah but I'm thinking about just doing three months</u>
<u n="183" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0208">erm <pause dur="short"/> cos yeah I don't really wanna be abroad for that long</u>
<u n="185" who="S0202">well you don't have to be abroad to do a</u>
<u n="186" who="S0208">no I know but</u>
<u n="187" who="S0202" trans="overlap">placement</u>
<u n="188" who="S0208" trans="overlap">I don't wanna do it in England</u>
<u n="189" who="S0202">right okay</u>
<u n="190" who="S0208">I want to put it well I want to take advantage sort of being able to go abroad without having to worry about every single part of financing</u>
<u n="191" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="192" who="S0208">so hoping <pause dur="short"/> it will all sort itself out and once I've got it down on paper as well</u>
<u n="193" who="S0202">mm</u>
<u n="194" who="S0208">figure it out <pause dur="short"/> but I <trunc>ha</trunc></u>
