<u n="55" who="S0427" trans="overlap">I don't know how far afield he works and he works more than I mean I  it took me something like five months to get him because he was booked up</u>
<u n="56" who="S0426">ah yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0427">well so much so that I'm gonna have him back in about year's time to do my kitchen</u>

<u n="59" who="S0427">yeah he's even told me how to get it done cheaply <pause dur="short"/> like going to <unclear/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0426" trans="overlap">well kitchens are necessarily going to be more expensive because of all the appliances all the gas and so on and so on</u>
<u n="61" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah exactly yeah so <pause dur="short"/> but he does it all</u>
<u n="62" who="S0426">good for him</u>
<u n="63" who="S0427">and he's he's a carpenter basically and he does and he well he does kitchens and bathrooms <pause dur="short"/> but anyway you're you're more than welcome to come around and</u>
<u n="64" who="S0426" trans="overlap">that's very good but why did he have to change your bath? baths are usually pretty</u>
<u n="65" who="S0427" trans="overlap">well you see again it just annoyed me</u>
<u n="66" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="67" who="S0427">because it's it's as old as the house now I've been there since two thousand and the house was about seven years old then so</u>
<u n="68" who="S0426" trans="overlap">mm mm was it a plastic one rather than a metal or ceramic one?</u>
<u n="69" who="S0427">well erm the bath was plastic</u>
<u n="70" who="S0426" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="71" who="S0427">anyway but the thing was it was it was like a light blue colour and the one downstairs was like a a sort of a pale yellowy colour well I'd just put white in there</u>
<u n="72" who="S0426" trans="overlap">okay <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="73" who="S0427">erm and my brother bless him did the tiling upstairs in the guest bathroom</u>
<u n="74" who="S0426">that's very good of him</u>
<u n="75" who="S0427">but unfortunately neither he nor I knew that you can't put ceramic tiles onto a wooden floor unless you</u>
<u n="76" who="S0426">ah have a a some</u>
<u n="77" who="S0427">cos what happens is all all the gunge between the tiles starts to crack</u>
<u n="78" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah yes yes yes yes</u>
<u n="79" who="S0427">it looked okay but you know to my eye</u>
<u n="80" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> true</u>
<u n="81" who="S0427">but to anyone else it's like <unclear/> to my eyes though <unclear/></u>
<u n="82" who="S0426" trans="overlap">mm but it's just not flat enough if it's a wooden floor</u>
<u n="83" who="S0427">no that's right so erm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0426">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0427">I was very pleased with what he's done</u>
<u n="86" who="S0426">mm</u>
<u n="87" who="S0427">erm yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0426">well I mean tradespeople like that you grab onto them because you otherwise it's <unclear/> you don't know</u>
<u n="89" who="S0427" trans="overlap">well as I said he he worked for next door</u>
<u n="90" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0427">and he worked with my neighbours next door in their original house and when they moved into this one they <trunc>wan</trunc> they had him back</u>
<u n="92" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0427">and they showed me what he'd done and I just thought well I'm not gonna go running around now getting</u>
<u n="94" who="S0426">exactly yes <pause dur="short"/> that's <unclear/></u>
<u n="95" who="S0427" trans="overlap">so I I grabbed hold of him sometime in May or June and we agreed that we would do it in late September early October <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="96" who="S0426">I imagine he uses less upmarket materials because it can get very expensive furnishing bathrooms</u>
<u n="97" who="S0427" trans="overlap">oh I could of spent four thousand pounds on the bath</u>
<u n="98" who="S0426">yes yes <unclear/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0427" trans="overlap">and the taps and goodness knows whatever else in fact I didn't choose them I just said <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> just go and get me something functional and basic</u>
<u n="100" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0427">but he's got me mixer taps everywhere</u>
<u n="102" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0427">and I've got cut off valves whereas before</u>
<u n="104" who="S0426" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0427">I'd have to turn one off from the main thing but now I've got cut off valves on everything toilet bath because they weren't there you see as standard <unclear/></u>
<u n="106" who="S0426" trans="overlap">is your bath as it was <unclear/> low so you can see and get underneath it?</u>
<u n="107" who="S0427">no it's got a it's got a slide it's got a</u>
<u n="108" who="S0426">you can take it off easy?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0427">you can take that off easily it's just a couple of screws</u>
<u n="110" who="S0426">right well that's already an improvement on <vocal desc="laugh"/> on mine where I started to see a leak or not a leak I started to see water damage</u>
<u n="111" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0426">at the base of the outside wall on the bathroom and I thought what the hell's going on? I just couldn't figure it out in my mind at all cos it was nowhere near the the shower end it was the</u>
<u n="113" who="S0427">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0426">if you like the the head end of the bath on the outside you know the corridor wall inside my inside the flat and I got it into my head that it was leaking from the bottom of the bath</u>
<u n="115" who="S0427">right</u>
<u n="116" who="S0426">don't know how it could possibly do that there and I thought well I'll just take off the side panel of the bath</u>
<u n="117" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0426">but the side panel was a mirror or is a mirror</u>
<u n="119" who="S0427">oh right</u>
<u n="120" who="S0426" trans="overlap">and behind the mirror there was a <pause dur="short"/> thin wooden sheet which was put on some extremely tight fitting <unclear>way</unclear> so I had to smash in some er some end of it and to pull it all out I looked underneath the bath and it was completely dry</u>
<u n="121" who="S0427">that is strange</u>
<u n="122" who="S0426">very strange just <unclear/></u>
<u n="123" who="S0427" trans="overlap">so you didn't find out why this</u>
<u n="124" who="S0426">no I called a plumber in and he scratched his head and he said well in fact it's nothing to do with the under side of the bath the problem is in the taps the head of the bath</u>
<u n="125" who="S0427">mm</u>
<u n="126" who="S0426">and the water is somehow finding its way all along the rim of the bath and going down and staining the bottom of the <unclear/> so</u>
<u n="127" who="S0427">oh right</u>
<u n="128" who="S0426">he had to put the er yeah he fixed it easily enough he just changed the <pause dur="short"/> the er taps and the heads of the taps</u>
<u n="129" who="S0427">yeah right</u>
<u n="130" who="S0426">and then put the erm the wooden bit back on I I asked him kindly if he would put the mirror back on and he demurred and he said well we don't really touch mirrors and I said well look you know</u>
<u n="131" who="S0427">mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0426">give me a hand and we'll be alright so he very kindly did put it</u>
<u n="133" who="S0427" trans="overlap">right okay</u>
<u n="134" who="S0426">against the er the side of the bath</u>
<u n="135" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0426">but then it was left to me to</u>
<u n="137" who="S0427">to to screw that on</u>
<u n="138" who="S0426" trans="overlap">to then screw it on but screwing glass</u>
<u n="139" who="S0427">mm that can shatter</u>
<u n="140" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0427">well er with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> erm when he came he said to me he says my brother and his mate put the electric shower in and they ran the cold water off the electric shower by a series of pipes coming off the cold water feed but it looked neat but they they're exposed</u>
<u n="142" who="S0426">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0427">so it is like the Pompidou Centre or <unclear/></u>
<u n="144" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/> right</u>
<u n="145" who="S0427">and erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> just said er see I I if you wanted me to put in an electric shower I would bring in an electrician to check it</u>
<u n="146" who="S0426">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0427">but since it's in there I can do all of this do you want me to hide it all? and so it's got dug into the wall and then he put the tiles</u>
<u n="148" who="S0426" trans="overlap">much better</u>
<u n="149" who="S0427">over it</u>
<u n="150" who="S0426">much better</u>
<u n="151" who="S0427">it isn't a problem he he he does</u>
<u n="152" who="S0426" trans="overlap">sure</u>
<u n="153" who="S0427">all the electrics and all the rest of it erm and then at one point I said to him oh that lamp you know it's one of those awful sort of lamps and <unclear/> think oh <unclear/> with something more modern and he said go go to B and Q you know I will put it in for you you know</u>
<u n="154" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="155" who="S0427">erm I could of done it myself but erm you know why bother when you have got someone who really knows his stuff</u>
<u n="156" who="S0426" trans="overlap">no no absolutely not</u>
<u n="157" who="S0427">so he's changed two lights for me he has done electrical work <pause dur="short"/> the gate he bought for the thing erm <pause dur="short"/> it is a bit of a squeeze you know</u>
<u n="158" who="S0426">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0427">whereas he gets his plane out and</u>
<u n="160" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes yes yes yes yes</u>
<u n="161" who="S0427"><unclear>makes this</unclear> wonderful thing you know and he's just a little bit more just a little bit more</u>
<u n="162" who="S0426" trans="overlap">that's right that's right</u>
<u n="163" who="S0427">and he even told me about the best way to put the preservative on it he said half and half he said turpentine</u>
<u n="164" who="S0426">mm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0427">and you know <unclear>prop</unclear> things and let it soak into it cos you see so many gates <pause dur="short"/> covered in this beautiful brown thing and it starts to peel you know</u>
<u n="166" who="S0426" trans="overlap">right <pause dur="short"/> yes <pause dur="short"/> yes yes <pause dur="short"/> right nothing behind it</u>
<u n="167" who="S0427"><unclear/> hasn't been able to sink in whatever well if you think</u>
<u n="168" who="S0426" trans="overlap">right right right okay</u>
<u n="169" who="S0427">bloody hell I didn't know about that you know?</u>
<u n="170" who="S0426" trans="overlap">I know I know</u>
<u n="171" who="S0427">so that's what I did over the weekend you know a sort of a a wash and then <unclear/></u>
<u n="172" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> it's the kind of thing which lay people could do <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="173" who="S0427">yes exactly yeah yeah</u>
<u n="174" who="S0426" trans="overlap">they get the brush out and dab some stuff all over a piece of wood we can do that we can't plane</u>
<u n="175" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah that's right yeah we could do that</u>
<u n="176" who="S0426">at least I could not plane</u>
<u n="177" who="S0427">well I don't know I don't even have a plane so</u>
<u n="178" who="S0426" trans="overlap">probably <unclear>haven't got one</unclear> exactly and planing is probably much more subtle and difficult than it might be</u>
<u n="179" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah exactly so erm and he was saying the tiles you know suddenly he said <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> can you come up? and he said do you know it looks like it's ninety degree angles but it's not</u>
<u n="180" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="181" who="S0427">so you know I think it is better if we start here and when you come in the eye will see everything geometric and we can hide the <trunc>lit</trunc> the fact that</u>
<u n="182" who="S0426" trans="overlap">square yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes yes yes</u>
<u n="183" who="S0427">it won't be going like that it'll be going like this down there yeah that's fine you know?</u>
<u n="184" who="S0426">yeah right again people like us will just start from the bottom</u>
<u n="185" who="S0427">yeah that's right</u>
<u n="186" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/> work upwards and discover that it's completely skew whiff at the top</u>
<u n="187" who="S0427">and the other thing too of course is he completely tiles the whole floor and then the stand for the wash basin and the actual toilet itself</u>
<u n="188" who="S0426">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0427">sits on it he does not have to cut around it you see</u>
<u n="190" who="S0426">oh right</u>
<u n="191" who="S0427">it sits on the tiles and then you get that clear view sealant all the way round the bottom of it</u>
<u n="192" who="S0426">right because of course the pipes don't go through the tiles the pipes go through the wall <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="193" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah at the back yeah</u>
<u n="194" who="S0426">okay yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="195" who="S0427">they're at the back so I mean the the where the affront goes out he has had to cut round that</u>
<u n="196" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes that is right</u>
<u n="197" who="S0427">but that's largely hidden by the toilet anyway</u>

<u n="437" who="S0426">well talking of differential equations there was a story in the Guardian yesterday</u>
<u n="438" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="439" who="S0426">er an obituary about a <trunc>ma</trunc> a mathematician</u>
<u n="440" who="S0427">mm</u>
<u n="441" who="S0426">who'd written the text books on calculus</u>
<u n="442" who="S0427">oh</u>
<u n="443" who="S0426">and you think well sell a few thousand I suppose he sold five hundred thousand a year</u>
<u n="444" who="S0427">good god all round the world I take it?</u>
<u n="445" who="S0426">all round the world and he was a multi millionaire</u>
<u n="446" who="S0427">oh my you wouldn't think so would you? calculus like that you just wouldn't think so</u>
<u n="447" who="S0426" trans="overlap">if you write it both for universities and for schools two different versions and it's you know the the best one there is</u>
<u n="448" who="S0427">see there was a book on A level economics that was like too but I can't think of the name of it now</u>
