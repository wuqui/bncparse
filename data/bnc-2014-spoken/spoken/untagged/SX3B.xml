<u n="119" who="S0467">yeah probably just try and forget that it's there</u>
<u n="120" who="S0468">that's true or talk about the fact that it's there</u>
<u n="121" who="S0467">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0468">as a</u>
<u n="123" who="S0467" trans="overlap">talk about how erm being recorded might change the way that you speak in yourself like</u>
<u n="124" who="S0468" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0467">whether whether they should really be recording us in secret and but</u>
<u n="126" who="S0468" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="127" who="S0467">obviously they can't really do that cos we've gotta sign a consent form</u>
<u n="128" who="S0468">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0467">unless you just follow round someone round with a tape recorder and then</u>
<u n="130" who="S0468">could you do that would there be ethical implications to just going round recording conversations outside cafes</u>
<u n="131" who="S0467" trans="overlap">amend it yeah and then erm get get permission retrospectively</u>
<u n="132" who="S0468">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah could be done couldn't it? I mean if someone didn't wanna be recorded and you could just say we'll destroy it because it does change the dynamic</u>
<u n="133" who="S0467">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0468">it's the same with the video interview that I had</u>
<u n="135" who="S0467" trans="overlap">you'll think yeah you'll think about I've I've just thought there what ah but they're gonna note down that I've just overlapped you in speech there and that might come across as quite a erm dominating thing</u>
<u n="136" who="S0468"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="137" who="S0467">but really like we're so relaxed around each other</u>
<u n="138" who="S0468" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0467">it doesn't really matter</u>
<u n="140" who="S0468">there's no set pattern of speech here it's probably er I dunno <unclear/> slightly different different way of interacting</u>
<u n="141" who="S0467">yeah I imagine the way that we're talking is gonna be quite different to how everyone else is gonna be talking so</u>
<u n="142" who="S0468">mm quite possibly</u>
<u n="143" who="S0467">although we haven't said cunt yet</u>
<u n="144" who="S0468"><vocal desc="laugh"/> there you go</u>
<u n="145" who="S0467">yeah</u>

<u n="150" who="S0468"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="151" who="S0467">reclaiming it as a term of endearment</u>
<u n="152" who="S0468"><vocal desc="laugh"/> this should be quite an interesting I wouldn't mind transcribing people's random conversations it gives you quite a unique insight into people doesn't it? <unclear/> chatting here like there's someone sitting near it it's that idea of transcendence</u>
<u n="153" who="S0467">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0468">separate the third the third person you're aware of yourself in the third person now I'm not I'm not just talking which is the facticity of what I'm doing</u>
<u n="155" who="S0467" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0468">it's the <trunc>tran</trunc>transcendent idea that someone someone's <trunc>watc</trunc> that's watching it when you</u>
<u n="157" who="S0467" trans="overlap">it's the idea of <unclear>the</unclear> self as well because obviously we've got a certain er interpretation of how how we're talking</u>
<u n="158" who="S0468">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0467">but then someone else listening to this isn't isn't gonna have all of the background of our like friendship and</u>
<u n="160" who="S0468" trans="overlap">sure</u>
<u n="161" who="S0467">and like <vocal desc="laugh"/> all the different like shit that we talk about</u>
<u n="162" who="S0468" trans="overlap"><unclear>Argo</unclear></u>
<u n="163" who="S0467">on a daily basis <vocal desc="laugh"/> and then come and sit here</u>
<u n="164" who="S0468">yeah</u>
<u n="165" who="S0467">and just <trunc>sor</trunc> and have a little excerpt of it</u>
<u n="166" who="S0468">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="167" who="S0467" trans="overlap">in isolation</u>
<u n="168" who="S0468">it's like the cork floating on the water</u>
<u n="169" who="S0467" trans="overlap">you've got well got my you've got my name you've my age you've got the you've got erm that I'm British that I speak British English</u>
<u n="170" who="S0468"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="171" who="S0467">as though this kind of these are the most important characteristics that are gonna determine my of the way that I speak</u>
<u n="172" who="S0468">yeah</u>
<u n="173" who="S0467">when in reality there's a lot of different factors</u>
<u n="174" who="S0468">yeah</u>
<u n="175" who="S0467">they don't know that my they don't know that my</u>
<u n="176" who="S0468" trans="overlap">it's gonna be who you're with</u>
<u n="177" who="S0467">parents are working class and <unclear>have</unclear> gone to university and you know dad's from <anon type="place"/> and my mum's from Ireland and</u>

<u n="179" who="S0467">they don't <unclear/> get that from <unclear>anything will</unclear> they?</u>
<u n="180" who="S0468">yeah no it's true you think there it'd be worth getting better insight or <pause dur="short"/> but then I dunno yeah cos a lot of languages depend on who you're sitting down and chatting to isn't it?</u>
<u n="181" who="S0467">yeah</u>
<u n="182" who="S0468">surely? the the context entirely I suppose they'll be including that in their analysis somehow</u>
<u n="183" who="S0467">well it's whether it's relevant as well</u>
<u n="184" who="S0468">mm</u>
<u n="185" who="S0467">it's not really relevant to <unclear/> much is it? or the the topics</u>
<u n="186" who="S0468" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="187" who="S0467">that we're talking about it's more</u>
<u n="188" who="S0468">mm <pause dur="short"/> but then if you could build in kind of friends within a within a class and got them to talk more effectively about certain subjects maybe the <unclear/> outcomes would be better there</u>
<u n="189" who="S0467">mm</u>
<u n="190" who="S0468">who knows</u>
<u n="191" who="S0467">speech wouldn't be as natural</u>
<u n="192" who="S0468"><unclear>well</unclear></u>
<u n="193" who="S0467" trans="overlap">although this isn't natural either <unclear>I guess</unclear></u>
