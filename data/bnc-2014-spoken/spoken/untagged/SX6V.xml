<u n="1" who="S0427">well I <trunc>d</trunc> I didn't bring all of them just just a selection</u>
<u n="2" who="S0426">how many have you got?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0427">mm well I I had something like seventy printed out and not expensive I've got a few</u>
<u n="4" who="S0426">selected from how many photos? <vocal desc="laugh"/> four hundred</u>
<u n="5" who="S0427" trans="overlap">oh god <pause dur="short"/> well I I would say probably five hundred on two cameras yeah</u>
<u n="6" who="S0426">before you show it was that the case last year that something happened to</u>
<u n="7" who="S0427">yeah I yeah it started erm to leaking it started to leaking erm and I I lost a few but but my brother it turns out had taken six hundred photographs on one camera so</u>
<u n="8" who="S0426" trans="overlap"><unclear/> shit <pause dur="short"/> it's not the same as your own photographs though of your holiday but</u>
<u n="9" who="S0427">no I mean</u>
<u n="10" who="S0426">at least least he got some</u>
<u n="11" who="S0427">no I I I still have a fair number on one camera</u>
<u n="12" who="S0426">right</u>
<u n="13" who="S0427">erm but but not on the other one <unclear/></u>
<u n="14" who="S0426">right</u>
<u n="15" who="S0427">so this is this is in the Matobo Hills which is a world heritage site largely it's a combination of the the this basalt gold granite rock I should say granite rock and the culture and the languages and all the rest of it but it's a world heritage site and in fact where we were staying is built around cases like this</u>
<u n="16" who="S0426">in fact probably built off that kind of rock</u>
<u n="17" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah and in fact sometimes that will be the wall the side wall the back wall and these are the kinds of places we stayed in</u>
<u n="18" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="19" who="S0427">so this lodge</u>
<u n="20" who="S0426">wow</u>
<u n="21" who="S0427">this lodge or chalet is on one of those</u>
<u n="22" who="S0426">oh</u>
<u n="23" who="S0427">but you're sitting out point is across this bridge that's a bridge with the you know the wood and the ropes and the <unclear/></u>
<u n="24" who="S0426" trans="overlap">is it as wobbly as it looks?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0427">it is yeah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0426">ah</u>
<u n="27" who="S0427">if you'd had a drop to drink the fall is just about enough to er</u>
<u n="28" who="S0426" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="29" who="S0427">severely injure you</u>
<u n="30" who="S0426"><trunc>i</trunc>it's not impossible to fall between those</u>
<u n="31" who="S0427">no</u>
<u n="32" who="S0426">er struts is it?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0427">it it <trunc>i</trunc> the thing is if the two of you go across the first one sets up an oscillation and because my brother went across in front of me and that's what threw me but anyway that's a typical there's only eight places and this is one of them and of course a lot of them our washbasin for instance was made out of carved granite</u>
<u n="34" who="S0426">oh</u>
<u n="35" who="S0427">and that was quite <pause dur="short"/> and this is the Matobo Hills national park</u>
<u n="36" who="S0426">is that <trunc>w</trunc> the one where you approached very gingerly the white rhino</u>
<u n="37" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah yeah and this is er rhino one one four</u>
<u n="38" who="S0426">oh right</u>
<u n="39" who="S0427">erm apparently when we saw <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> afterwards he identified it to the rangers and they said oh that will be one one four and so he's a bit white rhino er about fifty yards away</u>
<u n="40" who="S0426">fifty yards away so you</u>
<u n="41" who="S0427">about fifty yards</u>
<u n="42" who="S0426">a little bit</u>
<u n="43" who="S0427">yeah but erm all he did was keep twitching his ears and grunting and occasionally he'd turn away but he he he wasn't too bothered he hung around for about eight minutes or so before he decided to go</u>
<u n="44" who="S0426">what a beast</u>
<u n="45" who="S0427">yeah and then we saw a little pride of lions they had cubs but the cubs were hidden so we couldn't see them we did briefly see the the the <trunc>c</trunc> the male lion I don't think I've got a photograph of him there were two females and something different then and you can see in the dry season how difficult it would be to spot these because their coat is almost exactly the same</u>
<u n="46" who="S0426">just go back for a moment how far away were you from from that?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0427">we were in a vehicle but we were only about ten yards away</u>
<u n="48" who="S0426">she wasn't perturbed by that</u>
<u n="49" who="S0427">well they did get out and wander off into thick bush after a while I think they got a bit miffed with us trying to manoeuvre the vehicle to get a better shot and that's what I was thinking</u>
<u n="50" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="51" who="S0427">and er they just think oh we've had enough of this and they wander off you know but they they not didn't run off</u>
<u n="52" who="S0426">no no</u>
<u n="53" who="S0427">they didn't growl or anything it was just a case of oh let's get some peace and quiet</u>
<u n="54" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="55" who="S0427">just happened to catch him in the er at the long at the dusting himself in the in the</u>
<u n="56" who="S0426" trans="overlap">that's a great shot</u>
<u n="57" who="S0427">in the stuff you know</u>
<u n="58" who="S0426">wow wow</u>
<u n="59" who="S0427" trans="overlap">this is this is the secretary bird</u>
<u n="60" who="S0426">I don't think we've seen birds much in <unclear/></u>
<u n="61" who="S0427">no this is a secretary bird apparently named around about the early nineteen hundreds because a lot of secretaries in New York city used to dress in black stockings black erm dress and white top</u>
<u n="62" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="63" who="S0427">and this was and when when they came to work they'd have a hat with feathers in it</u>
<u n="64" who="S0426">ah ha ha okay</u>
<u n="65" who="S0427">bird was similar</u>
<u n="66" who="S0426">good enough story but okay fine</u>
<u n="67" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah yeah and they they caught snakes so all the locals love them</u>
<u n="68" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0427">and that's the typical scene where I have a glass of white wine in my hand having finished a Sunday drive</u>
<u n="70" who="S0426">yes that's good</u>
<u n="71" who="S0427">erm and these these are camel thorn trees here and that's the kind of sunsets you get you know it's a it's a tough old life I can assure you</u>
<u n="72" who="S0426">it is a glass of wine rather than a G and T?</u>
<u n="73" who="S0427">oh they some people had G and Ts but I I I stick to my er chilled white wine</u>
<u n="74" who="S0426" trans="overlap">was it local wine I mean how local was it?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0427">it's South African</u>
<u n="76" who="S0426">South African I don't suppose you've always got <unclear>that</unclear> particular <unclear>might have</unclear></u>
<u n="77" who="S0427">it may have but we didn't come across it <pause dur="short"/> now these shots the next few were taken from our hide which is underground so</u>
<u n="78" who="S0426">oh this one's looking up</u>
<u n="79" who="S0427">this this</u>
<u n="80" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah that's</u>
<u n="81" who="S0427">the photograph's been taken from ground level</u>
<u n="82" who="S0426" trans="overlap">that's fantastic fantastic shot</u>
<u n="83" who="S0427">erm and the water is just by there and there is another water hole further down so you know that's the kind of impression</u>
<u n="84" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/> that's just amazing</u>
<u n="85" who="S0427">and he knows</u>
<u n="86" who="S0426">just amazing</u>
<u n="87" who="S0427">he knows we're there but he's not bothered you know because he can't see our silhouette we're not using flash we're not making noise</u>
<u n="88" who="S0426">are their eyes forward looking or are they on the side of the head?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0427">they are mostly forward looking yeah they have very poor eyesight but they would see you from that distance and and that's him again with the water coming out and this was another little family that came up but it's because this is where the freshest water is it comes out here and it bubbles through a little gully down to a <trunc>m</trunc> a water hole but there the water the water is all muddy and mushed up because they they do everything in it</u>
<u n="90" who="S0426" trans="overlap">right <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0427">but here it's absolutely <trunc>f</trunc> in fact <trunc>y</trunc>you and I could drink out of it it's come up through</u>
<u n="92" who="S0426">through so much self-filtering</u>
<u n="93" who="S0427" trans="overlap">seventy-seventy metres of Kalahari sand apparently these are the night owl <unclear/></u>
<u n="94" who="S0426">oh aren't they sweet</u>
<u n="95" who="S0427">at <anon type="place"/> primary school which is in Hwange national park and this is as we've arrived they're singing and dancing for us and then they took us into the classrooms and showed us their workbooks and erm charming</u>
<u n="96" who="S0426" trans="overlap">one thing they themselves have to buy their uniforms</u>
<u n="97" who="S0427"><trunc>n</trunc> I think so and their <trunc>p</trunc> for for this it's thirty dollars a term to pay so it's ninety dollars a year</u>
<u n="98" who="S0426" trans="overlap"><unclear/> and for what?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0427">and that that means that there are some children who don't come to school</u>
<u n="100" who="S0426">sure</u>
<u n="101" who="S0427">and secondary school is a hundred dollars but but the participation rates are getting a lot better this is us on an all-day game drive where we've stopped for lunch that's that's my brother there by the way erm and this is an American couple and this is <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the guide and his assistant has has taken</u>
<u n="102" who="S0426">taken the photograph</u>
<u n="103" who="S0427">and so this is lunch erm and they will see the table with help yourself food and this is what we're looking at and we sat there for an hour and a half</u>
<u n="104" who="S0426" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> put those together that's just a wonderful comparison isn't it</u>
<u n="105" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah yeah and we just had herd after herd of elephants</u>
<u n="106" who="S0426">you just sat there and they paraded in front of you</u>
<u n="107" who="S0427" trans="overlap">just watched yes and in fact we walked down to this area as well and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he was saying don't go any further because there's crocodiles and there's hippos</u>
<u n="108" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="109" who="S0427">or if the <trunc>l</trunc> if the elephants were coming around this side he said we'll now come back now but when they were on the other side we could go down a bit and in fact one of the crocodiles did surprise the group of elephants erm and and made it made it startle and move away the reason being erm that the elephants have to be careful we actually saw an elephant that was perfectly healthy but it had lost the bottom eight nine ten inches of its trunk</u>
<u n="110" who="S0426" trans="overlap">trunk</u>
<u n="111" who="S0427">and it had to adapt but it it was with the herd it was well fed and all the rest of it it was fine and that was a cheetah who the hell spotted that I I don't know how the guy behind should say he spotted that it looks easy now but we were a fair distance away when he spotted it and he must have eyes attuned to</u>
<u n="112" who="S0426">just remind me of the difference between a cheetah and a leopard?</u>
<u n="113" who="S0427">yeah the cheetah is much lighter erm built for speed erm wouldn't harm or really wouldn't even think of harming a human being in normal circumstances</u>
<u n="114" who="S0426" trans="overlap">ah uhu uhu</u>
<u n="115" who="S0427">a leopard will mostly run away from you but it could harm you if it wanted to and it's</u>
<u n="116" who="S0426">again when there's er when there's young</u>
<u n="117" who="S0427">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0426">at risk</u>
<u n="119" who="S0427">and leopards are stealth erm hunters they get up close</u>
<u n="120" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0427">these are obviously no but</u>
<u n="122" who="S0426">ah yes</u>
<u n="123" who="S0427">we had a Sunday on our motorbikes and then these were</u>
<u n="124" who="S0426"><unclear>these</unclear> look young that way</u>
<u n="125" who="S0427">er <trunc>n</trunc>not they're well they're they they look quite young in the sense that they are probably twenty twenty-five year old but we can't see we can't see the matriarch but <trunc>the</trunc>these are of childbearing age so to speak</u>
<u n="126" who="S0426" trans="overlap">okay okay right</u>
<u n="127" who="S0427">they're quite small in in some ways but one of one of these has a little baby round here and this is us round the campfire <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> I just want to point out the wine</u>
<u n="128" who="S0426" trans="overlap">ah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="129" who="S0427">thing with with ice in it and er the bottles of chilled white are are in there</u>
<u n="130" who="S0426">how much of your own labour went into the appropriation of any of this? none presumably</u>
<u n="131" who="S0427">well I did I did pick up a a piece of wood</u>
<u n="132" who="S0426">and throw it</u>
<u n="133" who="S0427">and throw it in the fire</u>
<u n="134" who="S0426">that's very good</u>
<u n="135" who="S0427">and and and I did order the wine erm and like there is my glass and I I did pick it up and drink it</u>
<u n="136" who="S0426" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> you did you held it yourself</u>
<u n="137" who="S0427">yes and I did take part in the conversations and there is the water hole from the water hole just down there so you know there was some now these are the elephants that drink out the</u>
<u n="138" who="S0426" trans="overlap">ah the one that's in the perimeter yes yes yes</u>
<u n="139" who="S0427" trans="overlap">so there is the water hole most of the elephants are down here but a few come up and I am stood on this deck on on the deck so I'm not far away</u>
<u n="140" who="S0426">no no you couldn't be any closer</u>
<u n="141" who="S0427">and you know</u>
<u n="142" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0427">tricks and some what</u>
<u n="144" who="S0426">that's a great photograph</u>
<u n="145" who="S0427" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> just a superb photograph and it's the delicacy and you know when the first one came up it put its trunk in and it went like that to knock the dust off the top of the water</u>
<u n="146" who="S0426">oh</u>
<u n="147" who="S0427">then it expelled the water first of all and then it drank</u>
<u n="148" who="S0426" trans="overlap">right okay</u>
<u n="149" who="S0427">so it's really quite delicate now this is how close you can get to an elephant this is in a vehicle that is my brother taking a photograph of an elephant</u>
<u n="150" who="S0426">uh huh that's a nice shot I like it</u>
<u n="151" who="S0427">you could you could almost touch it when that elephant was putting its trunk out to smell us if you'd been stupid you could have touched the trunk</u>
<u n="152" who="S0426">that would have been stupid yes</u>
<u n="153" who="S0427">and they're drinking from this</u>
<u n="154" who="S0426">tiny</u>
<u n="155" who="S0427">they made this this is where they've there's a pipe underneath here running along this track taking water from a borehole to a a lodge somewhere and they can smell it even though it's underwater in a plastic pipe it's about a metre down they dug down punctured it and this is what they've got and this is fresh water to drink and they just weren't bothered they weren't bothered at all that we were there look you can see all the little ones their mothers are not bothered so they're not bothered</u>
<u n="156" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="long"/> by did to just the familiarity with the vehicle</u>
<u n="157" who="S0427">this this particular one in fact <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> said that he had <trunc>ca</trunc> I don't know whether it was this one or this one when we when we drove up I thought how much closer is he going to get and he stopped literally inches away from the nearest elephant and he said she probably won't do it because it's not cold enough but in the winter when I stop close to her she comes up and puts her trunk on the bonnet of my car to warm it up that's how relaxed this herd is but he knows that and this is then moving away from the waterhole</u>
<u n="158" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes yes <pause dur="short"/> that gives that gives a much better sense of the the environment</u>
<u n="159" who="S0427">yes it does is more this is more natural in a way than this kind of thing and the pool</u>
<u n="160" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yes yes that's right but okay</u>
<u n="161" who="S0427">you know and there's a there's a grand they they they amble away they are like this when you see them going you know</u>
<u n="162" who="S0426">what sort of temperature when you look at that what's it like? what's it feel like to be in that environment?</u>
<u n="163" who="S0427" trans="overlap">this er this this is very dry environment there is a not a lot humidity erm this is about thirty degrees erm</u>
<u n="164" who="S0426">hot</u>
<u n="165" who="S0427">centigrade</u>
<u n="166" who="S0426">hot</u>
<u n="167" who="S0427">yeah it is it is quite hot erm between twelve and three o'clock it's erm it's hard work going anywhere and and this is erm Victoria Falls erm and you can walk you start at this end this is the start and you walk along this gorge here the drop for about a kilometre and a half and there is the classic er</u>
<u n="168" who="S0426" trans="overlap">mm yeah the classic rainbow</u>
<u n="169" who="S0427">rainbow thing</u>
<u n="170" who="S0426">that is spectacular there's no doubt about it that's just spectacular</u>
<u n="171" who="S0427">yeah and of course this is the low flow season so you don't get the huge noise and the huge spray though there is quite a lot of spray erm but you can take photographs because <trunc>y</trunc>you're not getting drenched</u>
<u n="172" who="S0426">otherwise you'd yes you'd be drenched</u>
<u n="173" who="S0427">and this guy is very close to the lip fishing for a living</u>
<u n="174" who="S0426" trans="overlap">oh christ god <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="175" who="S0427">erm I mean that's that's brave that is and that is the thing going over the edge</u>
<u n="176" who="S0426">ah that's good that's terrific</u>
<u n="177" who="S0427">yeah and that side is Zambia and you get the best views on this side from Zimbabwe</u>
<u n="178" who="S0426">oh that's even better that's a great photograph</u>
<u n="179" who="S0427">that's erm</u>
<u n="180" who="S0426">just just great</u>
<u n="181" who="S0427">but they they tell me that in peak flow the water would be coming over here as well</u>
<u n="182" who="S0426">wow</u>
<u n="183" who="S0427">and if the wind is coming you wouldn't want to take your camera out</u>
<u n="184" who="S0426">you'd get drenched</u>
<u n="185" who="S0427">because you'd probably probably get drenched yeah</u>
<u n="186" who="S0426">superb</u>
<u n="187" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="188" who="S0426">just superb</u>
<u n="189" who="S0427">I I I I enjoyed printing those off and well making the selections I should say</u>
<u n="190" who="S0426">you sent them away to be printed</u>
<u n="191" who="S0427">yes I use erm Snapfish and erm I I had about seventy of these ten by eights done and they only cost me er thirty quid</u>
<u n="192" who="S0426">definitely worth it</u>
<u n="193" who="S0427">yeah it's erm it it's er</u>
<u n="194" who="S0426">I mean when you see it on the screen it's it's more encompassing you can't really riffle through them in the same way</u>
<u n="195" who="S0427">no and in fact with some of the others erm you know <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s mother was quite aged now and she's not into computers and things like that and so I'll send a few photographs with a commentary up to her because she likes that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="196" who="S0426">yes yes that's nice yes that's right yes</u>
<u n="197" who="S0427">erm so I won't keep I'll probably keep these but there are there are another thirty odd that weren't quite as good as I thought they were going to be or they were duplicating this stuff</u>
<u n="198" who="S0426">yes that's right</u>
<u n="199" who="S0427">you know</u>
<u n="200" who="S0426">I think you're right to be as selective as you possibly can</u>
<u n="201" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="202" who="S0426">because that means each one has got its own you know impact without it being diluted by seeing similar</u>
<u n="203" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah yeah I I mean I think that's right I mean I had another three or four of the rocks but I thought well they're interesting to me but you've seen one rock formation you don't want to see another three or four you know</u>
<u n="204" who="S0426">and some of those if the resolution is good not probably the one that had like the rhino but could be mounted in some way</u>
<u n="205" who="S0427">yeah I mean in the past I've had real favourites put in a frame and I've kept <unclear/></u>
<u n="206" who="S0426" trans="overlap">you've got a couple in your room</u>
<u n="207" who="S0427">I have I've got a few in the room and I've got one or two in the house but but I have to stop myself though because you know I mean you could come to my house and then think <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s starting up a shop for Africana you know</u>
<u n="208" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="209" who="S0427">because I I mean I <trunc>di</trunc> I didn't buy a great deal</u>
<u n="210" who="S0426">no no</u>
<u n="211" who="S0427">in Zimbabwe</u>
<u n="212" who="S0426">right right</u>
<u n="213" who="S0427">but it was just as well because when I came back I thought oh I've got another carved</u>
<u n="214" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="215" who="S0427">it's a it's a teak bowl it's another one it's beautiful and it's teak it's fantastic hmm well I suppose if I took that one and put it upstairs out of the way I could put that you know I mean I am I am more or less full up</u>
<u n="216" who="S0426" trans="overlap">yeah yes yes up there well yes but these aren't like you see the nice object in a in John Lewis and you thought oh I like that's it's a very different kind of thing this is a genuine memento I suppose too</u>
<u n="217" who="S0427" trans="overlap">mm yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="218" who="S0426">just a nice object which you find in a shop in Britain it's a different kettle of fish entirely</u>
<u n="219" who="S0427">I I I bought a a I brought a bowl back for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="220" who="S0426">mm</u>
<u n="221" who="S0427">and erm so I gave her the bowl and she was really very pleased and then the next day I thought oh I never told her about it so I sent an email saying it was I'd bought it in the <anon type="place"/> village where Mr <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> had taken he's the head man he'd taken us around and introduced us to his wife <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and then we did this that and the other and then we ended up in this little market place and the woman there said it was made from redwood and they'd polish it</u>
<u n="222" who="S0426"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="223" who="S0427">and they get the colours from boot polish</u>
<u n="224" who="S0426">oh Christ</u>
<u n="225" who="S0427">which they rub in erm you know and and and that's what I brought and and she said oh <trunc>wha</trunc>what a back story this is wonderful</u>
<u n="226" who="S0426" trans="overlap">there's so much to <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="227" who="S0427">you know so it's I thought you know I suppose more than a bowl in some respect you know</u>
<u n="228" who="S0426">I mean compared to the back story well it was on the third shelf up in John Lewis you know when you walk past things</u>
<u n="229" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah yeah it is a bit different yeah</u>
<u n="230" who="S0426">like those big giraffes you see on the floor and erm ceramic tigers</u>
<u n="231" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah and in and in <pause dur="short"/> yeah and in and in and in John Lewis is probably nearer a hundred dollars or the equivalent rather than nearer what I paid for it</u>
<u n="232" who="S0426">that's right and although the original</u>
<u n="233" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="234" who="S0426">buyer wouldn't have paid as less as you paid for it so</u>
<u n="235" who="S0427">yeah no</u>
<u n="236" who="S0426">terrific really wonderful</u>
<u n="237" who="S0427" trans="overlap">but er yeah so erm did you see your er third year dissertation students and how many have you got?</u>
<u n="238" who="S0426">well there's lots of students <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <unclear>rest of our</unclear> staff so it had to be more this year than it would normally be so it's ten</u>
<u n="239" who="S0427">oh I've got eleven this year but that's</u>
<u n="240" who="S0426">again you're in the same position as we are</u>
<u n="241" who="S0427">yeah yeah yeah that's right erm I saw most of them one or two couldn't turn up so I'll <trunc>I</trunc>I'll see those on Monday so you know it's not too bad erm</u>
<u n="242" who="S0426">I think if you split them into two groups it's doable six and five</u>
<u n="243" who="S0427">yeah well I I'm going to see them individually after all this</u>
<u n="244" who="S0426">are you?</u>
<u n="245" who="S0427">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="246" who="S0426">that's a lot of work</u>
<u n="247" who="S0427">I I only see them well <trunc>I</trunc>I'm <trunc>I</trunc>I'm just used to it <trunc>I</trunc>I stack them up like planes at Heathrow if you see what I mean <trunc>be</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> say say I've got eleven when things start warming up there'll be five or six who are all finishing work in <trunc>w</trunc> in one week and I'll have you know someone two o'clock someone two thirty someone three o'clock someone three thirty-four o'clock four thirty and then I've done that group then you see and I'll have readied I'll have read their stuff the the the day before and er made comments on it and stuff like that</u>
<u n="248" who="S0426">but I'm seeing them every week</u>
<u n="249" who="S0427"><trunc>I</trunc>I'll probably see them every other week</u>
<u n="250" who="S0426">okay well that's more doable okay</u>
<u n="251" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah I in I could see them every week but I think it would only be if they came to me and said I'm <trunc>I</trunc>I'm writing this I want to ask your advice about it</u>
<u n="252" who="S0426">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="253" who="S0427">because normally the deadlines that we agree together they need more than one week in order to produce</u>
<u n="254" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="255" who="S0427">a particular piece of work</u>
<u n="256" who="S0426">right</u>
<u n="257" who="S0427">they meet weekly with <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and the others doing the dissertation module which is a different thing from the dissertation supervision</u>
<u n="258" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="259" who="S0427">but now I don't know whether your <unclear>soc sci</unclear> people do that erm but there is a dissertation module which <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and maybe <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> have something to do with and it's</u>
<u n="260" who="S0426" trans="overlap"><unclear>cell</unclear></u>
<u n="261" who="S0427">and it some of it is subject specific</u>
<u n="262" who="S0426">right</u>
<u n="263" who="S0427">and some of it is general so plagiarism would be general</u>
<u n="264" who="S0426" trans="overlap">okay yeah</u>
<u n="265" who="S0427">now the first meeting was today eleven till one</u>
<u n="266" who="S0426" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="267" who="S0427">so but the first meeting today was meet your supervisors so I happened to see mine in the morning and then cos I had to go to Sainsbury's at for elevenish so I couldn't see them then erm</u>
<u n="268" who="S0426">well that clarifies something which was a bit unclear in my mind because they my students were talking about this thing I thought I better not interfere</u>
<u n="269" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="270" who="S0426">so there is this thing with with putting as a department with representatives from each group</u>
<u n="271" who="S0427">well I <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>I</trunc><trunc>I</trunc>I don't know the full ins and outs of it erm if I <trunc>g</trunc> if I remember when I go back I'll might forward you the email er which which which might give you some idea about the structure erm but I know various people are contributing there is stuff on plagiarism and erm might be people from the library coming down to do stuff on</u>
<u n="272" who="S0426">it's sort of <unclear/> is that right?</u>
<u n="273" who="S0427">yeah well I suppose it yes in a way it is er but it would be subject specific erm no sorry erm but it would be dissertation specific and <trunc>I</trunc>I think when it comes to say quant methods there was one bit of the timetable I saw where it said erm discourse soc sci students and discourse analysis and then it was what would it be? erm content analysis CMS you know and I'm talking very very roughly now</u>
<u n="274" who="S0426" trans="overlap">dissertation specific <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="275" who="S0427">and I thought oh yeah well I could see how they'd split up into that</u>
<u n="276" who="S0426">right</u>
<u n="277" who="S0427">you know so if I if I can find that <trunc>e</trunc> I get so much as programme director I only keep stuff that I know</u>
<u n="278" who="S0426">yeah</u>
<u n="279" who="S0427">is going to be but if I find it I'll forward it to you so you get some idea of what is going on</u>
<u n="280" who="S0426">it sounds like a good idea in so far as</u>
<u n="281" who="S0427" trans="overlap">I think so yeah</u>
<u n="282" who="S0426">there will be commonalities in the</u>
<u n="283" who="S0427">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="284" who="S0426">so all confront like plagiarism for example and using the library and so on although many of our our our students probably yours as well have come across well Google search you know Google Scholar or</u>
<u n="285" who="S0427" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="286" who="S0426">but they haven't all come across web science and psych info in ours</u>
<u n="287" who="S0427" trans="overlap">well no no that's true</u>
<u n="288" who="S0426">and that can be something which they wouldn't otherwise know about unless somebody told them</u>
<u n="289" who="S0427">no <trunc>I</trunc><trunc>I</trunc>I think for the you know the more keen <trunc>an</trunc> or the better students that they'll get a lot more out of it my I may have got this wrong but my impression is there is a light touch to this because I know part of it is about dropping stuff and and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was saying she'll be available</u>
<u n="290" who="S0426">yes</u>
<u n="291" who="S0427">but you're not mandated to come so I mean the ten weeks it's not a it's not a heavy duty ticking the register kind of thing at least I <trunc>don</trunc> I didn't get that impression but er it's there you know for for people</u>
<u n="292" who="S0426">but you know our experiences when we have these drop things is that A most students don't turn up and B</u>
<u n="293" who="S0427">that's true</u>
<u n="294" who="S0426">the students don't go the ones who do go</u>
<u n="295" who="S0427">yeah</u>
<u n="296" who="S0426">if you <unclear/> at least because they're they know what their problem is and they could probably solve it by themselves</u>
<u n="297" who="S0427">it it</u>
<u n="298" who="S0426">the take up is usually something like twenty percent</u>
<u n="299" who="S0427">I think this might <trunc>I</trunc>I mean some of it is mandated as in you should go to this and and some of it might be a drop in clinic or clinic about X Y or Z and I think that looser function might have been because last year it was all mandatory and the people weren't turning up and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was there fiddling her fingers kind of thing</u>
<u n="300" who="S0426" trans="overlap">right right <pause dur="short"/> so she might as well turn it into a non-mandatory</u>
<u n="301" who="S0427">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="302" who="S0426">and then okay</u>
<u n="303" who="S0427">but I'm not absolutely sure I couldn't I mean it it in horror it came to me and I thought this is the first I have heard what I'm not doing this way and then I saw <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s name and I thought oh yeah it's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who does this so er so she's</u>
<u n="304" who="S0426" trans="overlap">well it's good of her though cos she's got plenty on her plate without that kind of stuff as well</u>
<u n="305" who="S0427">yeah but she seems you know quite keen to do it really to to to bring their skills on</u>
<u n="306" who="S0426" trans="overlap">right yeah that's what she's like she'll do oodles of work</u>
<u n="307" who="S0427">yeah yeah that's right</u>
<u n="308" who="S0426">anything happening about the chair advert?</u>
<u n="309" who="S0427">oh er yeah well I think it's erm I think the advert is out there now</u>
<u n="310" who="S0426">that's good</u>
<u n="311" who="S0427">and also the one to replace <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> with the lectureship</u>
<u n="312" who="S0426">excellent excellent</u>
<u n="313" who="S0427">erm they've both been advertised so we know dates for interviews and we've got the process what's happening now is that er various of my colleagues are trying to approach people individually</u>
<u n="314" who="S0426">good I think that's</u>
<u n="315" who="S0427">and say are you interested in applying and they are trying to get an assessor I mean I I I got in touch with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who would've been brilliant he's going to be external examiner for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> but he can't do it</u>
<u n="316" who="S0426">okay</u>
<u n="317" who="S0427">unfortunately but they'll <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> or someone like that might well do it you know</u>
<u n="318" who="S0426">what about your internal sorry your external examiner for for the programme</u>
<u n="319" who="S0427">er well that would have been an obvious choice I don't know whether that's allowed or not I don't know erm anyway that's passed that's passed out of my hands now to the likes of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who who know more about the field</u>
<u n="320" who="S0426">right</u>

<u n="333" who="S0427">yeah yeah</u>
