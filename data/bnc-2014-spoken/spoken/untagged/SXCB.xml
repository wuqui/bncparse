<u n="102" who="S0383">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0328">she didn't change it in any way but the main thing that she did wrong just cos it was like supposed to have been in January like twenty <trunc>s</trunc> twenty-ninth or she forwarded the email to herself to change it on twenty-sixth of February so she changed it to twenty-ninth but left it as February and so it was like twenty-ninth of February which actually doesn't exist</u>

<u n="110" who="S0326">physical warning</u>
<u n="111" who="S0328">not matter what physical warning <vocal desc="laugh"/> erm so anyway</u>

<u n="113" who="S0328">I don't think so I think I don't know actually I don't know bit there's a definite like clear thing that you have to do and he didn't do it so</u>
<u n="114" who="S0383">what so then he?</u>

<u n="118" who="S0383">oh is it at thingy?</u>
<u n="119" who="S0328">Railroad yeah so that's three weeks' worth of work erm and then I think you have to do like severance pay so he reckons about six hundred quid could be worse but like also sucks just to have to give it to her she's like <unclear/> but anyway</u>
<u n="120" who="S0383">what a dick for actually pursuing it as well</u>
<u n="121" who="S0328"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was like so you just have to get a job and then you get fired and then you'll get severance</u>
<u n="122" who="S0326"><vocal desc="laugh"/> plan sorted</u>
<u n="123" who="S0383">I'm sure like you know when like mad like people in really urban corporations get like fired cos they're like fucking prostitutes and then they get like two million pounds severance I'm sure people just do that on purpose</u>
<u n="124" who="S0328">hard to get another job then though</u>

<u n="1333" who="S0383">let me see where it's at? because I think it's like half built it's just like it's just got to be like touched up you know? it's just like it's built but it's just like</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0328">really? I thought nothing had been done on it</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0383">no it's like built to you know it's like you build the framework and then it's just like going back through the code cos you like the way you do it is like you build it and write all the code or whatever and then you'd be like oh that bit doesn't swirl properly you've got to like you know it's like a process of like fixing as opposed to like</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0328">yeah</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0383">so I think like that's done and it's just about like working out the bits so it's like yeah it's probably at a stage where you can just get someone else to look at that or but I feel like if we get someone else to work it out it'll just take longer</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0328">yeah</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0383">you know and it they'll be like well that's gonna cost <vocal desc="nonsense"/> whereas with us it's like I'm just like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you have to finish this</u>
<u n="1340" who="S0328"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="1341" who="S0383">did and like I can't wait to be able to lose my shit on him he's <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="1342" who="S0328">where did you meet him?</u>
<u n="1343" who="S0383">you know my friend <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>? there's like his</u>
<u n="1344" who="S0326">how do you how do you find them?</u>
<u n="1345" who="S0383">no but it's like I've known him for years <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> but I was never really like friends with him it's like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s wife <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> he's like her old school friend and he was always one of those like cos he used to work at <anon type="place"/> he had like really good jobs</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0328">he always struck me as a pothead</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0383">yeah he's like he totally is and he's like I told you he like made loads of money buying shit for <unclear/> and stuff like that he's like a bit of a blagger but then he had like a really good job at <anon type="place"/> and a really good job at like some other like 3D motion company but</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0328">what happened to those?</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0383">well it's since transpired that actually his friend this guy's <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> is basically like just like a whizz kid at code and he just got <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the jobs and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s just like the guy that knows a abut about everything but doesn't really do it so he like clung on to me to be like oh yeah you can do the design and clung on to this other guy to be like and it's just like <unclear>like I said</unclear> so he doesn't really do anything he's just but he's not even good at that</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0328">yeah</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0383">you know it's like if you're that like you become a project manager and you're like really good at overseeing stuff and getting like this is the timeline this is <vocal desc="nonsense"/></u>
<u n="1352" who="S0328">cos what he really did or what really happened to the whole thing is that it was really badly project managed</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0383">yeah</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0328">I mean that's like what went wrong basically like he just wasn't upfront about things</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0383">yeah yeah because <trunc>basi</trunc> but also basically it's like what really</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0328">didn't really run with it</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0383">yeah and it's just like even stuff it's like I'm like yo have you sent that email? he's like oh didn't forgot to press reply or and it's just like are you fucking retarded? like</u>
<u n="1358" who="S0328">yeah too stoned</u>
<u n="1359" who="S0383">but but also there's just too <trunc>ma</trunc> it's like it would have just been easier if we but also like that's the whole thing it's like it's not like confident putting him in a room with like  <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and that you know it's like?</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0328">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1361" who="S0383">but actually that would have been well easier if at the beginning we were just like okay guys what do you want? <vocal desc="nonsense"/> and then it's like we'd be at the stage that we've got to now which actually could have got done it two weeks</u>
<u n="1362" who="S0328">yeah but I didn't know he was going to suddenly like have a really really really strong idea about exactly what it is and to be honest I haven't even been looking at what he's been saying I've just been going yeah yeah fine make you happy but it's <trunc>pos</trunc> it's likely that I wouldn't even agree with him you know that I would have done it differently like I don't know when it became his thing he's not even one of it's just like he's <trunc>constan</trunc> I dunno it's super annoying man I don't know how we've got into this situation where</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0383">I don't know</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0328"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s like I'm going to <trunc>ch</trunc> and putting at retarded like the one bit I did read was like when he changed the home page text it was like I'm not saying that that's so lame</u>
<u n="1365" who="S0383">no but half the shit as well the thing that's really annoying is like when people propose stuff like maybe this will be a good idea and just be like I want this I want his and that kind of shit you can't be like oh maybe I want this and it's like actually no I want this and</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0328" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah I know well I <trunc>di</trunc> I did speak to him</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0383">but again that's like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s but that's like <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s shit cos like <trunc>ac</trunc> cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> kept you know when's like well we don't have all the stuff so I haven't done it I'm like if you need all the shit tell them that this is what you need</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0328">I told I was constantly saying do you have all the content you need from us? and he'd be like oh I need this one thing and that's it and I'd get him the thing and then he'd be like you know but like I was asking that all the time</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0383">that's what I mean like that's why I was trying to be like look like if you</u>
<u n="1370" who="S0328" trans="overlap">and now I'm like where is it? he hasn't even saved all the stuff I sent him I have to get it again</u>
<u n="1371" who="S0383">yeah but that's what I'm saying it's like but also it's like if that is the case you just be like look this is a stage we don't move on to that stage until this stage is complete rather than be like hey we have a bit coming in and cos then you're always like it's basically just not committing to something and just being like yeah we'll we'll like make it through like like we've always got an excuse you know it's always like a bit like yeah well we didn't do this because he didn't do that</u>
<u n="1372" who="S0328">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0383">and like de de it's like it doesn't matter if you need that to do that</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0328">should have got it</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0383">get it</u>
<u n="1376" who="S0328">oh man</u>
<u n="1377" who="S0383">it's just fucking tedious process</u>
<u n="1378" who="S0328">anyway what are we going to do to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> to get him?</u>
<u n="1379" who="S0383">well one the thing is I don't want to say anything to him until the site's done until we figure out what's happening with yours</u>
<u n="1380" who="S0328">yeah</u>
<u n="1381" who="S0383">and then like <trunc>lu</trunc> we haven't paid him the second half of this one yet anyway so we're definitely not paying him that</u>
<u n="1382" who="S0328">you should get it</u>
<u n="1383" who="S0383">erm but I just I just don't I want to keep him sweet until we get what we need out of him before we torture him</u>
<u n="1384" who="S0328">break his legs take away his weed take away his like Netflix subscription and like delete all the pizza delivery numbers from his phone</u>
<u n="1385" who="S0383">ruin him</u>
<u n="1386" who="S0328"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and what</u>
<u n="1387" who="S0326">what's the <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="1388" who="S0383">he he's just</u>
<u n="1389" who="S0328">some reason and I don't know why whenever I do stuff for YBFs it goes wrong I'm not I'm good at stuff like you know if I say I'm going to do something I do it like and I do it well like on my own stuff it's like fine I think it's happened before like I did a photo shoot and I got a friend and like somebody who was like I really thought was going to be great and he just did like an awful job</u>
<u n="1390" who="S0383">really?</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0328">we can never use the photos so for some reason I just things go wrong when I do it for anyone else apart from me almost like <unclear/></u>
<u n="1392" who="S0326">maybe cos you get your friends to do it</u>
<u n="1393" who="S0328">no like no more than I do in normal thing and like this guy was like it's like somebody <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> always works with and like was really highly recommended and like should have been great he just got it wrong he just fucked it up wasted loads of people's time waste of money</u>
<u n="1394" who="S0383">yeah</u>
<u n="1395" who="S0328">but also to an extent maybe that's like not being used to working with other people who have opinions any more cos like if it's my thing I just do it I know if it's right if I'm trying to please somebody else and like guess what they want then it's like</u>
<u n="1396" who="S0383">that's the thing is that you're constantly second guessing</u>
<u n="1397" who="S0328">yeah</u>
<u n="1398" who="S0383">but it's the <trunc>shi</trunc> it's the same shit as like when I was working for that guy <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> in <anon type="place"/> it's like he was the one who had the relations with the client but I was like <trunc>li</trunc> I was like delivering to him to then <trunc>deli</trunc> I was trying to</u>
<u n="1399" who="S0328">yeah</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0383">understand what he wanted to be the what he wanted me to deliver to him to deliver to the client rather than him just being like you guy you can speak to the client and then I know what they delivered so it's like I was second guessing what he wants or am I doing something that the client wants</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0328">yeah</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0383">cos I know what he's asked for they're not going to want to so it's like</u>
