<u n="31" who="S0041">fuck off</u>
<u n="32" who="S0084">nightmare <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> she's just a retard <pause dur="short"/> she's just everything is really hard in her life <pause dur="short"/> and I can't hold her hand <pause dur="short"/> like we have catch up meetings in production um in my team with the editors every two weeks <pause dur="short"/> to just talk about whatever's going on <pause dur="short"/> budget <pause dur="short"/> schedules <pause dur="short"/> issues with the proofs <pause dur="short"/> whatever <pause dur="short"/> marketing don't come <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> you know it's not really relevant <pause dur="short"/> that's why they have no idea about the schedule <pause dur="short"/> so they have no idea <pause dur="short"/> they have no concept of the priority of your deadlines <pause dur="short"/> they've got they don't care <pause dur="short"/> so you e-mail them and say okay well this is absolutely what I need from you <pause dur="short"/> and I really need it by this date <pause dur="short"/> oh right <pause dur="short"/> and that just goes off</u>
<u n="33" who="S0041">what?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0084">somewhere <pause dur="short"/> they're just not interested <pause dur="short"/> and they're not made to come to this meeting</u>
<u n="35" who="S0041">who's</u>
<u n="36" who="S0084">whereas if they were</u>
<u n="37" who="S0041">who's supposed to make them?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0084">well interestingly er interestingly enough the head of marketing left in November <pause dur="short"/> what month are we in now? March <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah March <pause dur="short"/> yeah they have no head <pause dur="short"/> um so it's just I mean it was a shambles before <pause dur="short"/> and it's er carrying on being a shambles <pause dur="short"/> so <trunc>s</trunc> the director of corporate affairs is supposed to be heading up the section <pause dur="short"/> but he that means he's in charge of like I dunno a hundred people <pause dur="short"/> and he he's off doing his own job <pause dur="short"/> so in theory they report to him <pause dur="short"/> but they don't <pause dur="short"/> and he if even if he tried</u>
<u n="39" who="S0041">and really need</u>
<u n="40" who="S0084">to call a meeting about it they'd be like he's like well we'll just wait for the new person <pause dur="short"/> but there's no sort of er date by which er the new person's gonna be in place</u>
<u n="41" who="S0041">what?</u>
<u n="42" who="S0084">huh <pause dur="short"/> it's just a fucking joke <pause dur="short"/> absolutely it just makes you so angry <pause dur="short"/> and like the thing is the the <trunc>peop</trunc> er the people that you rile at understand and know</u>
<u n="43" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0084">and they know that it's bad <pause dur="short"/> I think someone's got to take responsibility</u>
<u n="45" who="S0041">they could just employ me <pause dur="short"/> interim period <pause dur="short"/> three months</u>
<u n="46" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="47" who="S0041">bosh bosh <pause dur="short"/> off you go</u>
<u n="48" who="S0084">absolutely</u>
<u n="49" who="S0041">that'd be great</u>
<u n="50" who="S0084">well they're supposed to be going through this</u>
<u n="51" who="S0041">they could just pay me for a little while and then</u>
<u n="52" who="S0084">you could be like a consultant <pause dur="short"/> consultancy fee</u>
<u n="53" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was gonna do that actually <trunc>actu</trunc></u>
<u n="54" who="S0084"><unclear/></u>
<u n="55" who="S0041"><unclear/> finish the last place</u>
<u n="56" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> nice</u>
<u n="57" who="S0041"><unclear/> consultancy <pause dur="short"/> but I <trunc>d</trunc> the the clients that I knew that would pay for me automatically</u>
<u n="58" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="59" who="S0041">would basically make me the same wages I could do sat there <pause dur="short"/> so I just thought well</u>
<u n="60" who="S0084">oh <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> you wouldn't wanna do it if they're gonna pay you a hundred pounds a day</u>
<u n="61" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="62" who="S0084">well that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> they've been paying someone a consultancy fee for the last year</u>
<u n="63" who="S0041">huh</u>
<u n="64" who="S0084">in order to introduce new um process review <pause dur="short"/> like a process review and then get everybody doing work in the same way <pause dur="short"/> why they weren't in the first place fine whatever</u>
<u n="65" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="66" who="S0084">they weren't <pause dur="short"/> so it's taken them the best part of two years to do this <pause dur="short"/> ever since I've been there they've been doing it <pause dur="short"/> and er finally finally the role out is next month <pause dur="short"/> but you just think with no head of marketing <pause dur="short"/> with no one to drive it</u>
<u n="67" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0084">they're not gonna do it</u>
<u n="69" who="S0041">doesn't matter</u>
<u n="70" who="S0084">you're still gonna have to hold their hand <pause dur="short"/> you're still gonna have to tell them what you need and when</u>
<u n="71" who="S0041">which</u>
<u n="72" who="S0084">rather than being proactive</u>
<u n="73" who="S0041">is extra work for you</u>
<u n="74" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's <unclear/> completely ridiculous</u>
<u n="75" who="S0041">that's you doing your own job and then making sure somebody else does theirs <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="76" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0041">if they don't do their own job they're fired <pause dur="short"/> end of story</u>
<u n="78" who="S0084">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's what er it got escalated to my operations boss <pause dur="short"/> who's sort of my boss while <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s away <pause dur="short"/> um cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said this is fucking ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said you know it's only because we work our arses off to make sure that that covers are actually there in time for the books to be printed <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> it's only by the grace of God the books actually end up with a  with a  cover is <trunc>th</trunc></u>
<u n="79" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0084">certainly not through marketing <pause dur="short"/> and she said actually you kind of want a massive cock-up for them to take er</u>
<u n="81" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0084">responsibility <pause dur="short"/> um er I mean even at Christmas we had a um an instance where all the books were printed you know two thousand copies had been printed with no covers <pause dur="short"/> which meant that they manually then had to <vocal desc="laugh"/> add the covers after <pause dur="short"/> because the covers weren't signed off <pause dur="short"/> it's a fucking nightmare</u>
<u n="83" who="S0041">two thousand books?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0084">two thousand books <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> they had to manually do it <pause dur="short"/> which is completely ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> cos er what you should do is then just feed it straight through <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> and that was the marketing team <pause dur="short"/> because they decided to have a massive rebrand of the exams covers last summer</u>
<u n="85" who="S0041">gosh</u>
<u n="86" who="S0084">oh don't get me started <pause dur="short"/> yeah so I'm quite looking forward to a beer <pause dur="short"/> but I thought I'd better have a shower first in case you know drown <pause dur="short"/> oh well also these fucking recordings that I've been doing <pause dur="short"/> I submitted all my invoices and I er would've the eighteen pounds an hour that I get I'd calculated that for the number of hours I'd recorded I would've got paid three hundred and fifty-five pounds</u>
<u n="87" who="S0041">oh</u>
<u n="88" who="S0084">but in my head I forgot that they would tax me on that <pause dur="short"/> but I thought I would get paid at the end of the month <pause dur="short"/> because that's when invoices get paid <pause dur="short"/> like our back salary comes out on the eighteenth <pause dur="short"/> so today there was an extra hundred and fifty pounds in my bank in my salary <pause dur="short"/> cos I get paid today <pause dur="short"/> and I was like oh is that must  that must  be the recordings but it's two hundred quid shy</u>
<u n="89" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="90" who="S0084">and then I thought well er well they'll have taxed me</u>
<u n="91" who="S0041">not two hundred quid though</u>
<u n="92" who="S0084">but shit yeah <pause dur="short"/> so but the but one of the invoices was missing <pause dur="short"/> so in the end it was actually two hundred and fifty pounds but <trunc>bec</trunc> but with tax it was only a hundred and fifty</u>
<u n="93" who="S0041">benefits</u>
<u n="94" who="S0084">huh fuck me</u>
<u n="95" who="S0041">it's <trunc>ab</trunc> that is just disgusting isn't it</u>
<u n="96" who="S0084">A hundred pounds  hundred pounds</u>
<u n="97" who="S0041">that can't be right</u>
<u n="98" who="S0084">well er</u>
<u n="99" who="S0041">that can't be right</u>
<u n="100" who="S0084">I've chased it up with our payroll and I've said have you charged me at forty percent rather than twenty percent? Um and they said yeah we've charged you at twenty percent <pause dur="short"/> and it'll be your national insurance which is twelve percent and your student loan which is nine percent</u>
<u n="101" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="102" who="S0084">so it comes out at forty percent <pause dur="short"/> so it's a fucking joke <pause dur="short"/> forty percent? Er you <trunc>ju</trunc> you might as well just die</u>
<u n="103" who="S0041">oh my God</u>
<u n="104" who="S0084">I mean what the hell? So that really fucked me off</u>
<u n="105" who="S0041">that's horrendous</u>
<u n="106" who="S0084">Cos er I mean I you know I'm not really relying on it but it would've been really good</u>
<u n="107" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0084">Cos I need to get out of my overdraft this year <pause dur="short"/> that was the plan <pause dur="short"/> tut fine <pause dur="short"/> it just pisses me off</u>
<u n="109" who="S0041">that is such a pisser <pause dur="short"/> I'm gonna go to work tomorrow and ring the tax office about my tax code</u>
<u n="110" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0041">huh <pause dur="short"/> I'm just grateful that it's now the end of the tax year so I can rebate this past year <pause dur="short"/> cos they owe me at least three hundred</u>
<u n="112" who="S0084">do they?</u>
<u n="113" who="S0041">from this year alone <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0084">okay <pause dur="short"/> nice <pause dur="short"/> er yeah you've gotta keep an eye on them because er <trunc>w</trunc> last year when I got a tax rebate from when I worked I think it was from when I worked at Waterstones they massively taxed me and um cos I worked at Waterstones at the same time as I went back for Christmas so it was like a second job</u>
<u n="115" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0084">um and I got a rebate <pause dur="short"/> but I didn't get my rebate until November <pause dur="short"/> it took them from May to November <pause dur="short"/> so what is that? Five months <pause dur="short"/> six months</u>
<u n="117" who="S0041">God</u>
<u n="118" who="S0084">to pull their finger out</u>
<u n="119" who="S0041">it's such a piss-take</u>
<u n="120" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="121" who="S0041">actual piss-take</u>
<u n="122" who="S0084">you know <pause dur="short"/> unless you actually write the letters and chase them which is what I did when I was at uni cos you need the money more when you're at uni you know <pause dur="short"/> at least when I was earning I had money coming in <pause dur="short"/> but you rely on them that's the thing</u>
<u n="123" who="S0041">I know</u>
<u n="124" who="S0084">they're the tax office</u>
<u n="125" who="S0041">so I've got them to contact <pause dur="short"/> I've got my bank to contact <pause dur="short"/> cos they've charged me a hundred and fifty quid for something</u>
<u n="126" who="S0084">huh</u>
<u n="127" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0084">what?</u>
<u n="129" who="S0041">something's happened <pause dur="short"/> right basically I've got two accounts</u>
<u n="130" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0041">which are both at their overdraft limit <pause dur="short"/> as usual</u>
<u n="132" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0041">since I've taken this job <pause dur="short"/> one of them tax free student sixteen hundred quid bosh</u>
<u n="134" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0041">it's two hundred I paid two hundred and fifty off it so they don't really give a crap until this next September or something</u>
<u n="136" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0041">fine <pause dur="short"/> good for me <pause dur="short"/> the other one is five hundred interest overdraft <pause dur="short"/> so I pay about depending on how much I'm in the overdraft by which is usually the whole fricking lot I pay about a tenner a month</u>
<u n="138" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0041">interest on it <pause dur="short"/> fine <pause dur="short"/> and when the <trunc>s</trunc> that stupid Swinton thing was coming out of my</u>
<u n="140" who="S0084">tut</u>
<u n="141" who="S0041">account</u>
<u n="142" who="S0084">oh yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0041">and we didn't know what it was <pause dur="short"/> I'd gone over my overdraft limit and they charged me blahdy blah blah <pause dur="short"/> anyway these charges have just racked up <pause dur="short"/> and I went in and they said oh well for every day you're over your overdraft limit we charge you twelve pounds or something</u>
<u n="144" who="S0084">per day?</u>
<u n="145" who="S0041">per day right <pause dur="short"/> and at the time I was in such a fluster I didn't listen <pause dur="short"/> and I just said what? No way <pause dur="short"/> and then I thought about it <pause dur="short"/> I thought that's a lie <pause dur="short"/> I've had that overdraft at that overdraft limit since I was eighteen years old <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> it has been there for a hell of a long time</u>
<u n="146" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0041">and never once have I been charged per day like that <pause dur="short"/> never <pause dur="short"/> I've had</u>
<u n="148" who="S0084">they can change the terms though <pause dur="short"/> have you had any letters?</u>
<u n="149" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="150" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="151" who="S0041">I haven't had anything <pause dur="short"/> so I think they've changed the terms of my overdraft</u>
<u n="152" who="S0084">and not told you</u>
<u n="153" who="S0041">and not told me</u>
<u n="154" who="S0084">Cos they just basically write to me and tell me they'd <trunc>s</trunc> they'd changed the terms <pause dur="short"/> but there's fuck all you can do about it because you need your overdraft <pause dur="short"/> so if er cos if if you're fifteen hundred pounds into your overdraft which thankfully I'm not anymore and then they say right well actually the interest free bit's over now <pause dur="short"/> bye bye <pause dur="short"/> we're gonna start charging you at nineteen percent <pause dur="short"/> you're fucked <pause dur="short"/> there's nothing you can do</u>
<u n="155" who="S0041">really?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's what happened to me <pause dur="short"/> and then you've gotta get out as soon as as er humanly possible you've gotta clear your overdraft <pause dur="short"/> because that's what they do <pause dur="short"/> they lower your er graduate account or your student account the interest free amount</u>
<u n="157" who="S0041">and then flip it</u>
<u n="158" who="S0084">and then flip it</u>
<u n="159" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="160" who="S0084">over to interest <pause dur="short"/> er which is what I was expecting to be doing them to do at five hundred pound intervals</u>
<u n="161" who="S0041">yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="162" who="S0084">and then one day they just wrote to me and said right you've got</u>
<u n="163" who="S0041">and said no</u>
<u n="164" who="S0084">no you've gotta pay</u>
<u n="165" who="S0041">oh shit <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> if they do that I'm fucked</u>
<u n="166" who="S0084">and they charge you twenty-five pounds arrangement fee</u>
<u n="167" who="S0041">for doing it?</u>
<u n="168" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> for doing nothing <pause dur="short"/> press er pushing in a button on the computer</u>

<u n="228" who="S0084">mm</u>

<u n="449" who="S0084">well</u>
<u n="450" who="S0041">it would be</u>
<u n="451" who="S0084">it would be easier <pause dur="short"/> but I mean you might get there and them go oh well you can't have access to the archive <pause dur="short"/> oh and then that would be worse because you'd probably punch her in the face</u>
<u n="452" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I thought also about</u>
<u n="453" who="S0084">how frustrating</u>
<u n="454" who="S0041">writing <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> a letter saying</u>
<u n="455" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="456" who="S0041">I thought I'll keep the  I'll print the  and just say look I don't know what type of staff you're employing but there's <trunc>cl</trunc> clearly a bit of a communication problem here</u>

<u n="460" who="S0041">to collect it I will be claiming back my mileage</u>

<u n="462" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="463" who="S0084">you were a student once</u>
<u n="464" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="465" who="S0084">do you know what I mean? It's not like you you you exit out the door</u>
<u n="466" who="S0041">it's not a big school Liz</u>
<u n="467" who="S0084">really?</u>
<u n="468" who="S0041">it's not a big school <pause dur="short"/> it's not like a city school with thousands of students</u>

<u n="486" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="487" who="S0084">I mean you're better off you know you'd prefer to be on the phone to some retard than having to actually you know strike up communication with your mum</u>
<u n="488" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so that was</u>

<u n="520" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I don't  I don't  know <pause dur="short"/> I I huh</u>
<u n="521" who="S0084">is it purely financial then? Or do you just think you'll have more fun? Or?</u>
<u n="522" who="S0041">I I think I would have more fun</u>
<u n="523" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="524" who="S0041">which is what I'd I'm thinking this is gonna be my whole life</u>
<u n="525" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and and it's short term as well <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="526" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="527" who="S0084">so it's only <trunc>gon</trunc> if you are only gonna sign up for four years</u>
<u n="528" who="S0041">you want to make the most of that</u>
<u n="529" who="S0084"><trunc>w</trunc> you wanna have the best time</u>
<u n="530" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="531" who="S0084">you know it's not er you don't  you don't  I suppose you don't know but you don't know whether it's gonna be fifteen years <pause dur="short"/> you know if it's fifteen years you might wanna go in as an officer and really you know work your arse off and</u>
<u n="532" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="533" who="S0084">make it your career <pause dur="short"/> but if you're only gonna do it for four years</u>
<u n="534" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> or even</u>
<u n="535" who="S0084">might as well</u>
<u n="536" who="S0041">six years</u>
<u n="537" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="538" who="S0041">but I thought you know you don't go to work do your job and come home</u>
<u n="539" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="540" who="S0041">you don't</u>
<u n="541" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="542" who="S0041">your home life is with the people that you work with all the time</u>
<u n="543" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="544" who="S0041">and if you don't like the people you work with cos er per vessel per ship there's only eighteen officers out of the two hundred people on that ship</u>
<u n="545" who="S0084">oh really?</u>
<u n="546" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="547" who="S0084">wow</u>
<u n="548" who="S0041">there's a real big difference <pause dur="short"/> and so I thought I know it sounds awful but I thought huh if they're all kiss arses</u>
<u n="549" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="550" who="S0041">and not fun at all and I'm stuck with two people that I would actually be friends with</u>
<u n="551" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="552" who="S0041">that's really not gonna be a nice lifestyle for months and months  and months  at a time</u>
<u n="553" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="554" who="S0041">so that's that's my only thing <pause dur="short"/> my think my thought process <pause dur="short"/> because really graduate-wise the majority of them are boring fuckers</u>
<u n="555" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="556" who="S0041">like people that are gonna go in there <trunc>en</trunc> doing engineering</u>
<u n="557" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="558" who="S0041">and <trunc>s</trunc> satellite navigation stuff</u>
<u n="559" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="560" who="S0041">at officer level are gonna be pretty clued up</u>
<u n="561" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="562" who="S0041">I can't imagine there being a lot of fun</u>
<u n="563" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="564" who="S0041">I can't  I can't  see it <pause dur="short"/> so I just I <trunc>c</trunc> I think intellectually I'd be much happier doing the officer job</u>
<u n="565" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="566" who="S0041">but I'd be willing to sacrifice that if I would enjoy my time there</u>
<u n="567" who="S0084"><vocal desc="cough"/> Well absolutely <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I mean that's what life's about isn't it <pause dur="short"/> you've gotta really enjoy it</u>
<u n="568" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="569" who="S0084">ultimately <pause dur="short"/> but um what was I gonna say? Like what would your responsibilities be if you were just ratings? Like what would you be doing? What would your job be?</u>
<u n="570" who="S0041">that's what I wanna know</u>
<u n="571" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="572" who="S0041">Cos I don't really know <pause dur="short"/> er because Michael can't I had him on the phone last night for two and a half hours</u>
<u n="573" who="S0084">shit</u>
<u n="574" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> two and a half hours <pause dur="short"/> I mean a lot of it was not navy-related</u>
<u n="575" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="576" who="S0041">but he's like I can't really describe it to you cos you do so many different things all the time</u>
<u n="577" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="578" who="S0041">if you were as a rating</u>
<u n="579" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="580" who="S0041">then it's really changed <pause dur="short"/> so you'd be he said I don't <trunc>kn</trunc> I can't tell you <pause dur="short"/> er he was like</u>
<u n="581" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="582" who="S0041">if I was gonna choose that's what I'd do</u>
<u n="583" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="584" who="S0041">Cos he's a communications specialist <pause dur="short"/> which is like one below</u>
<u n="585" who="S0084">oh okay</u>
<u n="586" who="S0041">so the progression path for both is different</u>
<u n="587" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="588" who="S0041">I don't think I don't know if er he obviously can't cross over <pause dur="short"/> or if he can he can't do it or something <pause dur="short"/> I dunno</u>
<u n="589" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="590" who="S0041">but an officer he said basically he spends quite a lot of time pretty standard <pause dur="short"/> I said what do you mean? He said you well like you know in front of a computer <pause dur="short"/> making decisions <pause dur="short"/> going to meetings <pause dur="short"/> doing the paperwork <pause dur="short"/> writing reports for the ratings <pause dur="short"/> so it sounds very much like a manager job anywhere</u>
<u n="591" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="592" who="S0041">with more fun thrown in <pause dur="short"/> he said the only thing I can see you getting fucked off with is that because you're at the same level for so long a lot of your time will be training for you as well</u>
<u n="593" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="594" who="S0041">and they just <trunc>p</trunc> they spend a lot  a lot  of time planning <pause dur="short"/> and I am a planner <pause dur="short"/> I do it now <pause dur="short"/> it fucks me off though  fucks me off</u>
<u n="595" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="596" who="S0041">and they er they plan for stuff and it's not even real stuff <pause dur="short"/> it's test stuff</u>
<u n="597" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="598" who="S0041">so you might spend he said you might spend three or four weeks planning</u>
<u n="599" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="600" who="S0041">for a fake attack that never</u>
<u n="601" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="602" who="S0041">is never gonna actually happen</u>
<u n="603" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> seems a bit redundant doesn't it</u>
<u n="604" who="S0041">yeah it does</u>
<u n="605" who="S0084">but then I suppose that's that's the nature of the beast isn't it <pause dur="short"/> they rely on people like you <pause dur="short"/> like you could spin it on its head <pause dur="short"/> yeah the your test doesn't come up but it means that you're prepared because it could and in fact in real life it could <pause dur="short"/> so it's better</u>
<u n="606" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="607" who="S0084">to be prepared <pause dur="short"/> and at least you know <pause dur="short"/> cos you er ultimately you don't wanna be in a position where you sort of let your guard down <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean? Like you're really responsible</u>
<u n="608" who="S0041">that's it</u>
<u n="609" who="S0084">you're responsible for people's safety <pause dur="short"/> for their lives</u>
<u n="610" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="611" who="S0084">and and if that means that you know you're preparing for something that never actually happens in reality it could happen</u>
<u n="612" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="613" who="S0084">and you wanna make sure that you're prepared for it</u>
<u n="614" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="615" who="S0084">so it's what it's how you get satisfaction from your job I suppose</u>
<u n="616" who="S0041">that's what I'm thinking <pause dur="short"/> and am I really gonna get satisfaction out of doing that?</u>
<u n="617" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="618" who="S0041">I don't know</u>
<u n="619" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="620" who="S0041">until I actually know what they do from day to day <pause dur="short"/> I want somebody to say if I was to plan you an average week in this job this is what you can expect to do</u>
<u n="621" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="622" who="S0041">if someone I don't think it's too much to expect</u>
<u n="623" who="S0084">oh no</u>
<u n="624" who="S0041">if somebody <trunc>c</trunc> asked me to my job I'd be able to tell them</u>
