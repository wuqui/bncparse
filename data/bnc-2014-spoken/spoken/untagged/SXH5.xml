<u n="1" who="S0653">okay so you were gonna tell me about what you learnt about recycling <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="2" who="S0654">I learnt that <vocal desc="sigh"/> some bit that er the first piece of plastic ever made is still alive today and that plastic cannot rot put it in the bin it's still there it's not gone and <event desc="sound of eating"/> <pause dur="short"/> erm do you know what?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0653">mm?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0654">there's so much plastic that in the sea which er and it could circle the <trunc>w</trunc> earth four times</u>
<u n="5" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="6" who="S0654">and if it goes outside and I think don't think people are taking care then because I cos er today I see loads of wrappers everywhere</u>
<u n="7" who="S0653">we did spot some rubbish didn't we? on the way back from school</u>
<u n="8" who="S0654">yeah and <event desc="sound of eating"/> do you know what?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0653">what?</u>
<u n="10" who="S0654">animals can die of plastic</u>
<u n="11" who="S0653">how can they die from plastic?</u>
<u n="12" who="S0654">cos like if they've got a sharp bit of plastic or and it's fraying <unclear>a worm could</unclear> come up and get hurt</u>
<u n="13" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0655">oh <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="15" who="S0653">yes <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0655">mm erm er maybe last year or the year before at some point people found a dead whale on the beach and they <trunc>wante</trunc> or dolphin and they wanted to know why it was dead erm so they looked inside it</u>
<u n="17" who="S0653">mm?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0655">and there was like a huge load of rubbish inside it</u>
<u n="19" who="S0653">oh no really?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0655">yeah it was swimming in the sea and it and it got all of it in its mouth and it died because of that so some er so some people have just been chucking their rubbish in the sea</u>
<u n="21" who="S0653">well sometimes it ends up in the sea</u>
<u n="22" who="S0655">yeah well they haven't been putting it away</u>
<u n="23" who="S0653">but where does it go? cos you went to see where it rubbish goes didn't you <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>? last year?</u>
<u n="24" who="S0655">what on a school trip?</u>
<u n="25" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="26" who="S0655">nope</u>
<u n="27" who="S0653"><anon type="name" nameType="n"/> <pause dur="short"/> you did</u>
<u n="28" who="S0655">I might've but I don't remember it</u>
<u n="29" who="S0653">do you guys know where the rubbish goes when it's collected?</u>
<u n="30" who="S0655">yeah they go underground</u>
<u n="31" who="S0653">it <trunc>g</trunc> not really it goes to a big landfill site</u>
<u n="32" who="S0655">yeah where they bury it</u>
<u n="33" who="S0653">they don't bury it it's just there so</u>
<u n="34" who="S0654"><unclear/></u>
<u n="35" who="S0653">you know we have three different bins? what are the three different bins for?</u>
<u n="36" who="S0654">they're for food</u>
<u n="37" who="S0655">recycling</u>
<u n="38" who="S0654">and <trunc>plast</trunc> and erm</u>
<u n="39" who="S0655"><unclear>not</unclear></u>
<u n="40" who="S0653">and <trunc>gen</trunc>general waste <vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="41" who="S0655">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0654">general waste</u>
<u n="43" who="S0655">non-recyclable but not food</u>
<u n="44" who="S0653">yeah</u>
<u n="45" who="S0654" whoConfidence="low">yeah mm mum?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0653">and that's what goes to the landfill</u>
<u n="47" who="S0654">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0653">mm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0654">and I think every bit of plastic we have like that container we recycle</u>
<u n="50" who="S0653">we do although I think you can't recycle erm plastic if er if meat has been on it even if you wash it I can't remember</u>
<u n="51" who="S0655">but I know a great way to get rid of plastic</u>
<u n="52" who="S0653">mm?</u>
<u n="53" who="S0655">dig down quite deep find some lava pour it on the plastic and it sizzles away</u>
<u n="54" who="S0653">well that is a good theory actually perhaps we could all put stuff into a volcano</u>
<u n="55" who="S0654">mum</u>
<u n="56" who="S0655">no not into a volcano</u>
<u n="57" who="S0653">I'm being serious</u>
<u n="58" who="S0655">because er when it <trunc>e</trunc> because if the volcano was like able to erupt</u>
<u n="59" who="S0653">mm?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0655">then it might erupt and there will bits of plastic still left in the lava</u>
<u n="61" who="S0653">no no it would it would burn but how do you think you can get to the lava without the lava coming up to us?</u>
<u n="62" who="S0655">mm</u>
<u n="63" who="S0653">you see?</u>
<u n="64" who="S0655">exact timing</u>
<u n="65" who="S0653">it's pretty well it's pretty dangerous isn't it?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0654">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0655">some people have been near volcanoes <unclear>although</unclear> lava is generally travels slow slowly so</u>
<u n="68" who="S0653" trans="overlap">no no that's a good idea <pause dur="short"/> I think we could drop stuff into the volcano</u>
<u n="69" who="S0655">unless the volcano did a gigantic spitting eruption which it where it goes kaboom then you'd probably be safe</u>
<u n="70" who="S0654" trans="overlap"><unclear/> mum don't</u>
<u n="71" who="S0653">why not <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="72" who="S0654">because mum some volcanoes are known to hold treasures in</u>
<u n="73" who="S0653">known to hold treasure? are they?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0655">no they're not you just watched Tom and Jerry</u>
<u n="75" who="S0654">no I didn't</u>
<u n="76" who="S0653"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="77" who="S0654">no some no I've heard that some volcanoes are so special that nobody puts anything in</u>
<u n="78" who="S0653">I don't think I've ever heard that</u>
<u n="79" who="S0654">well I've heard it</u>
<u n="80" who="S0655">well I'm just going to ask a volcano expert about that</u>
<u n="81" who="S0653">we did used to burn rubbish but then we realised that the burning was very bad for the environment yeah cos of carbon monoxide and things but if a volcano is already burning <pause dur="short"/> I think that yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0655" trans="overlap">for the air <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> mm maybe if we dug a tunnel through the centre of the earth</u>
<u n="83" who="S0653">maybe if you done dug a tunnel to the centre of the earth?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0655">if we dug a tunnel to the centre of the earth</u>
<u n="85" who="S0653">mm?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0655">like really near to it</u>
<u n="87" who="S0653">mm?</u>
<u n="88" who="S0655">like close enough for us to drop it it's close enough for us to see the all the lava inside it or just to find some lava underground mm and then</u>
<u n="89" who="S0653">mm?</u>
<u n="90" who="S0655">they could drop the rubbish in and it would either sizzle away or explode</u>
<u n="91" who="S0653">I think that would make for a very unstable tunnel though and it</u>
<u n="92" who="S0655">what do you mean?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0653">because of the heat and did you know the gravitational pull it does pull things into the centre of the earth so if we got too near people were digging they'd just get sucked into that bit</u>
<u n="94" who="S0655">mm they <trunc>w</trunc> we would turn rubbish alive and it would dig inside</u>
<u n="95" who="S0653">well how's that gonna happen?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0655">cos they would go whee <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="97" who="S0653">I think it's a kind of quite a a dangerous option but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> we do recycle our recycling bin has got paper and glass and plastic in it so that is recycled</u>
<u n="98" who="S0654">yeah <unclear>as if I was saving</unclear> the ketchup bottle for something</u>
<u n="99" who="S0653">I don't want us to start recycling things because er well however we are going to keep this ketchup bottle because we're going to do that pancake recipe where you can do do two different types of pancake mixture so</u>
<u n="100" who="S0654">hey</u>
<u n="101" who="S0653">I guess we'll be reusing it that way mm?</u>
<u n="102" who="S0654">we'd erm soon we might need to get my <unclear/> a container for the <unclear>forest school</unclear></u>
<u n="103" who="S0653"><unclear/> for the forest? for what?</u>
<u n="104" who="S0654">might need to get a container for <unclear>forest school</unclear></u>
<u n="105" who="S0653">for forest school? what do you need a container for?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0654">you know the small container for drink</u>
<u n="107" who="S0653">you just need a carton or a bottle but</u>

<u n="142" who="S0653">well we don't as I say we're not allowed to just throw plastic away any more we have to put it in a recycling bin <pause dur="short"/> so that's good at least</u>
