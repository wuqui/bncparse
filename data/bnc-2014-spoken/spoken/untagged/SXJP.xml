<u n="25" who="S0441" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="26" who="S0439">the money from the rent of the house should pretty much</u>
<u n="27" who="S0441" trans="overlap">that's it</u>
<u n="28" who="S0439" trans="overlap">go to pay off the mortgage</u>

<u n="33" who="S0441">very bad for her <pause dur="short"/> I think we had our suspicions just the the way the house is really</u>
<u n="34" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0441">I mean if she was that much of a dedicated landlady she would have</u>
<u n="36" who="S0439">done more to look after it actually</u>

<u n="45" who="S0441">yeah I don't know how that works though and that's really really sneaky because of well I I did a bit of reading up on the internet after <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> told me but apparently <trunc>t</trunc> some tenants that can't pay their mortgage if you've got tenants in you have a two month grace period</u>
<u n="46" who="S0439">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0441">so I guess some apparently some landlady or landlords say that they erm get new tenants in knowing that they might get their house repossessed so they can have that extra two months</u>

<u n="85" who="S0441">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0439">and don't get me wrong I don't think there is <trunc>as</trunc> like an expiry date on when you should tell someone that you love them but after after eleven months you've got to kind of be a bit like</u>
<u n="87" who="S0441">maybe <unclear>really for their sakes</unclear></u>

<u n="91" who="S0441"><unclear/></u>

<u n="98" who="S0439"><unclear>spoon yeah</unclear> erm yeah and so they were arguing all weekend about he's just like everything I do for you you don't care about you know like erm <pause dur="short"/> I cook you dinner and you think that and you criticise me because I don't tell you that I care you know actions speak louder than word and I'm showing you that I care but I'm like but it's not like for girls you need that verbal affirmation as well it's just a thing <pause dur="short"/> like I do think actions are important don't get me wrong but I think all girls also do need that verbal confirmation it's just</u>
<u n="99" who="S0441">I dunno <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> will never tells me he loves me I mean he has told me he loves me but he rarely ever tells me</u>
<u n="100" who="S0439">but does he tell you things like he thinks you're pretty?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0441">no</u>
<u n="102" who="S0439">really?</u>
<u n="103" who="S0441">not really</u>
<u n="104" who="S0439">mm <pause dur="short"/> I dunno maybe it depends on the person like for me it doesn't bother me too much but I think for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> it's important cos she has low self esteem</u>
<u n="105" who="S0441">and that to be fair if if she thinks it's important and he knows that then he should make the effort</u>
<u n="106" who="S0439">yeah like she has low self esteem she has this disability you know she already thinks that she's not a super well he isn't a supermodel <unclear>right and stuff</unclear> you know none of them are are they? <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="107" who="S0441">I'm sure if I told <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> like I really need you to tell me that you I don't know then he probably would if it meant that much to me <trunc>w</trunc> you know but</u>
<u n="108" who="S0439">erm</u>
<u n="109" who="S0441" trans="overlap">I guess</u>
<u n="110" who="S0439"><unclear>and today</unclear></u>
<u n="111" who="S0441" trans="overlap">that's <trunc>p</trunc>perhaps why he's not really very</u>
<u n="112" who="S0439">so they spent the whole weekend arguing about that really him being like you never appreciate what I do you know I cooked you dinner last week and you don't care blah blah blah and she's like I do care you know it's really important to me and sometimes I just need you to tell me that you actually like me you know and that would reassure me and</u>
<u n="113" who="S0441" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0439">and it er and went I mean it er it <trunc>li</trunc> just went round in circles to be honest it was but because she knows my opinion on it she doesn't ask</u>
<u n="115" who="S0441">no</u>
<u n="116" who="S0439" trans="overlap">and I don't offer it's a really nice easy relationship you know</u>
<u n="117" who="S0441" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0439">she knows what I think she knows that I don't particularly like him and he's the one on her birthday who got angry because I had said that he was shy and I didn't want him to be shy cos he was meeting like all her friends for the first time and was like you know I hear you're a bit er shy but don't worry and he got really angry at her</u>
<u n="119" who="S0441">yeah I know I remember you saying that</u>
<u n="120" who="S0439">erm so like I kind of think he's a bit of a twat anyway but <pause dur="short"/> so she knows what I think of him so it would be it <trunc>w</trunc> it was fine like she didn't <pause dur="short"/> erm you know <trunc>w</trunc> she didn't get angry</u>
<u n="121" who="S0441" trans="overlap">it didn't bother her too much?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0439">no</u>
<u n="123" who="S0441">that's good</u>
<u n="124" who="S0439">cos through the weekend it didn't bother but then we got on the flight and she started to cry</u>
<u n="125" who="S0441">ah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0439">and then the moment we got back to the airport and obviously you get wifi and stuff her phone went off and it was him being like you know you're a bitch you know you don't appreciate me you know you just want me to say this but I'm not gonna say it until I'm ready and he isn't he's never gonna say it cos he's he just he just doesn't love her and it's really sad but she keeps like hoping that one day he will and <pause dur="short"/> and she started crying at the airport and I was like I've really got to get my bus so I kind of walked I was like I'm really sorry she was like no no go so I went down and I was like you know what? I'll just cos her bus was another hour to go she had to wait an hour at the airport for her bus and I was like I'll just drive into Oxford so I drove her all the way to Oxford yeah I know</u>

<u n="133" who="S0441" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0439">and we listened to music on the way home so but she just she just has that hope that they're gonna work and it's just like</u>
<u n="135" who="S0441" trans="overlap">mm give up the ghost now <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="136" who="S0439">yeah just like stop it and she was like oh well he said I could have gone over last night and I was like if you'd actually gone over to his house last night I think I would have like actually gotten angry at you after everything he said</u>
<u n="137" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0439">and you were like okay I'll come over I said all you would have done is sat there and argued with each other</u>
<u n="139" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="140" who="S0439">you know it wouldn't have been a nice evening you know like <pause dur="short"/> she just wants it she just wants it to work and I don't like that's not a bad thing I'm not saying that wanting it to work is a bad thing but it's just it's not working you know?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0439">they hoped that going from like best friends to a grey zone was suddenly gonna be like the best thing ever but it just</u>
<u n="143" who="S0441">didn't work <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="144" who="S0439">yeah it just didn't turn out that way it wasn't they they weren't they're not compatible that's really sad but</u>
<u n="145" who="S0441">it takes quite a lot to realise that I think doesn't it?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0439">yeah <pause dur="short"/> because it's <pause dur="short"/> it's admitting to yourself that you're not what someone wants you know no one wants that no one wants to be <pause dur="short"/> like make you feel that they're not good enough but it's the it's not that she's not good enough for him she's just not the one who's gonna make him go head over heels you know?</u>

<u n="153" who="S0441">yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0439">and the moment she realises that <pause dur="short"/> she'll be a lot happier I think but</u>
<u n="155" who="S0441">unfortunately she's got to realise that on her own</u>
<u n="156" who="S0439"><trunc>exac</trunc> yeah I mean she like like I said to her I was like you know my opinion I'm not gonna tell you my opinion but at the moment you want you know you want me to you want advice just let me know like</u>
