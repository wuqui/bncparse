<u n="2" who="S0355">thank you so did you manage to download your other conversations?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0281">upload? yeah I did yeah mm but then I had to upload it to the</u>
<u n="4" who="S0355" trans="overlap">what's what's the difference between downloading and uploading?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0281">well downloading is when you get something from the internet and download it to your computer or</u>
<u n="6" who="S0355" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="7" who="S0281">whatever it is your phone or and uploading is when you've got you've produced something and you you give it to somebody else</u>
<u n="8" who="S0355">mm</u>
<u n="9" who="S0281">or put it up for somebody else</u>
<u n="10" who="S0355">okay</u>
<u n="11" who="S0281">but the problem I had was that when I did it before my well basically <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> told me how to do it and I wrote it down <pause dur="short"/> but when I got my new computer I found although I didn't realise at the time that the problem was that my phone was not synced or synchronised into my new computer so it was basically just a a question of going to a I think it was settings and just click on something that says synchronise your phone to this computer but the guy had spent two hours trying to figure it out how to do it and didn't didn't know that you know really he was supposed to be a computer expert but we spent all that afternoon you know a couple of hours over two hours trying to figure out how to do it and he downloaded <trunc>I</trunc>Itunes and all the rest of it which I didn't need and didn't want and then had to get rid of it so in the end so I went to Apple shop on the other day on Friday and he said yeah easy enough bom bom bom bom bom <pause dur="short"/> and then I came home and my phone was now synced is now synced to my computer and any any future times I just I put the recordings in and and I can <trunc>acc</trunc> them straight away access them straight away <pause dur="short"/> you know it's like most things isn't it? easy when you know how</u>
<u n="12" who="S0355">gosh</u>
<u n="13" who="S0281">mm</u>
<u n="14" who="S0355">so how many conversations have you recorded this week?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0281">none this month none that's why I want to get a couple done yeah <pause dur="long"/> and I only did a couple of small ones last month <pause dur="short"/> it's only twelve quid but better than nothing <pause dur="short"/> they said that they they planned to continue it on through two thousand and fifteen I thought they were going to finish it June maybe they haven't got enough? <pause dur="short"/> I'd have thought there'd be more people doing it than there are</u>
<u n="16" who="S0355">have you seen America's reaction to us joining the Chinese bank?</u>
<u n="17" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0355">what did you make of that?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0281">it sounds a bit like sour grapes you know that they're either miffed that they didn't do it or <pause dur="short"/> think it's it's not on to support you know because of the the special relationship we have with America we're not really supposed to do that kind of thing <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>cha</trunc> erm China called it childish <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but I think America's feeling increasing increasingly threatened by China <pause dur="short"/> not militarily but certainly economically indeed it's been predicted that by twenty thirty China will have overtaken America as the leading economic power in the world what do you think about it?</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<event desc="background talk"/>

<u n="201" who="S0355">as far as I'm aware yeah <pause dur="short"/> some people don't have that but she didn't talk to her sister for a long time she certainly didn't tell her she was dying so erm er her sister was a bit miffed and a bit peeved by her erm then <pause dur="long"/> hopefully she'll get over it <pause dur="short"/> so you know <pause dur="short"/> I don't know why was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> an alcoholic why did she get swept away on it you know what was that all about? sad isn't it?</u>
<u n="202" who="S0281">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> don't they reckon that some is? I suppose most of it's erm in your DNA that some people are more prone to doing whatever than others</u>
<u n="203" who="S0355">yes yes I mean brief</u>
<u n="204" who="S0281"><unclear/> and suddenly I mean to a greater extent</u>
<u n="205" who="S0355">even if they have a pretty</u>
<u n="206" who="S0281">after after that we had our fair share of pints and booze in general and yet we never got addicted to it</u>
<u n="207" who="S0355" trans="overlap">well there is that there is that <pause dur="short"/> I suppose in my life I have been addicted to booze at various times I remember waking up in the morning and thinking I have to drink erm but</u>
<u n="208" who="S0281">it's a psychological dependence when you start <unclear/></u>
<u n="209" who="S0355" trans="overlap">but I think cos certainly at the end of the day I would just go and have a beer <pause dur="short"/> and <unclear/> you know one beer leads to another I could never just have a beer and feel chilled I'd have to have I'd have to get pissed <pause dur="short"/> and I and at the end when I drank I used to go out by myself go to the pub drink by myself to get pissed and you realise how how miserable that was you see I see other people who are drinkers who go there to drink to get pissed and it's very it's sad very insular to do that isn't it? it's very <pause dur="short"/> so erm yeah so but thankfully I'm not er I don't do that anymore er but I have periods when I when I get pissed very occasionally <pause dur="short"/> think but that that's only happened once in the last years and years I didn't you know years and years and years so er no I agree that there are there are things in your in your genes that can influence that erm you know if that's what they tell us but I think that there are things that er I think there are also psychological reasons why we drink as well</u>
<u n="210" who="S0281">of course</u>
<u n="211" who="S0355">and I don't think it's only just the one thing I think it's and I think you know if you look at <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she went out with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> for a long time and you know I I he wasn't er he didn't treat women nicely erm so you think well she she accepted that but they did row they did have rows but she still went out with him being you know with his with his attitude and everything and I think well <vocal desc="laugh"/> she didn't have much self respect did she you know? erm neither did <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> but er you know so I think I think people <pause dur="short"/> I drank for a to try and get some self respect in in a crazy way I mean in and the madness of it is is you when you drink you <trunc>los</trunc> the more you lose your self respect <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="212" who="S0281">yeah</u>
<u n="213" who="S0355">it's madness isn't it? sort of weird psychology weird stuff</u>
