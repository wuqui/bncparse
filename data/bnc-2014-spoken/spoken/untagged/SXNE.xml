<u n="45" who="S0663">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0661">which was really over the top violence but that's what that's what he does and that's what he's very good at he's broken all these records for the most use of fake blood in films and stuff like that and</u>

<u n="1335" who="S0661">and then she got the train home and had repaired it and then by the morning the repair just failed so had to put a new inner tube in and <vocal desc="laugh"/> then she got another <trunc>pu</trunc>puncture in the new inner tube</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0663">no oh that's so disheartening isn't it when she makes such an effort? I mean you both</u>

<u n="1338" who="S0663">you're both very good at at cycling but even so</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0661" trans="overlap">when I took it out it was one of these cheap ones from Wilkos so I think maybe that's why cos it'd just it had this like loads of little holes along the end in it</u>
<u n="1340" who="S0663">oh</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0661">couldn't even repair it</u>

<u n="1345" who="S0661">today</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0662" whoConfidence="low">oh</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0663">I know but it's so it's disheartening isn't it? because I mean that's</u>

<u n="1353" who="S0662">yeah</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0663">you're spending your wages back in inner tubes and it kind of it's a bit counterproductive isn't it?</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0661" trans="overlap">well I had a couple of weeks <pause dur="short"/> last year where I must I must've had like nearly ten punctures</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0663"><vocal desc="sigh"/> oh</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0661">just I was = I was on the verge of giving up cycling it was <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="1362" who="S0662">yeah</u>
<u n="1363" who="S0661" trans="overlap">so annoying</u>
<u n="1364" who="S0663">well I would've done <unclear>coward</unclear></u>
<u n="1365" who="S0661" trans="overlap">I think it was just some shrapnel that was in <anon type="place"/> park that kept going anywhere</u>
<u n="1366" who="S0662">ah</u>
<u n="1367" who="S0661">but it's so it's hard when you're going that far to <trunc>j</trunc> keep</u>
<u n="1368" who="S0662">mm mm</u>
<u n="1369" who="S0661" trans="overlap">you know <unclear/> grounded</u>

<u n="1371" who="S0661" trans="overlap"><unclear>right</unclear></u>
<u n="1372" who="S0663">and and it's really important to be safe so</u>
<u n="1373" who="S0661">but my new bike's a bit <pause dur="short"/> a bit better because it's thinner tyres than my mountain bike which has flatter tyres so I think there's less chance of it actually hitting something</u>
<u n="1374" who="S0663" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1375" who="S0661">and the tyres are harder which I dunno maybe that makes them more resilient or maybe that makes them more resilient or maybe that <unclear>means er</unclear></u>

<u n="1390" who="S0662" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="1391" who="S0661">which means my arms are overstretched and I've got more weight of my backpack on my arms than I would have when I'm sat like that</u>

<u n="1393" who="S0661">or maybe the bike's too big for me and I'm stretching further than I should be</u>

<u n="1399" who="S0662" trans="overlap">I was gonna say tennis elbow mm</u>
<u n="1400" who="S0663">and then you'll end up with support straps unless you put the support straps on when you're cycling but I don't know if that will help</u>
<u n="1401" who="S0661">well it shouldn't it shouldn't happen I just need to fix whatever's going wrong but erm</u>
<u n="1402" who="S0663">so if you're not <unclear/> the suspension on your</u>
<u n="1403" who="S0662" trans="overlap">you'll have to keep your eye on it and see</u>
<u n="1404" who="S0663">no</u>

<u n="1413" who="S0661">that was very <trunc>s</trunc> very similar but made by a different company and they said what <trunc>si</trunc> what size do you want? and it was fifty-four centimetres on this one so I'll give you fifty-four centimetres on this one <pause dur="short"/> I was like yeah sounds good <pause dur="short"/> didn't test ride it erm but I don't when I test rode it I don't know what I'm should be feeling because it's so different and I'm not used to it</u>

<u n="1419" who="S0662" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1420" who="S0661">and when I looked at the size guides <pause dur="short"/> on the internet for the old bike and the new bike</u>
<u n="1421" who="S0663">yeah</u>
<u n="1422" who="S0661">they're both fifty-four centimetres so you think they're the same size but</u>
<u n="1423" who="S0662">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1424" who="S0661">I they're not because the frames are different shapes like different geometries</u>

<u n="1450" who="S0662">yeah</u>
<u n="1451" who="S0661">but I think there might be some options whether you can I <trunc>s</trunc> I've not actually had chance to look myself yet but maybe just pushing the seat forward or something or</u>

<u n="1453" who="S0662">yeah</u>
<u n="1454" who="S0661">moving the handlebars up or even replacing the drop bars with some flat bars might help</u>

<u n="1456" who="S0663">unlike I've done with mine well that I did a very very long time ago cos mine's a racing bike and and I had originally it came with drop handlebars but I've just had the standard handlebars put on it because</u>
