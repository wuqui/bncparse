<u n="1" who="S0084">it's so upsetting <pause dur="short"/> just leave it to fester love</u>
<u n="2" who="S0041">fester</u>
<u n="3" who="S0084">fester <pause dur="short"/> uncle Fester</u>
<u n="4" who="S0041">erm <pause dur="short"/> fork?</u>
<u n="5" who="S0084">to shovel the food?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0041">to shovel <pause dur="short"/> shovel the food</u>
<u n="7" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> genius <pause dur="short"/> is that your dinner? Oh the fish is in the oven</u>
<u n="8" who="S0041">no I've got the fish for next for second dinner <pause dur="short"/> so I'm going to have a slice of eggy bread for first dinner and then then it'll be time for second dinner which seems fine</u>
<u n="9" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mhm <pause dur="short"/> mm seems sensible</u>
<u n="10" who="S0041"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> at work likes to talk to me now</u>
<u n="11" who="S0084">yeah just tell that you hate her</u>
<u n="12" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> the thing is I think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> knows that I hate her</u>
<u n="13" who="S0084">right <pause dur="short"/> do you have a pained expression on your face every time she talks to you?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0041">yes <pause dur="short"/> erm but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I don't think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> likes her either <pause dur="short"/> I think it's just cos she's so tedious <pause dur="short"/> like it takes her so long to talk as well that you're just like oh fucking shut up <pause dur="short"/> but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s much more patient with her than I am</u>
<u n="15" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="16" who="S0041">so when we're both we both have to play the game of just nod and she might stop speaking soon and realise that she's the only one that's been talking in this conversation</u>
<u n="17" who="S0084">yeah those people never get the hint though do they?</u>
<u n="18" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="19" who="S0084">is she the older one that's got the kids? No</u>
<u n="20" who="S0041">no kids <pause dur="short"/> she's old though <pause dur="short"/> well not super old <pause dur="short"/> she's fifty this year</u>
<u n="21" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="22" who="S0041">well no you're thinking of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> I like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="23" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="24" who="S0041">she's on team Amy though</u>
<u n="25" who="S0084">oh</u>
<u n="26" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> oh my God <pause dur="short"/> amy <pause dur="short"/> let's speak about her</u>
<u n="27" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="28" who="S0041">has gone down to <pause dur="short"/> what has she gone down to? mm <pause dur="short"/> oh <pause dur="short"/> I don't remember the name of the place but we'll say it's <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> don't know</u>
<u n="29" who="S0084">somewhere west</u>
<u n="30" who="S0041">somewhere <pause dur="short"/> no it's just somewhere that I don't know of</u>
<u n="31" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="32" who="S0041">or like <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="33" who="S0084" trans="overlap">but you don't know <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> oh okay</u>
<u n="34" who="S0041">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> somewhere <pause dur="short"/> she's gone there cos their erm sales manager <pause dur="short"/> director of sales has just walked out and they've been one sales manager down for like eight weeks or something so they're really behind on their quotas <pause dur="short"/> so basically as a favour <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> has pimped her out to go and help them out for two weeks or something</u>
<u n="35" who="S0084" trans="overlap">right <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0041">erm I mean I'm the only person that knows that that's the part of her personal development plan to go and work in a cluster cos she just works for <pause dur="short"/> she's a sales manager for a hotel</u>
<u n="37" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0041">usually sales managers manage a couple of hotels so she's had a really easy ride of it</u>
<u n="39" who="S0084">oh that's interesting</u>
<u n="40" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm and obviously her targets are easy to get cos we do all the work and she just takes credit for it</u>
<u n="41" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> can't blame the girl for trying</u>
<u n="42" who="S0041">whereas <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> really she's been really smart about it because if you work for a cluster as opposed to just one hotel then you don't get to speak to the conference team and find out all the insider gossip and try and work around them <pause dur="short"/> you're just left to your own devices and the conference team won't talk to you because they don't won't you poaching their clients</u>
<u n="43" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> fine</u>
<u n="44" who="S0041">so that's how she's ended up being so good</u>
<u n="45" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0041">but she's basically passed it off to everyone else as if they've requested her to go and sort it out <pause dur="short"/> so she's looking after a cluster <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> what a douche</u>
<u n="47" who="S0084">she's a nob</u>
<u n="48" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="49" who="S0084">well at least that gets her out your hair for two weeks</u>
<u n="50" who="S0041">mm <pause dur="short"/> it just pisses me off hearing her say it because she's not particularly good at her job <pause dur="short"/> she just is getting on the back of everyone else</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0041">she's been in sales for a year and a half</u>
<u n="53" who="S0084">is that it? She's already a sales manager</u>
<u n="54" who="S0041">mhm <pause dur="short"/> that's what I mean <pause dur="short"/> had she not worked at our hotel she wouldn't have a chance</u>
<u n="55" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mhm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0041">her figures aren't high enough <pause dur="short"/> her contacts aren't high enough</u>
<u n="57" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0041">she's just been fortunate</u>
<u n="59" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah it is <pause dur="short"/> it basically is just <trunc>ri</trunc> right place right time <pause dur="short"/> and don't rock the boat too much</u>
<u n="60" who="S0041">mhm <pause dur="short"/> which I mean is great for her and if she's a nice person you'd be like fucking hell <pause dur="short"/> great</u>
<u n="61" who="S0084">yeah but it still doesn't seem fair though if you're the in a different department and that option isn't available to you and you're working your arse off for little credit</u>
<u n="62" who="S0041" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> so she's winning <pause dur="short"/> she basically gets targeted on bedrooms as well as conference <pause dur="short"/> but if she overhears me landing a big deal she muscles in</u>
<u n="63" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> really?</u>
<u n="64" who="S0041">and she's like that <pause dur="short"/> oh do you want me to contact them and ask them about Business Cub <pause dur="short"/> and I'm like no <pause dur="short"/> cos I know she's only doing it to make friends with them and then she'll make them one of her accounts <pause dur="short"/> mhm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0084">bitch</u>
<u n="66" who="S0041">I know</u>
<u n="67" who="S0084">there's no sense of like unity then is there</u>
<u n="68" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> no not at all <pause dur="short"/> and I mean I can't get angry because I don't have accounts that are my own so there's no benefit to me having them but I just resent her reigning the credit for just jumping on at the last minute</u>
<u n="69" who="S0084">yeah fair enough <pause dur="short"/> well it's it's it you're getting on with anyone that's not really pulling their weight you know if you're getting paid a decent salary or is getting credit for something that they isn't justified <pause dur="short"/> like isn't through hard work or their hard work <pause dur="short"/> somebody else's</u>
<u n="70" who="S0041" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> and she hasn't done a <pause dur="short"/> she did a  training like I did the first week I got there <pause dur="short"/> yet  have we got  have we got room for a conference on this day? And I'm thinking you should know how to check that yourself <pause dur="short"/> that's part of your job <pause dur="short"/> but she'll <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and I mid doing something and even Simon now says if you've got any enquires send it to the <trunc>i</trunc> in box</u>
<u n="71" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="72" who="S0041">and we'll get to it when I get to it <pause dur="short"/> we're busy now</u>
<u n="73" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="74" who="S0041">Cos she just says it <pause dur="short"/> she'll start speaking <pause dur="short"/> expect you to drop what you're doing and check availability for her when actually she should be able to check it for herself</u>
<u n="75" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0041">and we have to put contacts together for her when she should be able to do a contract herself <pause dur="short"/> it's a button <pause dur="short"/> it's just it's a tedious time consuming job</u>
<u n="77" who="S0084">she doesn't want to do it</u>
<u n="78" who="S0041">so she doesn't want to do it <pause dur="short"/> yeah we can't say no cos then we're cos we're reactive sales so she'll be supporting the sales team</u>
<u n="79" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> what a nober</u>
<u n="80" who="S0041">she's just doing it to be <pause dur="short"/> it it's just feels like whenever she does something it's to get something <pause dur="short"/> she never <pause dur="short"/> if we  if we  needed something she'd never help us but she expects our help all the time</u>
<u n="81" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0041">and that's another thing <pause dur="short"/> she dropped <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> in it</u>
<u n="83" who="S0084">yeah?</u>
<u n="84" who="S0041">Cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> the GM has started this new thing where he's saying <pause dur="short"/> he started like a secret club <pause dur="short"/> I don't really understand what the hell's going on</u>
<u n="85" who="S0084">what?</u>
<u n="86" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and there's a few people in the hotel basically that are working on this <trunc>il</trunc> on the PE team and I don't know what the hell that is <pause dur="short"/> but he's basically driving revenue within the hotel <pause dur="short"/> so both <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> cos she's Sales manager and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> because he's a financial controller to see if it's financially viable</u>
<u n="87" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0041">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> for some reason <pause dur="short"/> I don't know why <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s in on the game <pause dur="short"/> maybe because he's they're trying to develop him</u>
<u n="89" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0041">so <unclear/> proof that he can manage <pause dur="short"/> and they've been on this stupid team erm to drive revenue in the hotel</u>
<u n="91" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="92" who="S0041"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s not on the team but <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> did the usual and basically recruited loads of people to do the work for her <pause dur="short"/> one of them being <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> stupid enough to say yes I'll help <pause dur="short"/> and I did warn her</u>
<u n="93" who="S0084">she is a douche</u>
<u n="94" who="S0041">yeah and she said <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said no now I've just said I'll help with the restaurant lunches because that goes on our banqueting revenue so win win</u>
<u n="95" who="S0084" trans="overlap">okay</u>
<u n="96" who="S0041">so there's a big massive <pause dur="short"/> there's a big presentation tomorrow that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> are supposed to be doing to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> who is the regional sales director that's come in <pause dur="short"/> real big cheese <pause dur="short"/> as far as we're concerned he's the closest to head office that we ever see</u>
<u n="97" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so he's come in <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s fucked off and been pimped out and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s said that he's too he's he's too shy to do the presentation so <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> fell on <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="99" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="100" who="S0041"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s got to do a massive presentation tomorrow <pause dur="short"/> something that she's not been involved in <pause dur="short"/> doesn't have a clue and has literally got some slides <pause dur="short"/> and she was like what? And he's prepare him to ask you for questions about meetings <pause dur="short"/> and she's like what the fuck? Cos <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s fucked off and then <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> will come back and say well I don't know if I can help cos I wasn't in the last meeting</u>
<u n="101" who="S0084">oh what a nob</u>
<u n="102" who="S0041">yeah she's so  she's so  bad</u>
<u n="103" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="104" who="S0041">and it works for her career like being that type of person is great for sales</u>
<u n="105" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0041">Cos you pass the buck <pause dur="short"/> you don't have to do anything and you just reap the benefits so really she's doing really well</u>
<u n="107" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="108" who="S0041">but I just can't understand how you could be that awful <pause dur="short"/> that that selfish to you people your supposed to work with <pause dur="short"/> and so two faced</u>
<u n="109" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't feel like you're part of a team <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> you must think for them <pause dur="short"/> erm why do you get job satisfaction from that?</u>
<u n="110" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="111" who="S0084">you couldn't pay me enough <pause dur="short"/> I mean obviously that's why they pay people really well in sales cos I think money does turn you <pause dur="short"/> and some people who are only interested or only motivated by money then great then sales is for you but in terms of like your own emotional development I think it just stunts you because you've basically just got to be out there for yourself and you know to sell whatever it is that you your commodity or whatever it is against anybody else</u>
<u n="112" who="S0041" trans="overlap">yep <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> I'm er I'm not pro <pause dur="short"/> not pro that</u>

<u n="120" who="S0041">and you even if you could see it <pause dur="short"/> as long as it looks pretty</u>
<u n="121" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> we do need to go to Triumph <pause dur="short"/> do you want to do some birthday shopping on your birthday?</u>
