<u n="7" who="S0529" trans="overlap">no no I literally can't so what they'd have to do is they'd have to do what I did last year when I didn't have enough money and they just take it out of the bank like five pounds a month or something <pause dur="short"/> but my mum's taken on that from last year and she still has it like she's still paying five pounds a month</u>
<u n="8" who="S0530">really?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0529" trans="overlap">to pay off last year's money and I can't ask her to do it again</u>

<u n="29" who="S0529" trans="overlap">that's yeah yeah I'm still gonna have to pay for it I'm this isn't even like like cos some of the money you do pay back in twenty years whenever when you have enough money so there's that as well from <anon type="place"/> like the fees or something</u>

<u n="33" who="S0529" trans="overlap">more than that <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> but I don't know how much I've spent this term <pause dur="short"/> probably about a grand more than that? two grand I expect <pause dur="short"/> yeah cos how much was accommodation?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0530">accommodation <pause dur="long"/> I'm not sure <pause dur="short"/> the thing is if <trunc>y</trunc> I think if you leave potentially if you leave at Christmas you'd <trunc>ha</trunc> if you did choose to leave at Christmas then you'd have less to pay back because it's when you're it I think it's all timed when your loan instalments come in <pause dur="short"/> I had to pay a lot of money because I my next instalment had like literally just come in but obviously you get a new instalment in January don't you?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0529">mm</u>

<u n="45" who="S0529" trans="overlap">you know I still am a bit but I'm also wanting to you know <pause dur="short"/> I yeah it's just the options are a bit terrifying at the moment <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="46" who="S0530"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if how helpful this is but <trunc>li</trunc></u>
<u n="47" who="S0529" trans="overlap">you don't have to try and be helpful</u>
<u n="48" who="S0530" trans="overlap">no no</u>

<u n="54" who="S0530" trans="overlap">but <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0529">yeah I did think last night like would it really be terrible if I just stayed for three years and didn't enjoy myself and always struggled with the work but eventually did it after like a few extensions each time or whatever? cos I'd still have like people who are nice to <trunc>h</trunc> live with and I'd still have financial security and I'd still have like you know <pause dur="short"/> a place to <pause dur="short"/> act my age and not have to go into working yet and <vocal desc="sigh"/></u>

<u n="71" who="S0529">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I don't think I realised that last year when I went home like how different it would be</u>
<u n="72" who="S0530">because when <trunc>y</trunc> er I think when I dropped out last year the thing that hit me when I left uni <pause dur="short"/> I felt like <pause dur="short"/> imagine like being a spider on a web and then having that <trunc>r</trunc> that web like ripped from you you're just like you're just nothing</u>
