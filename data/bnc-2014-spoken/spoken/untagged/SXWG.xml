<u n="776" who="S0579" trans="overlap">I don't think we</u>
<u n="777" who="S0454">but there's always been a political rivalry between Madrid and Barcelona so</u>
<u n="778" who="S0579" trans="overlap">between er</u>
<u n="779" who="S0454">a lot of commentators wonder was it really about animals' rights or was this just a a way of getting at Madrid by saying well fine we're going to ban your favourite sport</u>
<u n="780" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yes <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>oh yes</unclear></u>
<u n="781" who="S0454">bit like the fox hunting I suppose in the UK that people who don't like the rich</u>
<u n="782" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh yes <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="783" who="S0454">and are perhaps envious of them deliberately object to fox hunting because</u>
<u n="784" who="S0579">yes</u>
<u n="785" who="S0454">let's face it only the the rich aristocrats can afford to go hunting cos who can afford to have a horse</u>
<u n="786" who="S0579" trans="overlap">who can afford it?</u>
<u n="787" who="S0454">and a pack of hounds except the the well off? so</u>
<u n="788" who="S0579" trans="overlap">I remember when we came here I don't suppose it does now but from the bedroom window upstairs you can watch the hounds</u>
<u n="789" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="790" who="S0579" trans="overlap">over the moor like</u>
<u n="791" who="S0454">yes well that's stopped now hasn't it? well not completely stopped but erm</u>
<u n="792" who="S0579" trans="overlap">er yes <pause dur="short"/> has it no has it stopped has it?</u>
<u n="793" who="S0454">well it's stopped in certain ways the the dogs aren't <trunc>al</trunc> er aren't allowed to tear the fox apart any more they're supposed to shoot the fox dead</u>
<u n="794" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no no <pause dur="short"/> no no</u>
<u n="795" who="S0454">I suppose in reality it's a bit difficult to police that isn't it? but anyway there's kind of rules about it</u>
<u n="796" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah in fact they used to meet in the village there</u>
<u n="797" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="798" who="S0579">yeah the horses and</u>
<u n="799" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yeah well it's quite a sight isn't it?</u>
<u n="800" who="S0579">yeah <unclear>all</unclear></u>
<u n="801" who="S0454" trans="overlap"><trunc>h</trunc> whatever you feel about fox hunting it's a lovely sight</u>
<u n="802" who="S0579" trans="overlap">all their stuff and their gowns and what were these jackets and</u>
<u n="803" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes those red jackets oh yes it's a really lovely sight</u>
<u n="804" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah and all those oh yeah they were <unclear/> very much <unclear>a part of that</unclear></u>
<u n="805" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you know I don't agree with fox hunting at all but</u>
<u n="806" who="S0579">no no</u>
<u n="807" who="S0454">it is quite a spectacle</u>
<u n="808" who="S0579">it is yeah no</u>
<u n="809" who="S0454">yes and it is traditional but I suppose the thing I question is you know farmers will say oh we have to keep fox numbers down but the reality is no one farms poultry</u>
<u n="810" who="S0579">no</u>
<u n="811" who="S0454">free range any more out here</u>
<u n="812" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no it's all under <unclear>the sheds</unclear></u>
<u n="813" who="S0454" trans="overlap">so if they've got poultry and they're in sheds</u>
<u n="814" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="815" who="S0454">and it's all locked down and you couldn't get in without a key and get through several you know it's all locked down isn't it? so a fox hasn't got a chance of getting in</u>
<u n="816" who="S0579" trans="overlap">well yes no I know cos I used to <trunc>r</trunc> well we used to have a company up in the <unclear/> near <anon type="place"/> somewhere where they had rows and rows of houses er you know for</u>
<u n="817" who="S0454" trans="overlap">oh yes for chickens</u>
<u n="818" who="S0579">chickens and stuff</u>
<u n="819" who="S0454">I find it quite unpleasant actually</u>
<u n="820" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh it's dreadful <unclear>I mean er</unclear> all all they're in there but it looks very much wrong</u>
<u n="821" who="S0454">yes yes I feel bad actually</u>
<u n="822" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="823" who="S0454">I'm I keep meaning to stop eating chicken cos I I actually think morally that's not right</u>
<u n="824" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="825" who="S0454">whereas you know beef that's in a field isn't it? so</u>
<u n="826" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="827" who="S0454">I don't have a problem with killing an animal but I mean its life shouldn't be miserable</u>
<u n="828" who="S0579">no no</u>
<u n="829" who="S0454" trans="overlap">it should have a a reasonable life and chickens obviously don't or pigs</u>
<u n="830" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="831" who="S0454">so today actually when I was ordering I did choose beef and that did cross my mind that</u>
<u n="832" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="833" who="S0454">I was tossing up between chicken and beef but</u>
<u n="834" who="S0579">of course it's better than it used to be because I remember in my younger days with with with these in the town they were I think at the time er there used to be blood floating under the er the gates there</u>
<u n="835" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="836" who="S0579">where they'd just been slaughtering them</u>
<u n="837" who="S0454">oh dear that's unpleasant</u>
<u n="838" who="S0579" trans="overlap">so you could see the blood floating underneath</u>
<u n="839" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="840" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="841" who="S0454">in the supermarkets you can buy free range meat quite easily now in all the big supermarkets</u>
<u n="842" who="S0579">can you?</u>
<u n="843" who="S0454">yeah it's expensive though it's about five times the price</u>
<u n="844" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="845" who="S0454">but I mean that's really what I should do just buy beef and lamb because that's always free range isn't it? if they're always in the fields that's fine so just buy normal beef and lamb</u>
<u n="846" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yes mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="847" who="S0454">and then if I want chicken I should probably just buy the free range one once in a blue moon</u>
<u n="848" who="S0579">oh yes</u>
<u n="849" who="S0454">the other things is they fill those factory chickens with chemicals and antibiotics cos otherwise they'd all get sick cos they they're too close</u>
<u n="850" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="851" who="S0454">so you're ingesting all those chemicals which is not</u>
<u n="852" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh dear</u>
<u n="853" who="S0454">not particularly what you want to be doing with your health is it?</u>
<u n="854" who="S0579" trans="overlap">no I know also of course in farming days you know <trunc>b</trunc> going back seventy years ago when we were <unclear>in South Africa with</unclear> some farmers the men would be out in the fields doing whatever they had to ploughing up or whatever and the ladies would always be looking after the chickens and they kept the money</u>
<u n="855" who="S0454">oh right yes</u>
<u n="856" who="S0579"><unclear/> they yeah</u>
<u n="857" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes that's interesting isn't it?</u>
<u n="858" who="S0579">and so they looked after <trunc>th</trunc> and they used to look after them well</u>
<u n="859" who="S0454">mm</u>
<u n="860" who="S0579">and feed them pay for the food but then they kept the money</u>
<u n="861" who="S0454">yes that's quite interesting so that's the reverse of what we think happens</u>
<u n="862" who="S0579" trans="overlap">mm yeah mm yeah yeah that's right</u>
<u n="863" who="S0454" trans="overlap">that it was actually the woman who held on to the purse strings for <trunc>l</trunc> in farming families</u>
<u n="864" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><trunc>i</trunc> that that's right yeah <unclear>were they?</unclear></u>
<u n="865" who="S0454">it probably only changed with industrialisation where the men were given the wages directly by the factory owner</u>
<u n="866" who="S0579" trans="overlap">oh probably <pause dur="short"/> yes yeah</u>
<u n="867" who="S0454">and then that money went down the pub and</u>
<u n="868" who="S0579">yes <unclear>sort of got away</unclear></u>
<u n="869" who="S0454" trans="overlap">you know half of it never got home did it?</u>
<u n="870" who="S0579">no no no that's right</u>
<u n="871" who="S0454">but that's not actually what traditionally happened</u>
<u n="872" who="S0579">I know we used to have we used to have some farmers <unclear>actually</unclear> bit like that and er what happened er? well the farmers used to work very hard</u>
<u n="873" who="S0454">they do work <trunc>har</trunc> I think they still work very hard</u>
<u n="874" who="S0579" trans="overlap">and then he got very cross cos one of his daughters thought that he they worked the mothers too hard like</u>
<u n="875" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="876" who="S0579">and so I think one of the daughters took his wife off to Canada for about three months so <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="877" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="878" who="S0579">he didn't like that at all</u>
<u n="879" who="S0454">no I can imagine</u>
<u n="880" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> but er yes</u>
<u n="881" who="S0454">but they do work very hard on farms</u>
<u n="882" who="S0579">oh yes they</u>
<u n="883" who="S0454">there's an enormous suicide rate as well among farmers</u>
<u n="884" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="885" who="S0454">even today</u>
<u n="886" who="S0579">that's right</u>
<u n="887" who="S0454">although I don't know if that's because the job's really hard or if it's just because they're alone too much</u>
<u n="888" who="S0579">yes right</u>
<u n="889" who="S0454">and you see that's probably sadly</u>
<u n="890" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="891" who="S0454">a result of industrialisation in farming isn't it?</u>
<u n="892" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="893" who="S0454">before</u>
<u n="894" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="895" who="S0454">most jobs on the farm would be in a team you know if you needed to plough a field it wouldn't be one man on his own</u>
<u n="896" who="S0579">no</u>
<u n="897" who="S0454">but it'd be a team of farmers who might club together and you do</u>
<u n="898" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="899" who="S0454">Joe's farm one day and then next week you go to Bob's farm and you all help there</u>
<u n="900" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="901" who="S0454">because you needed a few people to to get jobs done whereas now it's one man on his own isn't it?</u>
<u n="902" who="S0579">well I met one of the farmers <unclear>can't remember</unclear> forgotten who he was now erm er <pause dur="short"/> it was when we lived in <anon type="place"/> I suppose sort of farmer somewhere he had acres and acres of fields to look after</u>
<u n="903" who="S0454" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="904" who="S0579">er and he was a very hard working bloke</u>
<u n="905" who="S0454">they are very hard working</u>
<u n="906" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="907" who="S0454">yes</u>
<u n="908" who="S0579">but I spoke to him <unclear/> I well I remember him once he gave me a lift into <anon type="place"/> I suppose was in the back cos in the boot he had a he had a sheep</u>
<u n="909" who="S0454">oh right</u>
<u n="910" who="S0579">still alive <vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/></u>
<u n="911" who="S0454">I heard quite an interesting comment about farming in the UK the other day</u>
<u n="912" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="913" who="S0454">which I thought was probably true it was in a book and I forget who wrote it</u>
<u n="914" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="915" who="S0454">something beginning with T Truss I think but he was saying the UK has never been interested in maximising yield they've been interested in <trunc>in</trunc> er in maximising economic output which of course is not the same thing is it?</u>
<u n="916" who="S0579" trans="overlap">that's it no no no</u>
<u n="917" who="S0454">so you could grow something like</u>
<u n="918" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="919" who="S0454">you know a high value crop</u>
<u n="920" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="921" who="S0454">which doesn't produce very much and you can make a lot of money off that but it wouldn't actually feed very many people</u>
<u n="922" who="S0579" trans="overlap"><unclear>no</unclear></u>
<u n="923" who="S0454">I thought well that's probably true because this country is different to most countries in Europe</u>
<u n="924" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yes well yes</u>
<u n="925" who="S0454">because a very small minority of people own the vast majority of land like</u>
<u n="926" who="S0579">yeah</u>
<u n="927" who="S0454">you know the royal family for example</u>
<u n="928" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="929" who="S0454">own huge swathes of the south west don't they? I think prince er Charles duchy of Cornwall</u>
<u n="930" who="S0579" trans="overlap">yeah all down Cornwall they <unclear/> don't they?</u>
<u n="931" who="S0454" trans="overlap">er and it's enormous amounts</u>
<u n="932" who="S0579">yeah</u>
