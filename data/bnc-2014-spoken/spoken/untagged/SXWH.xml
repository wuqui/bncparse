<u n="251" who="S0041">but I was thinking I might've done it in seventeen minutes you know <pause dur="short"/> cos that's two minutes over my well a minute and a half over my best time <pause dur="short"/> which seems extreme <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="252" who="S0084">but not <unclear/></u>
<u n="253" who="S0041">when I on the treadmill</u>
<u n="254" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="255" who="S0041">I start off pretty slow <pause dur="short"/> cos I control my breathing whereas here I got nought point five miles <pause dur="short"/> cos I remembered where it was where I first had to stop</u>
<u n="256" who="S0084">mhm</u>
<u n="257" who="S0041">and clocked the road <pause dur="short"/> and I got back and went on Google and I'd only gone nought point five miles before I was out of breath</u>
<u n="258" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="259" who="S0041">so maybe I just hammered it a bit too much <pause dur="short"/> but I just can't control it</u>
<u n="260" who="S0084">it's more  it's more  difficult to do that isn't it</u>
<u n="261" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="262" who="S0084">it is  it is  tougher I think when you're outdoors</u>
<u n="263" who="S0041">so but it's fine <pause dur="short"/> I'm just gonna keep going <pause dur="short"/> and keep trying until I get to the time where I go round and I don't have to stop</u>
<u n="264" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> well yeah</u>
<u n="265" who="S0041">it'll get that</u>
<u n="266" who="S0084">and that's all you can do <pause dur="short"/> and you're but the thing is the good thing is about it doing it regularly is you do see an improvement <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="267" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="268" who="S0084">you have done</u>
<u n="269" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="270" who="S0084">you've been running</u>
<u n="271" who="S0041">and a plus as well is that that's two miles <pause dur="short"/> and when I go for the two day thing it's still only gonna be one point five</u>
<u n="272" who="S0084">nice</u>
<u n="273" who="S0041">well it's  well it's  two point two but I walk down the street so we'll say two miles</u>
<u n="274" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="275" who="S0041">so at least I'll I'll <trunc>c</trunc> have an idea in my head of</u>
<u n="276" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="277" who="S0041">the the distance</u>
<u n="278" who="S0084">is that what they're gonna make you do? Are you gonna run outside or on the treadmill?</u>
<u n="279" who="S0041">when I do my fitness test?</u>
<u n="280" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0041">my first one that'll just be in the on the treadmill <pause dur="short"/> fine</u>
<u n="282" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="283" who="S0041">job's a good 'un <pause dur="short"/> but then when I go down for the two-day death</u>
<u n="284" who="S0084">two-day death</u>
<u n="285" who="S0041">which er obviously is its official name <pause dur="short"/> two-day death</u>
<u n="286" who="S0084">as it's known in the business</u>
<u n="287" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it will be outside in a massive group of people including lads and like eighteen-year-olds</u>
<u n="288" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="289" who="S0041">that are gonna ace it</u>
<u n="290" who="S0084">hmm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="291" who="S0041">and the thing that I don't get is they give you that table of the different age brackets</u>
<u n="292" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="293" who="S0041">if you're over twenty-six you can't apply <pause dur="short"/> so what they're giving me times for forty-year-olds for I don't know</u>
<u n="294" who="S0084">is that  is that  not that's for officers then? It's not for for ratings?</u>
<u n="295" who="S0041">it's for everybody <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="296" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so if you you can be any age and um apply to go on ratings can't you?</u>
<u n="297" who="S0041">no <pause dur="short"/> don't think so</u>
<u n="298" who="S0084">I thought it was just officers who had to be under twenty-six</u>
<u n="299" who="S0041">oh <pause dur="short"/> maybe</u>
<u n="300" who="S0084">I dunno</u>
<u n="301" who="S0041">my friend <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was saying he was looking to join and then he didn't cos he was too old <pause dur="short"/> and he's twenty-eight so</u>
<u n="302" who="S0084">has he got a degree?</u>
<u n="303" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> ah <pause dur="short"/> maybe that's why</u>
<u n="304" who="S0084"><vocal desc="yawn"/> I think it's officers there's a cut off <pause dur="short"/> but I think if you're any old cannon fodder they'll take you</u>
<u n="305" who="S0041">that's probably quite probably true</u>
<u n="306" who="S0084">and what you've gotta remember about all those eighteen-year-olds that you see they are the cannon fodder</u>
<u n="307" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="308" who="S0084">and they're not the ones who've got the brain cells <pause dur="short"/> so they might look fit <pause dur="short"/> they might run quite quickly <pause dur="short"/> but they'll you know</u>
<u n="309" who="S0041">that's it</u>
<u n="310" who="S0084">that's it <pause dur="short"/> game over <pause dur="short"/> that's all they've got to contribute</u>
<u n="311" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="312" who="S0084">can be thick as two short planks</u>
<u n="313" who="S0041">I mean I was thinking about it logically <pause dur="short"/> and if you got there with a really positive attitude <pause dur="short"/> really give it everything</u>
<u n="314" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="315" who="S0041">even if you're not quite cutting the mustard or you're coming bottom of the class they want to see that you're a that you're a really motivated determinate person</u>
<u n="316" who="S0084">that you're passionate about it <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> rather than Superman</u>
<u n="318" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> or that you're just gonna give up <pause dur="short"/> oh well I can't do it</u>
<u n="319" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="320" who="S0084">you know <pause dur="short"/> you're trying</u>
<u n="321" who="S0041">so you know even if  even if  I go there and I struggle as long as I throw myself into it</u>
<u n="322" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="323" who="S0041">full for two days then</u>
<u n="324" who="S0084">that's all they can ask for</u>
<u n="325" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="326" who="S0084"><unclear/></u>
<u n="327" who="S0041">Cos they say that you know you don't have to be super super fit <pause dur="short"/> cos once you're here once you start your training that's what we're here to do</u>
<u n="328" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="329" who="S0041">and I watched this video on their their training</u>
<u n="330" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="331" who="S0041">and the guy said you know when when people come here some people really struggle <pause dur="short"/> and it's fine <pause dur="short"/> cos it's not about a pass or fail <pause dur="short"/> ten ten week course</u>
<u n="332" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="333" who="S0041">it's our job to get you fit no matter what level you're at</u>
<u n="334" who="S0084">oh <pause dur="short"/> see that there you go <pause dur="short"/> well that's quite encouraging then</u>
<u n="335" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so they weren't they were basically saying like if you're not fit enough we've not done our job properly</u>
<u n="336" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="337" who="S0041">if you're by the twelve weeks by the end of the twelve weeks if you're not fit enough it's our problem</u>
<u n="338" who="S0084">nice <pause dur="short"/> that's well that's the attitude</u>
<u n="339" who="S0041">so</u>
<u n="340" who="S0084">I think I told you wasn't it my driving instructor was like that</u>
<u n="341" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0084">he really felt responsible for the people he was teaching <pause dur="short"/> he really felt like if they weren't getting it it was his fault because it meant that he wasn't teaching them correctly <pause dur="short"/> it meant that he wasn't teaching them so that they could understand <pause dur="short"/> cos once you've got a teacher who explains something you're like well why don't you just say it like that in the first place?</u>
<u n="343" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0084">it's really clear now <pause dur="short"/> bosh bosh bosh <pause dur="short"/> so yeah I mean really if you are gonna teach then that's really</u>
<u n="345" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="346" who="S0084">that's really the attitude you should have</u>
<u n="347" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="348" who="S0084">and that and that's encouraging as well <pause dur="short"/> cos it means that it's not like a a hard and fast rule <pause dur="short"/> like you are to do</u>
<u n="349" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0084">this or you're out <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="351" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="352" who="S0084">they'll take a lot of things into consideration <pause dur="short"/> which I guess is why you have so many hoops to jump through <pause dur="short"/> they'll take it all into account</u>
<u n="353" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="354" who="S0084">which is quite good in a way</u>
<u n="355" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it is quite good <pause dur="short"/> cos I was saying to my dad like when I go down there at least the thing that I struggle with is the fitness <pause dur="short"/> which is something that you're able to coach yourself to do</u>
<u n="356" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="357" who="S0041">whereas people that find it difficult to think strategically</u>
<u n="358" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="359" who="S0041">it it must be difficult to to teach yourself that <pause dur="short"/> I'm I'm sure that must be a skill that either are good at or you're not good at</u>
<u n="360" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="361" who="S0041">unless you can find someone to give you er problems to work  to work  through</u>
<u n="362" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="363" who="S0041">whereas at least that bit I know I can already do</u>
<u n="364" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="365" who="S0041">and the fitness thing's something quite hands-on that you can physically kinda change</u>
<u n="366" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="367" who="S0041">so I'd rather</u>
<u n="368" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="369" who="S0041">just have that to worry about than</u>
<u n="370" who="S0084">yeah that's something you can quite easily remedy in those ten weeks because you're gonna be doing you'll be working out every single day</u>
<u n="371" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="372" who="S0084">it's gonna be a fucking killer</u>
<u n="373" who="S0041">ain't it gonna be a killer</u>
<u n="374" who="S0084">but you are gonna be a machine <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> really</u>
<u n="375" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I am really excited for the end of it</u>
