<u n="70" who="S0589">maybe they're joining it all up</u>
<u n="71" who="S0588">well <trunc>tha</trunc> or knock it down <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> it won't be there any more except for the very front façade</u>
<u n="72" who="S0589">I don't know what's behind other than the other than the main building <pause dur="short"/> the erm the gym part is just like in a concrete and corrugated iron building</u>
<u n="73" who="S0588">right so not</u>
<u n="74" who="S0589" trans="overlap">corrugated steel</u>
<u n="75" who="S0588">the old <trunc>buil</trunc> but they're talking about a really rundown gym did you think it was really run down?</u>

<u n="77" who="S0588">yeah cos they're gonna that's what they're I mean there might be good things that would come out of it that's what they're hoping to improve <pause dur="short"/> but so there's the library which is a very nice building though so all that's gonna go at the side there but you'd have the front <unclear>but yeah</unclear> I don't know maybe it's a good thing but I'm just keeping you informed <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="78" who="S0589" trans="overlap">well yes</u>

<u n="83" who="S0588">but they're voting on it on Wednesday so our chance is <vocal desc="sigh"/> this week really or now I mean and <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> also but there's a chance it could get listed by English Heritage <pause dur="short"/> which would save it as well if it becomes a listed building</u>
<u n="84" who="S0589" trans="overlap">wow it would be cool though to have a contemporary gym and leisure centre there</u>
<u n="85" who="S0588">I've not read all those but there's not enough information about what's actually going to be in it it just depends if they've actually what's in the thing? I mean yeah but if you think in thirty years' time are we gonna still like the building? or are we gonna wish to have the old building back? cos they don't really age very well do they? the older buildings Victorian and Georgian buildings age very well well they all look lovely don't they? I'm not just being nostalgic</u>
<u n="86" who="S0589" trans="overlap">oh look I know that building</u>

<u n="93" who="S0588" trans="overlap">but there's no windows in it</u>
<u n="94" who="S0589">no they just had to legally preserve that bit so that's what they did</u>
<u n="95" who="S0588">why didn't they put windows in it though?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0589" trans="overlap">it's just by erm it's in <anon type="place"/> well <trunc>th</trunc>they don't need to it's not part of the actual construction</u>
<u n="97" who="S0588" trans="overlap">the building that's weird</u>
