<u n="69" who="S0475" trans="overlap">er</u>
<u n="70" who="S0417">it's not that <trunc>hel</trunc> there's a couple of things in there that are a little bit helpful but they're</u>

<u n="72" who="S0417">there's er bits in there about how people are coping with school or later on</u>
<u n="73" who="S0475" trans="overlap">right yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0417" trans="overlap">because that's what I find most interesting that how some of them were saying that they were having real problems with the school because they were erm labelling them as erm like lazy or all sorts of other things because they were doing stuff that</u>
<u n="75" who="S0475" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0417" trans="overlap">they already knew or</u>
<u n="77" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm mm mm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0417" trans="overlap">they would gaze out the window or they're one of them had their kids chucked out because they didn't or but then</u>
<u n="79" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0417">other kids have said their schools other people have said they've said nothing to the school and that they've picked up on it and they've been fine and other people have said</u>
<u n="81" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="82" who="S0417" trans="overlap">that they've said something and they thought they were a precocious parent who were like picking up their <trunc>chi</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> so there's interesting but there's not</u>
<u n="83" who="S0475">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0417">like a really</u>
<u n="85" who="S0475">normal schools deal with normality</u>
<u n="86" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="87" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm and if you get as there are quite a few of them around erm teachers who actually go with the kid you know</u>
<u n="88" who="S0417">mm</u>
<u n="89" who="S0475" trans="overlap">who can actually especially in the infant bit</u>
<u n="90" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="91" who="S0475">erm who can go with how how how they are learning how they are doing it erm what they can't really cope with are children who are too destructive in class</u>
<u n="92" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="93" who="S0475">erm but erm they because you can't really you can't stop everything erm there's got to be a certain conformity erm like</u>
<u n="94" who="S0417">yeah <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> was probably more destructive <unclear/></u>
<u n="95" who="S0475">mm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="96" who="S0417"><vocal desc="laugh"/> but we haven't talked about schools yet but I don't well one day cos even the preschool would start probably bringing in if it was if it was the Irish-speaking schools he's the other schools aren't very aren't that great</u>
<u n="97" who="S0475">right</u>
<u n="98" who="S0417" trans="overlap">so everybody sends their kids to the Irish-<trunc>spea</trunc> and they and they do it from the word go</u>
<u n="99" who="S0475">right right</u>
<u n="100" who="S0417" trans="overlap">speaking Irish I thought <trunc>w</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> he might only just be okay about talking <vocal desc="laugh"/> and talking isn't his strong point</u>
<u n="101" who="S0475">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0417" trans="overlap">and if he had to learn that all again</u>
<u n="103" who="S0475" trans="overlap">so would <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> be going to an Irish-speaking school?</u>
<u n="104" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0475">right right erm er how how do you sort of feel about</u>
<u n="106" who="S0417">well I think</u>
<u n="107" who="S0475" trans="overlap">for for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you know?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0417">yeah for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="109" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0417">I'm not sure that that would be that great for <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> but I don't think the English-speaking schools would be</u>
<u n="111" who="S0475">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0417">as good because they're not they will everyone sends their kids all the bright kids end up going to the Irish-speaking schools all the</u>
<u n="113" who="S0475" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="114" who="S0417" trans="overlap">best teachers go there all the best</u>
<u n="115" who="S0475" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="116" who="S0417" trans="overlap">kind of</u>
<u n="117" who="S0475" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="118" who="S0417"><unclear/> but they erm I also think it's not great for the kids who are good at erm <pause dur="short"/> sciences or not like in <trunc>l</trunc> you know for kids more the language side and I think he's more the maths and science side anyway</u>
<u n="119" who="S0475" trans="overlap">yes mm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0417" trans="overlap">he will will be I think</u>
<u n="121" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0417">possibly and then all the textbooks are erm are in Irish and they're not not as good I don't think as the other ones</u>
<u n="123" who="S0475">right</u>
<u n="124" who="S0417">erm especially the science ones <pause dur="short"/> erm but the the other the only other options are there aren't any other options around <anon type="place"/> really that <pause dur="short"/> so I don't know I really don't know</u>
<u n="125" who="S0475">it is a hard one that</u>
<u n="126" who="S0417" trans="overlap">it is a <trunc>har</trunc> it's a hard one</u>
<u n="127" who="S0475" trans="overlap">it is a hard one because erm certainly at the infant stage erm erm he wouldn't be learning to read in English you know</u>
<u n="128" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0475">he'd be learning to read in Irish</u>
<u n="130" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0475"><vocal desc="cough"/> so it's it's it's because <pause dur="short"/> mm and if he were er in anywhere in Britain</u>
<u n="132" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0475" trans="overlap">erm the erm say oh well at infant stage as long as it's a kindly school and it's not too</u>
<u n="134" who="S0417" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0475" trans="overlap">bad erm you can go to it because erm the child will pick up stuff</u>
<u n="136" who="S0417">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0475">erm the er but when they're actually learning to read in Irish that's a bit more difficult</u>
<u n="138" who="S0417">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0475" trans="overlap">because erm later on they'll get English lessons but I mean</u>
<u n="140" who="S0417" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0475" trans="overlap">do do erm for instance <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s girls can they read in English?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0417">yeah but you see er I don't think it did <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> many favours</u>
<u n="143" who="S0475">right</u>
<u n="144" who="S0417" trans="overlap">I think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had difficulties and she wasn't actually reading until she was seven or eight</u>
<u n="145" who="S0475">right</u>
<u n="146" who="S0417">and she got referred to a specialist erm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0475">was that reading in Irish? or it's just reading?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0417">just reading generally</u>
<u n="149" who="S0475">mm right yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0417">and <trunc>th</trunc> when she reads at home she reads in English books and that kind of thing so I think</u>
<u n="151" who="S0475">uhu</u>
<u n="152" who="S0417">if you've got some if you've got something that's erm mm not as easy for you er <pause dur="short"/> communicating or whatever in different ways</u>
<u n="153" who="S0475" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="154" who="S0417">then erm having to learn another language on top of it is I dunno it's pretty difficult</u>
<u n="155" who="S0475">so would the non-Irish schools in <anon type="place"/> which are not maybe very good at the infant level <pause dur="short"/> be okay?</u>
<u n="156" who="S0417">but then he would wouldn't be able to you can't</u>
<u n="157" who="S0475" trans="overlap">you can't transfer</u>
<u n="158" who="S0417">transfer because erm they they would all be</u>
<u n="159" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="160" who="S0417">speaking fluent Gaelic in <trunc>scho</trunc> and everything is</u>
<u n="161" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0417">once you go in there they say hello in in Irish everything you have to do in Irish</u>
<u n="163" who="S0475">right right</u>
<u n="164" who="S0417" trans="overlap">and once you're behind that's it you can't join again</u>
<u n="165" who="S0475" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="166" who="S0417">and the the other streams just aren't aren't as great even with <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> even though I was definitely considering him to go to the school here</u>
<u n="167" who="S0475">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0417">but it was the English side but because you've got no other kids who are erm or very few other kids who er er who are academic really it's it's <trunc>ba</trunc> erm it's nobody really talks about this but it's all <vocal desc="laugh"/> anyone who's</u>
<u n="169" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0417">got parents who are in any way bright or academic</u>
<u n="171" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="172" who="S0417" trans="overlap">they they'll if they've got a good Gaelic school they they all send them there so they the other lessons though they've got to cater for the majority of the class haven't you? so</u>
<u n="173" who="S0475" trans="overlap">yeah of course of course and er</u>
<u n="174" who="S0417" trans="overlap">so then he'll be relegated to classes where</u>
<u n="175" who="S0475" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0417">if he's a bright boy that'll be they would just won't be</u>

<u n="179" who="S0475" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="180" who="S0417" trans="overlap">for a long time I mean that that will be quite hard for him too and also just your mates and that kind of thing your mates are more the ones they love the you know they have the mucking around or the</u>
<u n="181" who="S0475" trans="overlap">you know to talk to them</u>
