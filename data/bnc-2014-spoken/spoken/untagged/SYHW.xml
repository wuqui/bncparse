<u n="509" who="S0012">eighty-odd houses is no good because it's just gonna all as they say it's gonna overrun the doctor's and and the school because the school isn't built for it</u>
<u n="510" who="S0152">yeah but the problem is we have there aren't that many children in <anon type="place"/> at the moment of that school age</u>
<u n="511" who="S0012">no?</u>
<u n="512" who="S0013">but they</u>

<u n="515" who="S0013" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="516" who="S0152">so the the effects of not having cos if you think about it the village hasn't got that many young people in it</u>

<u n="543" who="S0152">I would say that you would have the only erm this is thinking about what's happened at <anon type="place"/> and places like that is that people won't be they'll build the houses and people won't be able to get the mortgages</u>
<u n="544" who="S0012">no they won't will they?</u>
<u n="545" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah no</u>

<u n="590" who="S0012">but then as as a as a good way into the</u>

<u n="595" who="S0152">cos they actually strengthened the bridge there</u>
<u n="596" who="S0012">yeah and another thing is the new waterworks they're putting up that's going to supply <trunc>lo</trunc> that's going to supply loads of people have you seen it?

<u n="599" who="S0152">yeah</u>
