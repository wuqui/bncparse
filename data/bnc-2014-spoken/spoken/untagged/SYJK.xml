<u n="733" who="S0622">mm</u>
<u n="734" who="S0525">but you either have erm er a vehicle like a they call them HIAB vehicles which have cranes on the back of them so they can offload them but they're very expensive so you don't just transport pipe generally on HIABs you transport it on flat-back wagons which are cheaper</u>
<u n="735" who="S0622">yeah</u>
<u n="736" who="S0525">especially with a job like this where you've got loads and loads going in</u>
<u n="737" who="S0622">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="738" who="S0525" trans="overlap">if you've just got four pipes you'd have a HIAB and it would do it all</u>
<u n="739" who="S0622">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="740" who="S0525">but for this you'd have your flat-backs and they'd go in and you'd have a crane offload vehicle and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s very much into these erm <vocal desc="misc"/> suction cranes they're good cranes they've got like big suction pads like two suction pads</u>
<u n="741" who="S0622">mm</u>
<u n="742" who="S0525" trans="overlap">and go <vocal desc="misc"/> and they suck the pipe up so even though it's like four tons the piece of pipe these two suction pads will hold it and they drop it</u>
<u n="743" who="S0622" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="744" who="S0525">so you haven't got to lasso ropes around the end of it</u>
<u n="745" who="S0622">right okay</u>
<u n="746" who="S0525">and do all that you've just gotta drop the suction pads on and er so they're much quicker but they just break down all the time but a lot of companies now have them</u>
<u n="747" who="S0622"><vocal desc="cough"/></u>
<u n="748" who="S0525">especially the big contractors you know er erm <trunc>th</trunc>that that's what they have they have these pipes but of course once that's broken and then the pipe doesn't unload and then you if you're on-site as the guy for <anon type="place"/> you'll need to record exactly how long that wagon sits around doing nothing cos you generally get two hours to offload a wagon</u>
<u n="749" who="S0622">right yeah</u>
<u n="750" who="S0525">anything after two hours they call it demurrage</u>
<u n="751" who="S0622">right</u>
<u n="752" who="S0525">and you're into a demurrage charge and they'll charge that by the hour or</u>

<u n="756" who="S0525">by the hour or by the half hour</u>
<u n="757" who="S0622" trans="overlap">cos they're having to wait <unclear>yeah</unclear></u>
<u n="758" who="S0525">yeah so er demurrage means waiting time</u>
<u n="759" who="S0622">mm</u>
<u n="760" who="S0525">so you'd need to clock cos they they go oh you were waiting six hours you're <trunc>goi</trunc> you were waiting two and a half hours <trunc>y</trunc>you know so you you you've gotta clock those type of things as well</u>
<u n="761" who="S0622"><unclear>yeah</unclear> yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="762" who="S0525">to make sure they're not clocking that up because they they do that all the time</u>
<u n="763" who="S0622">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="764" who="S0525">you need to get the driver to give you some sort of confirmation as well when he leaves get times</u>
<u n="765" who="S0622"><unclear>oh right okay</unclear></u>
<u n="766" who="S0525">because all that helps with all the extra charges cos all those charges come in to us and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> never passes them on</u>
<u n="767" who="S0622">no no does he pay em then without question?</u>

<u n="863" who="S0622">you can just <trunc>trans</trunc>transpose it onto a</u>
<u n="864" who="S0525" trans="overlap">because the the delivery note's the delivery note's you you still wanna write a delivery note</u>
<u n="865" who="S0622">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="866" who="S0525">okay? so you wanna go erm so if you've got the pipe numbers what so if you've if you've got your delivery note and you write your four pipe numbers your delivery note's got a unique number on it</u>
<u n="867" who="S0622">mm</u>
<u n="868" who="S0525">okay? and a date so but it's but you'll you'll have several with the same dates but it's got a unique number the delivery note</u>
<u n="869" who="S0622">right</u>
<u n="870" who="S0525">there's only one with that number on it zero five six two or whatever</u>
<u n="871" who="S0622" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="872" who="S0525">erm so if you're not sure of them any numbers on it you take a <trunc>num</trunc> you take a photo of the pipe and on your phone and you call it zero five six two or whatever that delivery note number</u>
<u n="873" who="S0622" trans="overlap">delivery note yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="874" who="S0525">so and then somebody else can make their mind up what they think of it</u>
<u n="875" who="S0622">yes yeah</u>
<u n="876" who="S0525">I think I'd just take a photo for your backup to say</u>
<u n="877" who="S0622">yes yes mm</u>
<u n="878" who="S0525" trans="overlap">these are my pipe numbers and and call them all that delivery note number</u>

<u n="883" who="S0622" trans="overlap">yes yeah</u>
<u n="884" who="S0525">take photos like that but you know there's er <vocal desc="sigh"/> well I say there's there's no need it it was I would be amazed if if there's anybody there now because I'm not there actually recording pipe numbers and checking for duplicates</u>
<u n="885" who="S0622" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah</u>
<u n="886" who="S0525">none of them can work the spreadsheet so</u>
<u n="887" who="S0622">no no</u>
<u n="888" who="S0525">but I used to do that I used to get the delivery notes in from <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> write down their numbers</u>
<u n="889" who="S0622">yeah</u>
<u n="890" who="S0525">and at the end of every couple of days do a sort where you think woah <vocal desc="laugh"/> okay we've had that pipe number three times is anybody else gonna spot it?</u>
<u n="891" who="S0622">mm</u>
<u n="892" who="S0525">sometimes they don't</u>
<u n="893" who="S0622">suppose they'd pay you for what they were supposed to have and that was it <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="894" who="S0525">yeah er they you know you've <trunc>si</trunc></u>
<u n="895" who="S0622" trans="overlap">but</u>

<u n="902" who="S0525" trans="overlap">they'll go for something like that well hang on you've charged us for this delivery this pipe number on three delivery notes we're paying for it once well</u>
<u n="903" who="S0622" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="904" who="S0525">they know they've had four pipes <vocal desc="laugh"/> on every single</u>

<u n="907" who="S0622">no</u>
<u n="908" who="S0525">but it's it's that actual number that erm and that that number gets put on when it's made then it gets coated and at a factory probably in I dunno where they're doing the coating if they're doing it in Turkey or Holland and then they write that number back on</u>
<u n="909" who="S0622">oh</u>
<u n="910" who="S0525" trans="overlap"><unclear>or</unclear> so you've got somebody writing it so A you've got some young guy who's not that bothered who's earning you know a fiver an hour</u>
<u n="911" who="S0622">mm mm</u>
<u n="912" who="S0525">who maybe is dyslexic <vocal desc="laugh"/> so he's not writing it necessarily correctly</u>
<u n="913" who="S0622">well</u>
<u n="914" who="S0525">cos he's been told it's this and he's you know so you've got that to deal with then you've got the fact that erm you get another process on it and it gets coated over again and then it's got</u>
<u n="915" who="S0622" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear>gets</unclear> covered over</u>
<u n="916" who="S0525">well it does and then you've got</u>

<u n="918" who="S0525">er the dirt</u>
<u n="919" who="S0622" trans="overlap">does that they then write the number on again?</u>
<u n="920" who="S0525">they they they write it on with some sort of paint or whatever but you've got somebody er been told er that's this number coming out it goes in as this gets coated so at the other end they're writing the number back on</u>
<u n="921" who="S0622"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="922" who="S0525">cos it's it's not</u>
<u n="923" who="S0622" trans="overlap">so I suppose along the way there's lots of</u>
<u n="924" who="S0525" trans="overlap">it's not it's not a stamp if it was like a big heat stamp in the no problem but it's not it's written on the outside of it and it's coated and it's lined doesn't matter</u>
<u n="925" who="S0622" trans="overlap"><unclear>just</unclear></u>
<u n="926" who="S0525">where you put it</u>
<u n="927" who="S0622" trans="overlap"><unclear>just</unclear> another er</u>
<u n="928" who="S0525">so you've got you've got so that's erm</u>
<u n="929" who="S0622" trans="overlap">process that could get erm</u>
<u n="930" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah so it it could be wrong before it</u>
<u n="931" who="S0622" trans="overlap">wrong</u>
<u n="932" who="S0525">before it leaves the continent</u>
<u n="933" who="S0622">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="934" who="S0525">in which case you've got no chance</u>
<u n="935" who="S0622"><vocal desc="laugh"/> flawless system</u>
<u n="936" who="S0525" trans="overlap">but the other thing at the end of the day you say to the customer right you ordered you know seven hundred pipes you've got seven hundred pipes</u>
<u n="937" who="S0622" trans="overlap">you've got seven hundred</u>
<u n="938" who="S0525">alright? so</u>
<u n="939" who="S0622">yeah</u>
<u n="940" who="S0525">there's been crossovers with the numbers due to blah blah blah</u>
<u n="941" who="S0622">yeah so what you moaning at?</u>
<u n="942" who="S0525">yeah</u>
<u n="943" who="S0622">you've got seven hundred</u>
<u n="944" who="S0525">yeah</u>
<u n="945" who="S0622">paid for seven hundred</u>
<u n="946" who="S0525">yeah</u>
<u n="947" who="S0622">call it quits</u>
<u n="948" who="S0525">yeah so as long as you</u>
<u n="949" who="S0622"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="950" who="S0525">get a signed delivery note for four pipes</u>
<u n="951" who="S0622">yeah that's the that's the main thing</u>
<u n="952" who="S0525" trans="overlap">you know writing the numbers on is important <trunc>b</trunc>because it's to do with traceability like when we had the erm er the <anon type="place"/> the <anon type="place"/> erm and a section of it they <trunc>d</trunc>they decided this section was failing or whatever well the first thing you do is look at the pipe numbers and those pipe numbers should all be traceable to a process first of all when they're lined</u>
<u n="953" who="S0622">right yeah</u>
<u n="954" who="S0525" trans="overlap">and when they're coated so it could be that there's a a particular batch</u>
<u n="955" who="S0622">oh yeah?</u>
<u n="956" who="S0525">that are all faulty because there was something wrong with the lining machines</u>
<u n="957" who="S0622" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="958" who="S0525" trans="overlap">they weren't lined properly</u>
<u n="959" who="S0622" trans="overlap"><unclear/> number</u>
<u n="960" who="S0525">or</u>
<u n="961" who="S0622" trans="overlap"><unclear>mm</unclear></u>
<u n="962" who="S0525">even when the steel was spun spirally welded they spirally weld the steel on this thing</u>
<u n="963" who="S0622">mm mm</u>
<u n="964" who="S0525">so it all gets traced back that pipe number traces it back traces the manufacturing process back so if they</u>
<u n="965" who="S0622" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="966" who="S0525">have one pipe go wrong or one pipe corrode</u>
<u n="967" who="S0622">mm</u>
<u n="968" who="S0525">then there should be a</u>
<u n="969" who="S0622" trans="overlap">you need the number off it</u>
<u n="970" who="S0525">they need the number because then they can identify the entire batch that was produced in that process and they</u>
<u n="971" who="S0622" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="972" who="S0525">so then they identify possible problems in the pipeline so it is</u>
<u n="973" who="S0622" trans="overlap"><unclear>right</unclear></u>
<u n="974" who="S0525">it's so that's why it's important</u>
<u n="975" who="S0622">mm</u>
<u n="976" who="S0525">cos it gives them the traceability</u>
<u n="977" who="S0622">well plus it's erm if they come up with a spurious number well we didn't provide you with that number <vocal desc="laugh"/> pipe</u>
<u n="978" who="S0525">yeah</u>
<u n="979" who="S0622">so where you got that pipe from?</u>
<u n="980" who="S0525">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="981" who="S0622" trans="overlap"><unclear>didn't sell them</unclear></u>
<u n="982" who="S0525" trans="overlap">well yeah</u>
<u n="983" who="S0622" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="984" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="985" who="S0622" trans="overlap">and it it covers you as well as</u>
<u n="986" who="S0525">yeah</u>
<u n="987" who="S0622">obviously going back to the</u>
<u n="988" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="989" who="S0622">manufacturers and saying</u>
<u n="990" who="S0525" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="991" who="S0622"><unclear>you know</unclear></u>
<u n="992" who="S0525">but it <trunc>w</trunc>it would be good to have a photo because if I could ever see the photo of the pipe number I could quite often pick out what number it should be just by knowing how they write the foreign numbers</u>
<u n="993" who="S0622" trans="overlap">write yeah yeah</u>
<u n="994" who="S0525">whereas <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> wouldn't pick it up</u>
<u n="995" who="S0622">no no</u>
<u n="996" who="S0525">and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> often wouldn't pick it up but you could think oh actually that's not a four that's a nine and he'd go oh oh I see what you mean you know? you er</u>
<u n="997" who="S0622">mm mm sure they do that though</u>
<u n="998" who="S0525">they have a a weird way and the ones and the sevens they've always got well it's obvious because the ones they go like a seven</u>
<u n="999" who="S0622">mm</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0525">but they don't put the line through it do they?</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0622" trans="overlap">line through it yeah</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0525">but but because they make a big thing of it like that it's just</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0622" trans="overlap">they think it's a seven</u>
