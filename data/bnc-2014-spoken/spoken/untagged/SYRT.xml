<u n="388" who="S0454">no</u>
<u n="389" who="S0455">that's it you sort of could spend a few thousand to actually have not that much benefit</u>
<u n="390" who="S0454">that's true</u>
<u n="391" who="S0455">and there were erm plans for an <trunc>ex</trunc> erm conservatory when we came right across the back here</u>

<u n="406" who="S0454" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="407" who="S0455"><unclear/> really have <unclear>views</unclear> <unclear/> the garden but I don't think that is worth the expense</u>
