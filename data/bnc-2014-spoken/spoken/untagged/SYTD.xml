<u n="3" who="S0084">oh it's really weird though <pause dur="short"/> where do like where do they come from?</u>
<u n="4" who="S0135">so when was the first one again? When you were at that party with your friend</u>
<u n="5" who="S0084">the work's do</u>
<u n="6" who="S0135">and you felt like you were in a shadow and you didn't want to say anything</u>
<u n="7" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I suppose that like that often happens <pause dur="short"/> like I feel like like I don't necessarily be the one to make the effort</u>
<u n="8" who="S0135">but then did it subside?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0084">well yeah <pause dur="short"/> I suppose I just sort of carried on and just didn't give into it <pause dur="short"/> I just thought well look calm yourself down <pause dur="short"/> calm down</u>
<u n="10" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="11" who="S0084">but I really wanted to leave <pause dur="short"/> and I was just really grateful that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>was like oh yeah I wanna go as well</u>
<u n="12" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="13" who="S0084">um</u>
<u n="14" who="S0135">did you feel sick?</u>
<u n="15" who="S0084">I just felt yeah I couldn't catch my breath <pause dur="short"/> I felt sick <pause dur="short"/> I was shaking <pause dur="short"/> I just thought oh well um I just told <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I'm just going to the loo <pause dur="short"/> I'll be back in a minute</u>
<u n="16" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0084">and just sat on the toilet for a while</u>
<u n="18" who="S0135">sort of composing yourself?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was just like just calm down <pause dur="short"/> it's fine <pause dur="short"/> um stop being an idiot <pause dur="short"/> and er but that makes it worse cos then you sort of put pressure on yourself</u>
<u n="20" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0084">um <pause dur="short"/> but it was fine <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I mean I'm just hoping that the more I sort of put myself out of my comfort zone <pause dur="short"/> I think I I think that's what it is <pause dur="short"/> I think because I haven't done anything scary or anything that challenges me for a really long time <pause dur="short"/> like I haven't been travelling <pause dur="short"/> I haven't done anything <pause dur="short"/> I haven't taken a new job <pause dur="short"/> well the last few years has been really</u>
<u n="22" who="S0135">you have taken a new job in your</u>
<u n="23" who="S0084">yeah but it doesn't really count cos it's not <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="24" who="S0135">yeah it does <pause dur="short"/> it's it's a new team <pause dur="short"/> it's new work</u>
<u n="25" who="S0084">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's got its</u>
<u n="26" who="S0135" trans="overlap">it's a new <trunc>buil</trunc> building floor <pause dur="short"/> it's a new desk</u>
<u n="27" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0135">it's a new new thing</u>
<u n="29" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's it has its own challenges I suppose</u>
<u n="30" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0084">I suppose the thing is like you get to <trunc>th</trunc> this year and you start thinking like what have I got to show for myself? I live in a crack den <pause dur="short"/> I'm only earning twenty whatever grand a year</u>
<u n="32" who="S0135">wait <pause dur="short"/> just watch everything that you're saying right now because that will drag me down with you</u>
<u n="33" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/> No because it's all relative <pause dur="short"/> it's all relative to what you think you should have achieved by the time you're thirty</u>
<u n="34" who="S0135">right</u>
<u n="35" who="S0084">and in my head when I was twenty-one I thought by the time I'm thirty I will have at least have a man if not be married</u>
<u n="36" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0084">and with a potential for children at some time in my thirties <pause dur="short"/> and now that I'm here I think well there's no man on the scene <pause dur="short"/> therefore kinder would be a a number of years later</u>
<u n="38" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="39" who="S0084">could I be a single mum? Because you've got  you've got  entertain the notion that you're just not datable <pause dur="short"/> which is possible <pause dur="short"/> I might not be <pause dur="short"/> and in which case I er wanna have kids so then I'll just get er some sperm <pause dur="short"/> but I need to be financially stable in order to do that <pause dur="short"/> and I wanna do all the things that I wanna do before I entertain that idea <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="40" who="S0135" trans="overlap">that's just like putting pressure on yourself</u>
<u n="41" who="S0084">I think because there's no it's almost like because there's no limit to the possibilities</u>
<u n="42" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="43" who="S0084">it's really difficult to then think okay then what do I want to do <pause dur="short"/> and the more I think about it the more I panic the more I think oh my God well what am I gonna do with myself <pause dur="short"/> I can't  I can't  think of something that I wanna do so much that I'm working towards it</u>
<u n="44" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="45" who="S0084">like I don't know whether I should move here or there <pause dur="short"/> or do this job or that job <pause dur="short"/> and then start to <trunc>pan</trunc> really panic myself <pause dur="short"/> and I think just calm down it's fine <pause dur="short"/> but the more times that I get panicked about it the worse it seems to be <pause dur="short"/> so I think I just need to make a plan <pause dur="short"/> just any plan <pause dur="short"/> whatever the plan is <pause dur="short"/> even if it turns out to be shit at least it's a plan</u>
<u n="46" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0084">and at least it means that I'll be working towards something so</u>
<u n="48" who="S0135">I wonder if it's anything to do with the fact that um <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> are getting married <pause dur="short"/> and um like we we are both single <pause dur="short"/> we have each other</u>
<u n="49" who="S0084">we have each other</u>
<u n="50" who="S0135">and <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> is single</u>
<u n="51" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0135">erm</u>
<u n="53" who="S0084">which is fine <pause dur="short"/> you but you sort of get to this age and think you would have found somebody <pause dur="short"/> and only because it's like four years</u>
<u n="54" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="55" who="S0084">single for four years is quite a long time</u>
<u n="56" who="S0135">yeah but you've had blokes in that time though <pause dur="short"/> you've had options and dalliances and</u>
<u n="57" who="S0084">but</u>
<u n="58" who="S0135">it just hasn't been the right one</u>
<u n="59" who="S0084">I mean I was only half joking when I said you lose a part of your soul each time</u>
<u n="60" who="S0135">oh right</u>
<u n="61" who="S0084" trans="overlap">Cos people do like <pause dur="short"/> it is quite depressing with each one that you can rule out <pause dur="short"/> cos that's a lot of men that you're ruling out <pause dur="short"/> and a lot of different types of men <pause dur="short"/> my ear keeps um</u>
<u n="62" who="S0135">filling up with fluid and <pause dur="short"/> shall we drain it? Let's lance it <pause dur="short"/> does it go muffley?</u>
<u n="63" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I had a bath earlier <pause dur="short"/> maybe that's what</u>
<u n="64" who="S0135">oh no <pause dur="short"/> you're gonna get your ear syringed</u>
<u n="65" who="S0084" trans="overlap">there's water in it really <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh</u>
<u n="66" who="S0135">Don't do that</u>
<u n="67" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Just <unclear/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0135" trans="overlap">Don't get it syringed <pause dur="short"/> don't do that <pause dur="short"/> never let them come at you with a needle</u>
<u n="69" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="70" who="S0135">not towards your ear <pause dur="short"/> it's quite a vital organ</u>
<u n="71" who="S0084">well it's because I was getting what I thought was my wisdom teeth coming through <pause dur="short"/> but the pain is also like here as well</u>
<u n="72" who="S0135" trans="overlap">shit man <pause dur="short"/> just wisdom teeth</u>
<u n="73" who="S0084">um</u>
<u n="74" who="S0135">maybe you'll be wise when they come through</u>
<u n="75" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <unclear/> more wise that'd be nice</u>
<u n="76" who="S0135">wiser <pause dur="short"/> older and wiser</u>
<u n="77" who="S0084">well you'd think something <pause dur="short"/> there must be something good about ageing <pause dur="short"/> there isn't anything good so far <pause dur="short"/> there's nothing that springs immediately to mind</u>
<u n="78" who="S0135">no <pause dur="short"/> I think we should <trunc>may</trunc> maybe your plan should be to invent a time machine</u>
<u n="79" who="S0084">that'd be quite nice <pause dur="short"/> I'll I'll start working on that</u>
<u n="80" who="S0135">but has the pressures come from anywhere else? Or are they all completely self</u>
<u n="81" who="S0084">I think they're self-imposed</u>
<u n="82" who="S0135">right <pause dur="short"/> I think it's part of the western culture that you know you think you should be married and have children</u>
<u n="83" who="S0084">own a house</u>
<u n="84" who="S0135">and have a career and own a house <pause dur="short"/> all that shit</u>
<u n="85" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0135">but if you go into different cultures <pause dur="short"/> and like say for example in Germany no one owns their own house</u>
<u n="87" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0135">no one <pause dur="short"/> I didn't</u>
<u n="89" who="S0084">this is what I keep telling myself</u>
<u n="90" who="S0135">I didn't know a single person in the embassy that owned their own house</u>
<u n="91" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0135">not a single one of them <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="93" who="S0084">it's a different culture</u>
<u n="94" who="S0135">it's just a completely different culture <pause dur="short"/> in Italy the men will live with their mums until their mid-thirties</u>
<u n="95" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="96" who="S0135">um</u>
<u n="97" who="S0084">we're in that we're in the shit generation</u>
<u n="98" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0084">I mean our parents had it quite good</u>
<u n="100" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0084">Cos they were the baby boomers <pause dur="short"/> so they got all the houses so</u>
<u n="102" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0084">mortgages were more readily available <pause dur="short"/> there were more opportunities for work</u>
<u n="104" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0084">but the generation before that <pause dur="short"/> our Grandparent's generation had to live through the war so they were the shit generation</u>
<u n="106" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0084">so I think it's just gonna be that our kids will have a good generation</u>
<u n="108" who="S0135" trans="overlap">reciprocal <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> well not</u>
<u n="109" who="S0084">unless we fuck up the world</u>
<u n="110" who="S0135">I'm not having any <pause dur="short"/> but yours maybe</u>
<u n="111" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="112" who="S0135">I'll be their aunty <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0135">maybe I don't know maybe your like biological clock's kicked in or something</u>
<u n="115" who="S0084">something's going on</u>
<u n="116" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0084">I think well what I need is a plan</u>
<u n="118" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="119" who="S0084">and I feel very listless <pause dur="short"/> and I think as soon as I got the job at the press</u>
<u n="120" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0084">I was a bit like right okay so now what?</u>
<u n="122" who="S0135">because that's what</u>
<u n="123" who="S0084">within a matter of moments</u>
<u n="124" who="S0135">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that might be because that's what you'd been always working towards</u>
<u n="125" who="S0084">and you if you lose that</u>
<u n="126" who="S0135">and then you got it and you were like bang <pause dur="short"/> I got it</u>
<u n="127" who="S0084">and and now what?</u>
<u n="128" who="S0135" trans="overlap">now what?</u>
<u n="129" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="130" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="131" who="S0084">and if you just spend your life working towards something <pause dur="short"/> cos when you were younger your parents were like well you're gonna go to university</u>
<u n="132" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0084">there's never really an option not to</u>
<u n="134" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0084">I mean they say there's not but there isn't</u>
<u n="136" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0084">so that's what you spend your life working towards <pause dur="short"/> and then you finish uni and you're a bit like oh now what do I do?</u>
<u n="138" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0084">sort of bum around for a while <pause dur="short"/> the you make another plan</u>
<u n="140" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="141" who="S0084">and that follows through <pause dur="short"/> and you think okay well that's great <pause dur="short"/> got that</u>
<u n="142" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="143" who="S0084">well now so now what?</u>
<u n="144" who="S0135">mm mm</u>
<u n="145" who="S0084">and now I've I've got a job that I really enjoy <pause dur="short"/> I really like my job which is quite fortunate I know</u>
<u n="146" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0084">I know it's like I'm quite lucky to enjoy my job</u>
<u n="148" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="149" who="S0084">but at the same time it is a job I could do anywhere for any publishing house in any business stream</u>
<u n="150" who="S0135" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0084">it's not specific to ELT so again I'm quite fortunate in that regard <pause dur="short"/> but it does mean that I have to find a way of making my skill set unique to an employer in another country <pause dur="short"/> rather than just hire somebody that they have there</u>
<u n="152" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0084">so that's that's the problem <pause dur="short"/> I couldn't apply for a job here for a job abroad because they would just hire somebody there</u>
<u n="154" who="S0135" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0084">so I would have to move there <pause dur="short"/> but it it I mean it that's why I would struggle to go somewhere where that I didn't speak the language</u>
<u n="156" who="S0135">what? What is it that makes you think that you wanna move abroad? Change?</u>
<u n="157" who="S0084">it's just yeah just a  just a  new challenge <pause dur="short"/> just to see more of the world <pause dur="short"/> and every time I see somewhere new I get the feeling that I'm not going to see everywhere</u>
<u n="158" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="159" who="S0084">which is just unrealistic <pause dur="short"/> you're not gonna see everywhere</u>
<u n="160" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0084">I'd like to visit every country at least once</u>
<u n="162" who="S0135">mm okay</u>
<u n="163" who="S0084">and I'm thirty now and I've not really seen that much</u>
<u n="164" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="165" who="S0084" trans="overlap">I've seen some <pause dur="short"/> so I mean that's the immediate plan</u>
<u n="166" who="S0135">mm mm</u>
<u n="167" who="S0084">Cos there's no point staying at home to save for a mortgage cos I'd never be able to scrape together the deposit</u>
<u n="168" who="S0135" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="169" who="S0084">even though they're saying on er Rightmove I was having a look the other day that there's they've brought something out to help first time buyers <pause dur="short"/> all this sort of gobbins <pause dur="short"/> so like which if you're still interested you should look at</u>
<u n="170" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="171" who="S0084">but I'm still never going to be able to get together half of the deposit for round here</u>
<u n="172" who="S0135">not on your own</u>
<u n="173" who="S0084">not on my own</u>
<u n="174" who="S0135">and that it's not just the deposit <pause dur="short"/> it's about finding a lender</u>
<u n="175" who="S0084">mm mm</u>
<u n="176" who="S0135">who will lend your mortgage</u>
<u n="177" who="S0084">exactly</u>
<u n="178" who="S0135">because your mortgage will probably be in the region of you know six hundred to nine hundred pound a month</u>
<u n="179" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="180" who="S0135">could you afford that?</u>
<u n="181" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="182" who="S0135">could you find a lender to lend it to you even if you get the deposit?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0135">but I mean do you actually want to own a house? Or do you think you should own one?</u>
<u n="185" who="S0084">I'd like to own a house</u>
<u n="186" who="S0135">right</u>
<u n="187" who="S0084">at the same time it's not on my list of priorities</u>
<u n="188" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="189" who="S0084">versus travelling around the world with a backpack on my back <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="190" who="S0135" trans="overlap">right yeah</u>
<u n="191" who="S0084">like it would be nice to have the stability that if I owned a house here I could rent it out <pause dur="short"/> I could pay off my mortgage and I could naff off and I would be able to come back to something</u>
<u n="192" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="193" who="S0084">Cos my worry is if I go away I don't know what's gonna happen to the jobs market</u>
<u n="194" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="195" who="S0084">I don't know what's gonna happen to house prices <pause dur="short"/> I mean</u>
<u n="196" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="197" who="S0084">if I go away and come back it's going to be difficult</u>
<u n="198" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0084">and I need to leave myself enough money to come back to and that's why I want to work in the same field that I'm working in now</u>
<u n="200" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="201" who="S0084">because I don't want er to come back and an employer say well why did you go fruit picking for a year when you had a perfectly good career so</u>
<u n="202" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="203" who="S0084">I don't want to go fruit picking but</u>
<u n="204" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="205" who="S0084">and at least in that regard I have found a job that I do want to do <pause dur="short"/> so if I were to move abroad that would be the type of job that I was looking for so at least that would be some sort of guide</u>
<u n="206" who="S0135" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="207" who="S0084">I don't know</u>
<u n="208" who="S0135" trans="overlap">I think</u>
<u n="209" who="S0084">I feel like I think about it all the time and I never actually do anything so</u>
<u n="210" who="S0135">I think what you need to do is you need to get either a journal or a massive blank piece of paper and write it all down to try and untangle this web <pause dur="short"/> because I think you've got a lot of uh competing ideas but you're not clear what your priority is <pause dur="short"/> like you don't know</u>
<u n="211" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I don't know</u>
<u n="212" who="S0135">what is the most important to you <pause dur="short"/> and I think you're being influenced by as one is by I dunno parental expectations friend's expectations the media and</u>
<u n="213" who="S0084">exactly</u>
<u n="214" who="S0135">what everyone thinks everyone should be doing and colleagues and going for promotion and going for a house and doing this and all that <pause dur="short"/> whereas actually if you want to go and fruit pick with a back pack on your back and return to your mum's spare room</u>
<u n="215" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="216" who="S0135">if you are super happy travelling and that's the thing that makes you happy that's what you have to go for</u>
<u n="217" who="S0084" trans="overlap">do that</u>
<u n="218" who="S0135">but I think that you probably need to just sort of take some time you know sort of get it all down on paper maybe <pause dur="short"/> untangle it all and figure out what is it that's actually that what makes you happy</u>
<u n="219" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="220" who="S0135">and what do you want? And there's like a couple of like techniques <pause dur="short"/> um one er you might have heard of it <pause dur="short"/> like the Death Bed test or something <pause dur="short"/> and it's probably quite complicated and you probably shouldn't do it unless there's someone's who's a grown up but like you know if you're on your death bed</u>
<u n="221" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="222" who="S0135">would you look back and think I wish I'd done this or that was a bad idea or I should have done more about that <pause dur="short"/> I wish I hadn't even bothered worrying about that <pause dur="short"/> cos that's like a technique</u>
<u n="223" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="224" who="S0135">of trying to help you figure out what's important</u>
<u n="225" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="226" who="S0135">and all that other kind of stuff</u>
<u n="227" who="S0084">mm mm <pause dur="short"/> well that all makes sense yeah</u>
<u n="228" who="S0135">um yeah I mean in theory they'll all probably make a lot of sense <pause dur="short"/> but in reality it's quite difficult <pause dur="short"/> um you know just to kind of try and boil it all down because</u>
<u n="229" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="230" who="S0135">there's loads and loads of different causes of panic attacks <pause dur="short"/> I mean with me I think I was bored and so</u>
<u n="231" who="S0084">oh right</u>
<u n="232" who="S0135">my brain</u>
<u n="233" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="234" who="S0135">would start analysing and over-analysing everything <pause dur="short"/> and like being like super um sensitive to what I was feeling</u>
<u n="235" who="S0084">oh okay</u>
<u n="236" who="S0135">like oh God I feel a bit sick <pause dur="short"/> oh yes I actually <trunc>d</trunc> I feel really really sick <pause dur="short"/> I'm gonna be sick <pause dur="short"/> I've gotta go sort of thing</u>
<u n="237" who="S0084">oh God</u>
<u n="238" who="S0135">so I think it mine was kind of like from boredom</u>
<u n="239" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="240" who="S0135">and also like loneliness</u>
<u n="241" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="242" who="S0135">and like a lack of people to talk to and stuff like that</u>
<u n="243" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="244" who="S0135">um <pause dur="short"/> and so yours are probably going to be quite a different cause <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="245" who="S0084">too much going on in my brain</u>
<u n="246" who="S0135">well maybe <trunc>may</trunc> and it's your body maybe your body's way of saying hold the phone</u>
<u n="247" who="S0084">uh</u>
<u n="248" who="S0135">right <pause dur="short"/> you know? I don't <trunc>kn</trunc> I mean I don't know <pause dur="short"/> we're all just guessing aren't we?</u>
<u n="249" who="S0084">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="250" who="S0135">erm <pause dur="short"/> but you're a hundred percent right when you say and when <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and everything says that you have to carry on <pause dur="short"/> it's so true <pause dur="short"/> face your fears</u>
<u n="251" who="S0084">oh man</u>
<u n="252" who="S0135">that is so true</u>
<u n="253" who="S0084" trans="overlap">that's hard isn't it?</u>
<u n="254" who="S0135">it's absolutely terrifying</u>
<u n="255" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="256" who="S0135">like me I haven't been out for a meal in quite a while</u>
<u n="257" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="258" who="S0135">because for whatever reason <unclear/> have got into me <pause dur="short"/> but I know</u>
<u n="259" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="260" who="S0135">the only way to get through it is to go along and do it and everything <pause dur="short"/> and eventually it will get busy erm busy easier</u>
<u n="261" who="S0084" trans="overlap">better</u>
<u n="262" who="S0135">like when I didn't want to go flying anywhere</u>
<u n="263" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="264" who="S0135">and I was absolutely terrified <pause dur="short"/> and the first four sort of three of four flights were absolutely horrendous <pause dur="short"/> I thought I was gonna be sick <pause dur="short"/> I was sweating</u>
<u n="265" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="266" who="S0135">I was horror blah blah <pause dur="short"/> but now the last one I took fine absolutely fine</u>
<u n="267" who="S0084">Good</u>
<u n="268" who="S0135">erm the thing is like even going out for a simple drink <pause dur="short"/> going out for coffee <pause dur="short"/> things like that</u>
<u n="269" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="270" who="S0135">A busy place whatever</u>
<u n="271" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="272" who="S0135">avoid it like the plague</u>
<u n="273" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="274" who="S0135">but you have to put yourself in it <pause dur="short"/> and you have to stick it out so you can prove to your body nothing dangerous happened <pause dur="short"/> it was okay and I survived it <pause dur="short"/> but by  But by  not going into it your body thinks you've got something to be scared of</u>
<u n="275" who="S0084">yeah and that makes it worse</u>
<u n="276" who="S0135" trans="overlap">and if you  And if you  run off before you've experienced it</u>
<u n="277" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="278" who="S0135">that's how you build up the fear</u>
<u n="279" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="280" who="S0135">it's the hardest thing in the world <pause dur="short"/> and that's why fear is sort of like self-perpetuating like self-fuelling and everything</u>
<u n="281" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm mm</u>
<u n="282" who="S0135">and it's just so terrifying when you're in the minute <pause dur="short"/> logically and rationally you can sit here and go yeah I used to love going out <trunc>t</trunc> moshing it concerts and</u>
<u n="283" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="284" who="S0135">er whatever and meeting new people</u>
<u n="285" who="S0084">being at a festival</u>
<u n="286" who="S0135">and festivals and all that sort of stuff <pause dur="short"/> what's happened now? Why am I a bit? Why am I like querying me? And stuff like that you know <pause dur="short"/> cos it's not like a logical or a rational fear which makes it really frustrating</u>
<u n="287" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think but that's the thing in in the moment that's what you're trying to tell yourself <pause dur="short"/> you're trying to calm yourself down but there's nothing logical or rational about it</u>
<u n="288" who="S0135" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="289" who="S0084">I think you're right <pause dur="short"/> you you know it is just about sort of pulling together more of a plan and and more like more cohesion to my thoughts <pause dur="short"/> because at the moment it is just a massive jumble</u>
<u n="290" who="S0135">it's a jumble</u>
<u n="291" who="S0084">and that's what panics me</u>
<u n="292" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="293" who="S0084">is that there's is that I'm ageing every day <pause dur="short"/> life is getting away from me and I haven't got a plan</u>
<u n="294" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="295" who="S0084">but at least if I was you know I was living in a crack den but it's okay cos I'm saving money and it means that in a year I'm going to be doing something amazing</u>
<u n="296" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="297" who="S0084">but for now I can just take every day as it is and enjoy it</u>
<u n="298" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="299" who="S0084">because I'm working towards something</u>
<u n="300" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="301" who="S0084">so I'm not living in the future <pause dur="short"/> I'm enjoying</u>
<u n="302" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="303" who="S0084">now <pause dur="short"/> but I know that in a year's time or whenever there's gonna be another challenge <pause dur="short"/> there's going to be something interesting and exciting and then something to aim for</u>
<u n="304" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="305" who="S0084">Cos you do sort of inevitably get swept up in the the wheel of the office and you know oh well will I get promoted and will I get a bit more money <pause dur="short"/> and it's worth staying and</u>
<u n="306" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="307" who="S0084">I think if I stayed there I would be living in <anon type="place"/> for the next five years <pause dur="short"/> and I'm never going to meet a man here <pause dur="short"/> not that that's the be all and end all</u>
<u n="308" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="309" who="S0084">but it's just dire for men <pause dur="short"/> and just socially really</u>
<u n="310" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="311" who="S0084">you know there's not an awful lot going on <pause dur="short"/> I think it's just I need to go and meet new people and just go and experience a few things <pause dur="short"/> and I never get the same buzz from anything as I do from when I travel <pause dur="short"/> and the last time I had that was when I was in Australia and as lovely as Croatia was it was very safe <pause dur="short"/> cos it was <pause dur="short"/> you know we were there together and a long time and despite the rain</u>
<u n="312" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah it's quite touristy <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="313" who="S0084">it's quite touristy</u>

<u n="316" who="S0084">I don't know whether we picked the best dates</u>
<u n="317" who="S0135">it was August I mean what and what else can you do? I mean</u>
<u n="318" who="S0084">we did  We did  get to see some tortoise porn <pause dur="short"/> that was quite offensive</u>

<u n="323" who="S0135" trans="overlap">that's not travelling <pause dur="short"/> that was a holiday</u>
<u n="324" who="S0084">that was like you know sort of ten days</u>
<u n="325" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="326" who="S0084">nice couple of days in Berlin <unclear/> A week in Croatia living in our nice little house was you know nice and safe and easy</u>
<u n="327" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="328" who="S0084">whereas when I was in Australia I was on my own <pause dur="short"/> and I was going to see exciting places <pause dur="short"/> and it was different like just having to fly between places and meet new people and <pause dur="short"/> I don't know it's just I get that buzz when I do that</u>
<u n="329" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> what's?</u>
<u n="330" who="S0084">and I get really excited <pause dur="short"/> and I live for that <pause dur="short"/> and like that's the most important thing</u>
<u n="331" who="S0135" trans="overlap">what's stopping you from booking a flight in two months and going with Nicky over there?</u>
<u n="332" who="S0084">money <pause dur="short"/> financially I couldn't do it</u>
<u n="333" who="S0135">and do you not have the funds?</u>
<u n="334" who="S0084">no cos you have to have five thousand US dollars in your bank account when you enter the country</u>
<u n="335" who="S0135">mm <pause dur="short"/> if you?</u>
<u n="336" who="S0084" trans="overlap">and your flights would be like fifteen hundred pounds</u>
<u n="337" who="S0135" trans="overlap">if you had ten thousand pounds would you?</u>
<u n="338" who="S0084">I'd go now <pause dur="short"/> I would get my passport</u>
<u n="339" who="S0135" trans="overlap">you would go</u>
<u n="340" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's just a question of funds <pause dur="short"/> I would just get on the first plane <pause dur="short"/> I would er drive to Stanstead now in Olive and I would get on the first flight</u>
<u n="341" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0084">because really it's only money</u>
<u n="343" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0084">and that's what stopping me <pause dur="short"/> like if you know if I came into money now that's it I'd be off</u>
<u n="345" who="S0135">yeah <pause dur="short"/> you wouldn't take a caravan and go around England with my ex-boyfriend <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>?</u>
<u n="346" who="S0084" trans="overlap">it seems unlikely <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> It seems pretty unlikely <pause dur="short"/> I mean the that's there's er time for that</u>
<u n="347" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="348" who="S0084">when I'm old and decrepit if we haven't destroyed the planet by then <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>

<u n="350" who="S0084">er yes so I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I think I'm just gonna save like a beast <pause dur="short"/> like with these recordings it's obviously been really great to pay off my overdraft <pause dur="short"/> and I'll get another <pause dur="short"/> I'll get one payment in my next bank in my next pay check which will be</u>
<u n="351" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="352" who="S0084">mid-April <pause dur="short"/> and then the <trunc>ne</trunc> the last one will be mid-May and I'll put that amount into my savings account which will probably be like four or five hundred pounds <pause dur="short"/> put that straight in</u>
<u n="353" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="354" who="S0084">and that'll be the start of it <pause dur="short"/> and my mum's already said like if <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> does move out in September <pause dur="short"/> cos if she doesn't go to Berlin or</u>
<u n="355" who="S0135">yep</u>

<u n="359" who="S0135">really why?</u>
<u n="360" who="S0084">I think when you finish uni it's horrendous isn't it? Because</u>

<u n="377" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="378" who="S0084">what it's like when you're at uni <pause dur="short"/> and you go to the student union <pause dur="short"/> and you know everybody and</u>

<u n="385" who="S0135"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="386" who="S0084">but it was at the time when my mum and dad were together when I was living in the house and</u>
<u n="387" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="388" who="S0084">I think they were quite understanding <pause dur="short"/> I think when I moved back I didn't work for a few months because</u>

<u n="390" who="S0084">obviously you don't pay rent or anything <pause dur="short"/> I mean you're living with your parents</u>
<u n="391" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="392" who="S0084">but now erm <pause dur="short"/> it's cos she's my mum  my mum  has obviously not got much money so she pays <pause dur="short"/> there's not mortgage on the house so she doesn't pay rent</u>
<u n="393" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="394" who="S0084">but she pays I think she pays a hundred and fifty pounds a month <pause dur="short"/> so that's like board basically <pause dur="short"/> like utilities and food</u>
<u n="395" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="396" who="S0084">so it's pretty cheap <pause dur="short"/> it's cheaper than what she'd be paying in Norwich <pause dur="short"/> so she's managed to save quite a lot of money <pause dur="short"/> and she's quite savvy with money unlike moi</u>
<u n="397" who="S0135">you are so savvy</u>
<u n="398" who="S0084">er I would like to say I am <pause dur="short"/> I think car booting would be good <pause dur="short"/> I've also got my old violins to sell <pause dur="short"/> I weren't take them to car boots though</u>

<u n="404" who="S0084">lottery <pause dur="short"/> yeah I think it's probably a waste of money but yeah maybe <pause dur="short"/> someone's gotta win it</u>

<u n="542" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="543" who="S0084">but you also wanna pay for your flights</u>
<u n="544" who="S0135">which are what?</u>
<u n="545" who="S0084">about fifteen hundred pounds <pause dur="short"/> when I flew out my flights were one thousand pounds</u>
<u n="546" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="547" who="S0084">and that was Christmas <pause dur="short"/> and I won't be flying at Christmas so it'll be cheaper</u>
<u n="548" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="549" who="S0084">and I won't be flying to mental places <pause dur="short"/> but if I wanna fly if I wanna stop over somewhere then basically I need to have five thousand pounds saved</u>
<u n="550" who="S0135">okay <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="551" who="S0084" trans="overlap">so if you think  So if you think  in May <pause dur="short"/> with my May which is the eighteenth of May I'll put five hundred pounds in then</u>
<u n="552" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="553" who="S0084">because that'll be the recordings</u>
<u n="554" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="555" who="S0084">I suppose I could put more in because it'll be the recordings plus the start of my <pause dur="short"/> I just don't know what my overdraft will be like then <pause dur="short"/> cos I've had my mum's birthday and all kinds of stuff going out recently so</u>
<u n="556" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0084">say say in May we that's the point where we start <pause dur="short"/> may June July August September October November December <pause dur="short"/> by December that's eight months of five hundred pounds <pause dur="short"/> eight fives are forty</u>
<u n="558" who="S0135">yeah in only ten months</u>
<u n="559" who="S0084">so I need to be <trunc>t</trunc> so in March <pause dur="short"/> so yeah I could book things in March next year</u>
<u n="560" who="S0135">er let me just double check your maths <pause dur="short"/> no offence</u>
<u n="561" who="S0084">February maybe</u>
<u n="562" who="S0135">erm <vocal desc="laugh"/> In March <pause dur="short"/> I was gonna say March April <pause dur="short"/> no May June July August September October November December January Feb</u>
<u n="563" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="564" who="S0135">so you can technically</u>
<u n="565" who="S0084" trans="overlap">I'd book in March probably</u>
<u n="566" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="567" who="S0084">that would give me five thousand pounds</u>
<u n="568" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="569" who="S0084">and I'd want to have at least that really <pause dur="short"/> so this is the point</u>
<u n="570" who="S0135" trans="overlap">it's a lot sooner than we thought actually</u>
<u n="571" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and plus if I do move home in September <pause dur="short"/> I mean this is based on me not having to move home which the is the is what what we're aiming for <pause dur="short"/> I don't want to move home</u>
<u n="572" who="S0135">do you not?</u>
<u n="573" who="S0084">no</u>
<u n="574" who="S0135">how much would you save by moving home though? Not that much</u>
<u n="575" who="S0084">not that much because I'd have to give my mum</u>
<u n="576" who="S0135">how much does she want? A hundred and eighty</u>
<u n="577" who="S0084">A hundred and fifty <pause dur="short"/> so I'd get</u>

<u n="579" who="S0084">I'd save two hundred pounds more every month for</u>
<u n="580" who="S0135">um but actually if that if that was just for September October November Jan Feb and you knew you were off in March for example</u>
<u n="581" who="S0084" trans="overlap">it would literally be six months <pause dur="short"/> and two sixes are twelve so that'd be an extra grand</u>
<u n="582" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="583" who="S0084">it's worth doing isn't it?</u>
<u n="584" who="S0135">so then technically you could almost leave earlier then <pause dur="short"/> you could almost leave in January</u>
<u n="585" who="S0084">but then my plan was always to leave in March next year</u>
<u n="586" who="S0135" trans="overlap">oh <pause dur="short"/> oh was it?</u>
<u n="587" who="S0084">Cos I decided in March right that's it I've gotta get out <pause dur="short"/> this time next year I've gotta be off</u>
<u n="588" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="589" who="S0084">so March is fine <pause dur="short"/> any later than March I would feel like I'm not sticking to the plan</u>

<u n="690" who="S0084">it's good isn't it <pause dur="short"/> I mean <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> likes living in the prison <pause dur="short"/> I find it quite intriguing that she's in the prison</u>
<u n="691" who="S0135">have you visited her yet?</u>
<u n="692" who="S0084">yeah I've been a couple of times</u>
<u n="693" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="694" who="S0084">and the doors do slam like she lives in a prison <pause dur="short"/> it's pretty funny <pause dur="short"/> like she lives in the houses around the prison itself</u>
<u n="695" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="696" who="S0084">on a hill <pause dur="short"/> and erm they're old warden's quarters so the doors</u>

<u n="698" who="S0084">are made of lead and they do slam <pause dur="short"/> like lights out</u>
<u n="699" who="S0135">oh God</u>
<u n="700" who="S0084">it's really funny <pause dur="short"/> but the flats are lovely <pause dur="short"/> like <trunc>th</trunc> whoever owns her flat they've done it up really well</u>
<u n="701" who="S0135" trans="overlap">really nice yeah</u>
<u n="702" who="S0084">I mean she was living in a  in a  room <pause dur="short"/> I I really would say it's probably not bigger than the Toblerone room when she first moved in and it was probably like four hundred pounds a month all in <pause dur="short"/> it was so cheap</u>
<u n="703" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="704" who="S0084">and then one girl moved out and she got bumped up the list of good rooms <pause dur="short"/> and then they got somebody else in</u>
<u n="705" who="S0135" trans="overlap">okay <pause dur="short"/> and they'd start off in a shit room and then?</u>
<u n="706" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah and then work your way up depending on how long you've been there <pause dur="short"/> like a pecking order</u>
<u n="707" who="S0135">do you know what's so funny though Liz? Take for example <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> who got married at twenty-two <pause dur="short"/> Twenty-three was it? Twenty-four?</u>
<u n="708" who="S0084" trans="overlap">I'll have a look <pause dur="short"/> mm I dunno <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't feel like that long ago but it probably was <pause dur="short"/> I think I was living in Haywards Heath so</u>
<u n="709" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="710" who="S0084">it must have been</u>
<u n="711" who="S0135">I mean her husband Steve has now just quit his teacher training</u>
<u n="712" who="S0084">cheats on her every left right and centre</u>
<u n="713" who="S0135">yeah but it it and he's quit his teacher training now <pause dur="short"/> so that's out the window <pause dur="short"/> he doesn't know what he's gonna do next <pause dur="short"/> but he inherited eighty grand from his grandparents evidently so he doesn't have to know what he's gonna do next</u>
<u n="714" who="S0084" trans="overlap">fuck <pause dur="short"/> that's be the point when you do quit your job I suppose <pause dur="short"/> but that'd be <trunc>f</trunc> pretty foolhardy if you don't know what you're gonna do though</u>
<u n="715" who="S0135">I mean it's not  it's not  a huge amount but oh</u>
<u n="716" who="S0084">it's enough to buy a house</u>
<u n="717" who="S0135" trans="overlap">it yeah it depends <pause dur="short"/> well only if you've got an income <pause dur="short"/> you need</u>
<u n="718" who="S0084">only if you've got an income yeah</u>
<u n="719" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah cos you need a mortgage</u>
<u n="720" who="S0084">no one's gonna lend to you without</u>
<u n="721" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="722" who="S0084">a fixed income</u>
<u n="723" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and income yeah <pause dur="short"/> or your partner who's got a fixed income or something <pause dur="short"/> but I tell you say for example this happens <pause dur="short"/> you book all your flights <pause dur="short"/> I bet you bottom dollar six weeks before you go you will meet the man of your dreams and you probably won't end up going or something</u>
<u n="724" who="S0084">no <pause dur="short"/> I would definitely go</u>
<u n="725" who="S0135" trans="overlap">Cos that is absolutely sod's law <pause dur="short"/> isn't it?</u>
<u n="726" who="S0084">well absolutely <pause dur="short"/> well they can come with me <pause dur="short"/> if er if it's the man of my dreams he can come in my handbag</u>
<u n="727" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="728" who="S0084">but erm I meet I might meet the man of my dreams out there <pause dur="short"/> you never know <pause dur="short"/> I think what I need to do now that I've got this plan is now work out where I am going <pause dur="short"/> cos if if Aus is the plan that's fine cos that's perfect cos that's when <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> comes back <pause dur="short"/> so my plan my my theory</u>
<u n="729" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="730" who="S0084">is my thinking that I couldn't actually go with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> cos one of us might die <pause dur="short"/> like I genuinely think I might</u>
<u n="731" who="S0135">oh how?</u>
<u n="732" who="S0084">kill her</u>
<u n="733" who="S0135">oh right</u>
<u n="734" who="S0084">she's lovely <pause dur="short"/> she's a really nice girl but we would get on each other's nerves</u>
<u n="735" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="736" who="S0084"><unclear/> you know we we we'd really fall out</u>
<u n="737" who="S0135" trans="overlap">what cos she's a bit of a space cadet or?</u>
<u n="738" who="S0084">yeah we're just <pause dur="short"/> we are really really different <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="739" who="S0135">right</u>
<u n="740" who="S0084">over a long period of time we would really grate on each other <pause dur="short"/> I think even after like the first day like being on a plane with each other for twelve hours I think would be a bit taxing <pause dur="short"/> whereas with some people you know you can just rub along with quite nicely</u>
<u n="741" who="S0135" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="742" who="S0084">erm but that might tie in cos her flight's booked her return flight's booked for February <pause dur="short"/> but she's gonna extend it if she needs to</u>
<u n="743" who="S0135">mm mm</u>
<u n="744" who="S0084">Cos she can extend it up to three times <pause dur="short"/> so maybe she'll still be out there if I booked it <pause dur="short"/> if like if I book it in March to fly out in you know whenever</u>
<u n="745" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="746" who="S0084">A couple of months after that <pause dur="short"/> erm then yeah <pause dur="short"/> or I could book it at the beginning of the year couldn't I I suppose <pause dur="short"/> cos I'd have money and I I I'd leave in April</u>
<u n="747" who="S0135" trans="overlap">so you you'd need you need a <trunc>hund</trunc> a thousand five hundred to book the flight? Did you say?</u>
<u n="748" who="S0084">well I I'm only going on what <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> recently paid for June flights</u>
<u n="749" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="750" who="S0084">but when I flew at Christmas</u>
<u n="751" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="752" who="S0084">on Boxing day they were one thousand pound return</u>
<u n="753" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="754" who="S0084">so I'm figuring it would be less than that</u>
<u n="755" who="S0135">Cos what I'd be inclined to do would be whenever you hit enough money for the flight</u>
<u n="756" who="S0084">book the flights</u>
<u n="757" who="S0135">is to book the flights</u>
<u n="758" who="S0084">yeah that's true</u>
<u n="759" who="S0135">because then that way</u>
<u n="760" who="S0084">I've gotta go</u>
<u n="761" who="S0135">you're going</u>
<u n="762" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="763" who="S0135">because I know oh at one point you were talking about going this January</u>
<u n="764" who="S0084">yeah but then I got the new job</u>
<u n="765" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="766" who="S0084">which is why I didn't go</u>
<u n="767" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="768" who="S0084">I was gonna go at the end of the year <pause dur="short"/> that was my original plan <pause dur="short"/> but in September when the job came up I was like well I'm gonna  I'm gonna  stay and take that</u>
<u n="769" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="770" who="S0084">because actually it makes more sense go with that skill set</u>
<u n="771" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="772" who="S0084">behind me because then it it would open up more doors than the job that I was doing before for Chloe <pause dur="short"/> and I wanted to kill myself</u>
<u n="773" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="774" who="S0084">erm and er really my plan was when we got back from Croatia to stay at and to stay at my mum's and work my arse off</u>
<u n="775" who="S0135">hammer it</u>
<u n="776" who="S0084">and not spend any money <pause dur="short"/> but obviously I had to move out and all those costs that I incurred</u>
<u n="777" who="S0135">oh yeah</u>
<u n="778" who="S0084" trans="overlap">like I had to pay my deposit and</u>
<u n="779" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="780" who="S0084">we'd been on holiday so there was</u>
<u n="781" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="782" who="S0084">you know you're already</u>
<u n="783" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="784" who="S0084">you know having spent money there and it just wasn't very feasible</u>
<u n="785" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="786" who="S0084">but I think yeah you're right <pause dur="short"/> I'll probably book the flight for like yeah maybe start of the year</u>
<u n="787" who="S0135">when at what  at what  point of of the year are they cheap? Cos you know like if you book them really far in advance you get an early bird deal or</u>
<u n="788" who="S0084" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> well the winter would be cheap <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="789" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="790" who="S0084">this sort of time really</u>
<u n="791" who="S0135"><anon type="place"/>?</u>
<u n="792" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="793" who="S0135">booking for a winter flight do you mean?</u>
<u n="794" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="795" who="S0135">is that the cheapest way?</u>
<u n="796" who="S0084" trans="overlap">I suppose from this point on</u>
<u n="797" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="798" who="S0084">between April and September are the cheapest flights cos that's when it's winter <pause dur="short"/> sort of September round to March is peak season</u>
<u n="799" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="800" who="S0084">and obviously that hits a head at Christmas cos it's the hottest part and it's Christmas so</u>
<u n="801" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="802" who="S0084">if my flights on boxing day were a thousand pounds</u>
<u n="803" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="804" who="S0084">but that was with erm budget China bucket airlines</u>
<u n="805" who="S0135"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="806" who="S0084">which only had one <trunc>s</trunc> TV set in each headrest</u>
<u n="807" who="S0135" trans="overlap">nice <pause dur="short"/> nice</u>
<u n="808" who="S0084">but the thing is if you're  if you're  not that fussed when you go surely you can find a flight</u>
<u n="809" who="S0135">A flexible one</u>
<u n="810" who="S0084" trans="overlap">and you know like if you  if you  there're like eight changeovers you can get really cheap flights <pause dur="short"/> or</u>
<u n="811" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="812" who="S0084">you can go on standby</u>
<u n="813" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="814" who="S0084">and live at the airport for a week</u>
<u n="815" who="S0135" trans="overlap">what about working for an airline quickly?</u>
<u n="816" who="S0084">very very quickly</u>
<u n="817" who="S0135">qantas</u>
<u n="818" who="S0084">ah</u>
<u n="819" who="S0135">very quickly</u>
<u n="820" who="S0084">very</u>
<u n="821" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="822" who="S0084">there might be some sort of law about not getting like perks for the first three months</u>
<u n="823" who="S0135" trans="overlap">oh I see <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="824" who="S0084">you might have to pass your probation and then you're fucked</u>
<u n="825" who="S0135">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I think also like I'm sure you've got all the guide books and that that kind of gumph and that already</u>
<u n="826" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="827" who="S0135">but like figuring out what is it you fancy doing when you get there <pause dur="short"/> or do you just literally wanna just touch down and take it from there <pause dur="short"/> did you wanna go across to Asia? And the start of you know putting some meat on the bones of the plan</u>
<u n="828" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="829" who="S0135">sort of make it a reality</u>
<u n="830" who="S0084">I think when I started thinking about it I thought well I'd fly into Melbourne because that's where <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> lives and because that's the place that I like the most</u>
<u n="831" who="S0135">ah <pause dur="short"/> so you can go</u>
<u n="832" who="S0084" trans="overlap">if it's it's quite I could stay with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="833" who="S0135">ah</u>
<u n="834" who="S0084">very temporarily</u>
<u n="835" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="836" who="S0084">and just say to her look can I just sleep on your floor for a couple of weeks? I'll take a sleeping bag <pause dur="short"/> and I will actively look for jobs straight away</u>
<u n="837" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="838" who="S0084">I mean like have a nice time settling in and you know be with her <pause dur="short"/> but your money gets used up so quickly when you're there that I'd wanna work straight away <pause dur="short"/> get a job straight away like in the first couple of weeks</u>
<u n="839" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="840" who="S0084">erm but it would take time so I'd like do a bit of sight-seeing in that time <pause dur="short"/> and maybe fly over to Sydney and see Tasha and get a job started straight away and then I could move out</u>
<u n="841" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="842" who="S0084">or it depends on her situation <pause dur="short"/> cos she's had a spare room for a while and it depends what she's doing <pause dur="short"/> cos we could move out together and then at least you know you've got somebody <pause dur="short"/> and then use that as my base and then save money</u>
<u n="843" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="844" who="S0084">and then work there for maybe six months <pause dur="short"/> and then go travelling <pause dur="short"/> I think because I'd wanna get my money coming in straight away <pause dur="short"/> and then I can use that as a base and have long weekends and</u>
<u n="845" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="846" who="S0084">and then keep money and then come home through Asia <pause dur="short"/> and then maybe do a few tours in places that I didn't feel that safe</u>
<u n="847" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="848" who="S0084">I'd like to go over to New Zealand as well <pause dur="short"/> you know go and see some places that I <trunc>w</trunc> like that I <trunc>rea</trunc> <unclear/> Either that I missed on the first time or</u>
<u n="849" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="850" who="S0084">like one of my colleagues <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> she  she is erm from New Zealand <pause dur="short"/> she's a Kiwi <pause dur="short"/> and we worked together for about nine months <pause dur="short"/> and she's just moved back there <pause dur="short"/> down the</u>
<u n="851" who="S0135">nice</u>
<u n="852" who="S0084">the South island <pause dur="short"/> in Dunedin <pause dur="short"/> and er she's always like yeah come up come up cos last year obviously my plan was to be in Australia for Christmas <pause dur="short"/>  you've gotta come and spend Christmas with us and</u>
<u n="853" who="S0135">ah how sweet</u>
<u n="854" who="S0084">and she's really cute <pause dur="short"/> she's got two little kids and her husband Matt who's a professor who teaches at the university</u>
<u n="855" who="S0135" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="856" who="S0084">so they're both really clever <pause dur="short"/> she's got a PhD <pause dur="short"/> and she was working as like like an office <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> basically while to support him doing his PhD <pause dur="short"/> it's like love</u>
<u n="857" who="S0135">that is love man</u>
<u n="858" who="S0084">it took her ten years to do her PhD because she decided to have kids in between</u>
<u n="859" who="S0135">fool</u>
<u n="860" who="S0084">hilarious</u>
<u n="861" who="S0135">I pity the fool</u>
<u n="862" who="S0084">she's really smart <pause dur="short"/> um so yeah there's definitely that would be the main plan I think because I'd want to work as quickly as possible</u>
<u n="863" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="864" who="S0084">so that I don't use up all my funds</u>
<u n="865" who="S0135">is there any way of? Does your company have a branch in Australia?</u>
<u n="866" who="S0084">yeah it does <pause dur="short"/> but I think you have to  you have to  wait for them to have a job to apply</u>
<u n="867" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="868" who="S0084">and I've just I've never ever seen a job advertised for the Melbourne office <pause dur="short"/> but I'm gonna speak to my group director <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> you know I used to do <unclear/> for?</u>
<u n="869" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="870" who="S0084">and erm see if a job ever comes up <pause dur="short"/> cos it's a different business stream <pause dur="short"/> it's education as opposed to English language teaching <pause dur="short"/> it's slightly different <pause dur="short"/> erm but my job would be the same <pause dur="short"/> erm I might talk to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because she works in education <pause dur="short"/> she does my job at the senior level</u>
<u n="871" who="S0135">yeah and you don't know also like even if they don't have a job maybe they know someone that looks for temporary people to do marking of er some sort of thing like you do at IELTS marking or something like that</u>
<u n="872" who="S0084">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="873" who="S0135">I mean you just don't really know</u>
<u n="874" who="S0084">well I think I would definitely get in contact with people in the office there and just say well I'm planning to move over and I just wondered if you've got jobs or how you go about recruiting people through the office and</u>
<u n="875" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="876" who="S0084">just sort of branch out really <pause dur="short"/> cos you never really get you never really meet them <pause dur="short"/> you never really work with them</u>
<u n="877" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="878" who="S0084">even though we've spoken <pause dur="short"/> we're working globally now <pause dur="short"/> we never really do so <pause dur="short"/> they're just so far away</u>
<u n="879" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="880" who="S0084">so yeah <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>w</trunc> oh <pause dur="short"/> so it's certainly um the <trunc>f</trunc> the basis of a plan</u>
<u n="881" who="S0135">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah 'tis a plan</u>
<u n="882" who="S0084">'Tis a plan <pause dur="short"/> thanks Mary</u>
<u n="883" who="S0135">yes I'm glad I came cos otherwise you probably would have figured out you could save eight thousand pounds an hour</u>
<u n="884" who="S0084"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="885" who="S0135">or it would take you twenty years to save up five grand or something</u>
<u n="886" who="S0084">yeah you you've erm you've certainly helped me with the maths there</u>
<u n="887" who="S0135">whoa <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="888" who="S0084">God what the hell's the matter with me?</u>
<u n="889" who="S0135">ha</u>
<u n="890" who="S0084">I think from this point on I need to just start being more savvy with money</u>
<u n="891" who="S0135">have you paid for all of your <trunc>t</trunc> trip so far? Like the hotels and flights and everything?</u>
<u n="892" who="S0084">yeah basically <pause dur="short"/> I haven't obviously it's things like petrol that I have to just</u>
<u n="893" who="S0135">keep an eye on</u>
<u n="894" who="S0084">budget for before</u>
<u n="895" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="896" who="S0084">so Brighton I'm gonna drive down just just for the sake of convenience but I think I need to think is it actually worth driving when I could get National Express and stuff <pause dur="short"/> like for the wedding</u>
<u n="897" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="898" who="S0084">it's first thing on Saturday morning <pause dur="short"/> so I'm gonna drive down and</u>
<u n="899" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="900" who="S0084">it's much easier to do that <pause dur="short"/> and I don't have to worry <pause dur="short"/> and I can take whatever I need for the wedding and that</u>
<u n="901" who="S0135">where are you staying on the Saturday night then?</u>
<u n="902" who="S0084">in the hotel</u>
<u n="903" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="904" who="S0084">in Kemptown <pause dur="short"/> in the B and B</u>
<u n="905" who="S0135">oh right you are</u>
<u n="906" who="S0084">and then I'll just pop in and see her on Sunday or something but erm</u>
<u n="907" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="908" who="S0084">for for <anon type="place"/> I'll probably be cos it's not far from here I'll probably just get the train</u>
<u n="909" who="S0135">yep</u>
<u n="910" who="S0084">I wonder if you could get quite a cheap train ticket versus spending like twenty-five quid on petrol</u>
<u n="911" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="912" who="S0084">or thirty quid on petrol <pause dur="short"/> it doesn't really make much sense</u>
<u n="913" who="S0135">God you're gonna have to be really dedicated</u>
<u n="914" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="915" who="S0135">like you're gonna <trunc>ha</trunc> you need to prove how much you want it because</u>
<u n="916" who="S0084">it's gonna be a real test</u>
<u n="917" who="S0135">if it all boils down  if it all boils down  to money basically</u>
<u n="918" who="S0084">which it does</u>
<u n="919" who="S0135">then you have to make those sacrifices</u>
<u n="920" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="921" who="S0135">those short term sacrifices</u>
<u n="922" who="S0084">well that's why I've said no to all the hen parties <pause dur="short"/> well I think I might just do that from now on anyway</u>
<u n="923" who="S0135" trans="overlap">oh no but that is just so hard</u>
<u n="924" who="S0084">it's really hard because I was so looking forward to Barcelona and I hadn't seen <unclear/> for ages and I knew I just know they're gonna have a lovely lovely time</u>
<u n="925" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="926" who="S0084">and Barcelona's beautiful</u>
<u n="927" who="S0135">yeah and you really like Barcelona</u>
<u n="928" who="S0084">and I mean it might even get to the point where I cancel Belfast <pause dur="short"/> but we'll see cos that's July and I haven't got anything planned <pause dur="short"/> like May is gonna be expensive</u>
<u n="929" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="930" who="S0084">April and May <pause dur="short"/> if I'm not careful <pause dur="short"/> erm and then <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> wants to go to <anon type="place"/> or <anon type="place"/> for her birthday in June <pause dur="short"/> like the Jubilee weekend so that's the beginning of June</u>
<u n="931" who="S0135" trans="overlap">I mean technically these things could all be done on the <trunc>ch</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> they don't necessarily have to be</u>
<u n="932" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="933" who="S0135">costly</u>
<u n="934" who="S0084">but like if it was in <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s birthday like if we drive there'll be four of us in the car so we'll just all chip in for petrol</u>
<u n="935" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="936" who="S0084">so that's going to be cheaper than getting the train to <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> then we'll stay at her dad's free <pause dur="short"/> and then so it'll just be drinking money</u>
<u n="937" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="938" who="S0084">and It's <anon type="place"/> so presumably it's north therefore it's cheap</u>
<u n="939" who="S0135">yeah should be about fifty P a pint</u>
<u n="940" who="S0084">er at least <pause dur="short"/> if not I'm gonna be very annoyed</u>
<u n="941" who="S0135">otherwise you're on tap water</u>
<u n="942" who="S0084">yes <pause dur="short"/> and plus I think I really can sort of drum up some crap in here and sell Ebay all my life because</u>
<u n="943" who="S0135">yeah <pause dur="short"/> do you ever sell anything on Ebay?</u>
<u n="944" who="S0084">I tried once and got really bored with it</u>
<u n="945" who="S0135">I'm addicted now</u>
<u n="946" who="S0084">are you?</u>
<u n="947" who="S0135">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think you just have to do your research though <pause dur="short"/> before you list anything</u>
<u n="948" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="949" who="S0135">have a look online <pause dur="short"/> see if there's anything else similar and then see if it shifts</u>
<u n="950" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="951" who="S0135">Cos sometimes people you know try and sell something <pause dur="short"/> there's no market if it doesn't go anywhere</u>
<u n="952" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="953" who="S0135">so like keep an eye on stuff that's actually selling and see see if you've got any like labelled clothes for example</u>
<u n="954" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="955" who="S0135">you know <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="956" who="S0084">yeah well not with my Primani wardrobe but certainly <pause dur="short"/> I mean and I've got things like a digital camera that I don't use now because I've got my Smart phone that</u>
<u n="957" who="S0135">but you will wanna take that with you if you went travelling though wouldn't you? Or <trunc>d</trunc> you'd want a digital camera</u>
<u n="958" who="S0084">well it's an eight mega-pixel camera which is what my phone is</u>
<u n="959" who="S0135">oh really?</u>
<u n="960" who="S0084">but I suppose I wouldn't be able to use my phone so that's actually quite a good point</u>
<u n="961" who="S0135">I mean it I mean those sorts of things though <pause dur="short"/> you could probably make all that money at the last stage of the plan</u>
<u n="962" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="963" who="S0135">like when you need to hike it up <pause dur="short"/> like you don't need to sell everything now</u>
<u n="964" who="S0084">yeah true</u>
<u n="965" who="S0135">I mean I suppose when you do move away you would <trunc>f</trunc> try and sell the bed</u>
<u n="966" who="S0084">sell the bed yeah</u>
<u n="967" who="S0135">if even if you ended up having to free-cycle it <pause dur="short"/> it's I don't know if you could sell the TV or give it to your mum or whatever</u>
<u n="968" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="969" who="S0135">or put it into storage <pause dur="short"/> you know sell whatever bits you know <pause dur="short"/> but that was all that's all stuff you'd do at the very end maybe</u>
<u n="970" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="971" who="S0135">erm</u>
<u n="972" who="S0084">just see how you go</u>
<u n="973" who="S0135">yeah <pause dur="short"/> see how you go</u>
<u n="974" who="S0084" trans="overlap">yeah cos basically all this stuff <pause dur="short"/> I mean you might find that you never come back</u>
<u n="975" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="976" who="S0084">or you might just be <trunc>y</trunc> a constant hermit</u>
<u n="977" who="S0135">A hobo</u>
<u n="978" who="S0084" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="979" who="S0135">A nomad</u>
<u n="980" who="S0084">A hobo <pause dur="short"/> actually <anon type="name" nameType="n"/>' friend is called <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> for just this very reason <pause dur="short"/> it's just</u>
<u n="981" who="S0135" trans="overlap">wait <trunc>w</trunc> oh as what a nickname or a real name?</u>
<u n="982" who="S0084" trans="overlap">as a nickname yeah</u>
<u n="983" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="984" who="S0084">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but erm I dunno I can't remember what her real name is but she's emigrating to Canada I think this weekend <pause dur="short"/> she's going to erm <pause dur="short"/> she's going to <pause dur="short"/> where is she going? <anon type="place"/> for some sort of leaving emigrating party or something <pause dur="short"/> well that was her excuse</u>
<u n="985" who="S0135">is she emigrating with work?</u>
<u n="986" who="S0084">erm <pause dur="short"/> no she doesn't work <pause dur="short"/> I don't know how she's emigrating <pause dur="short"/> I really don't</u>
<u n="987" who="S0135">family?</u>
<u n="988" who="S0084">I think she's got a girlfriend out there or something I don't</u>
<u n="989" who="S0135">okay</u>
<u n="990" who="S0084">no I don't really know <pause dur="short"/> but but I think she tried to emigrate there once before but then got bored so came back <pause dur="short"/> and now maybe had a change of heart <pause dur="short"/> I think this is  I think this is  at least the second emigrating party they've had for her</u>
<u n="991" who="S0135" trans="overlap">attempt <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="992" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="993" who="S0084">like seriously will you just leave now</u>
<u n="994" who="S0135" trans="overlap">bye <pause dur="short"/> bye <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>

<u n="997" who="S0084">I think she knows that restless</u>
<u n="998" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="999" who="S0084">she knows that I've got itchy feet and I think she worries that I think she probably it's a double edged sword <pause dur="short"/> she wants me to go but she doesn't want me to go <pause dur="short"/> so I don't know</u>
<u n="1000" who="S0135">really?</u>
<u n="1001" who="S0084">I think she wants me to go because otherwise I'll always wonder why</u>
<u n="1002" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1003" who="S0084">and like feel like I've missed out <pause dur="short"/> but at the same time she doesn't want me to go because she knows if I do go I'll be really far away and it'd be for quite a long time so</u>
<u n="1004" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1005" who="S0084">I think she feels a bit sad about that</u>
<u n="1006" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1007" who="S0084">and she likes the fact that now that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s moving has moved back that we're all in the same city and it's all really easy and I could just <pause dur="short"/> like <trunc>f</trunc> last week I just popped round for lunch</u>

<u n="1011" who="S0084" trans="overlap">and mum's got a really nice garden <pause dur="short"/> and so she really likes that that we can just see each other for a cup of tea or you know it's really easy</u>
<u n="1012" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah without making sort of plans six months in advance to meet up or something</u>
<u n="1013" who="S0084">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="1014" who="S0135">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos how long have you been in <anon type="place"/> now?</u>

<u n="1018" who="S0135">okay so</u>

<u n="1029" who="S0084">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="1030" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1031" who="S0084">Cos it might take you you know that's the problem where you think right I've got to change <pause dur="short"/> and it might take you another year or half a year to get yourself together</u>
<u n="1032" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1033" who="S0084">but it's that point where you think right well I've gotta do something about this</u>
<u n="1034" who="S0135">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but your mum could come and visit you</u>
<u n="1035" who="S0084">erm <trunc>sh</trunc> I'd never be able to afford a flight for her and she'd never be able to afford it</u>
<u n="1036" who="S0135">ah</u>
<u n="1037" who="S0084">I'd love her to <pause dur="short"/> I'd love them both to come out</u>
<u n="1038" who="S0135">ah</u>
<u n="1039" who="S0084">because you know they've never really travelled themselves and like that's quite upsetting that thought but they don't notice</u>
<u n="1040" who="S0135" trans="overlap">but <trunc>do</trunc> <trunc>sh</trunc> not everyone wants to <pause dur="short"/> like I met a guy <pause dur="short"/> not met a guy obviously I don't meet guys any more</u>

<u n="1113" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="1114" who="S0084">er never mind the fact that he's only like an hour down the road <pause dur="short"/> and er he said he went for the scan and he was really emotional and it was you know they're really excited about it</u>
<u n="1115" who="S0135">it's his first baby?</u>
<u n="1116" who="S0084">yeah his first baby</u>
<u n="1117" who="S0135">yeah okay yeah</u>
<u n="1118" who="S0084">so my dad's proper first grandchild <pause dur="short"/> so the girls were quite shocked when they found out</u>
<u n="1119" who="S0135"><event desc="sound of fast intake of breath"/></u>
<u n="1120" who="S0084">but they're <trunc>g</trunc> coming around to the idea now <pause dur="short"/> cos they're sixteen and fourteen so they were a bit like mum what are you doing? You're like an old woman now <pause dur="short"/> you can't have a baby</u>
<u n="1121" who="S0135" trans="overlap">ah ah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> does does she actually want one though because <trunc>sh</trunc> she was quite career orientated isn't she?</u>
<u n="1122" who="S0084" trans="overlap">she was <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah yeah she is <pause dur="short"/> erm I don't know if it's morally they would have never considered a an abortion or whether they just want to have a baby</u>
<u n="1123" who="S0135">right</u>
<u n="1124" who="S0084">I don't know but um I mean financially they can afford it <pause dur="short"/> I think it's just like health reasons <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="1125" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos that's the other thing that it's risky</u>
<u n="1126" who="S0084">it's really risky erm I think it's more risky if you haven't had a child</u>
<u n="1127" who="S0135">right <pause dur="short"/> if it's your first one</u>
<u n="1128" who="S0084">which she has</u>
<u n="1129" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1130" who="S0084">so it lowers the risk <pause dur="short"/> but obviously you know you're in your forties so it does runs a risk</u>
<u n="1131" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="1132" who="S0084">um but everything is healthy <pause dur="short"/> anna's healthy <pause dur="short"/> the baby's healthy <pause dur="short"/> so unfortunately as much as I would like not to ever have to see them again erm that isn't an option</u>
<u n="1133" who="S0135" trans="overlap">what was it? I know I always ask you this <pause dur="short"/> but what was the last thing and why did it end so on bad terms?</u>
<u n="1134" who="S0084">erm he it was the Christmas before last and it had been er just over a year <pause dur="short"/> and I was messaging him to find out what his plans were and to see if he wanted to see dad and when and what</u>
<u n="1135" who="S0135">yeah <pause dur="short"/> okay yeah yeah</u>
<u n="1136" who="S0084">and I think the year before dad had seen him on Christmas day because they hadn't had the girls <pause dur="short"/> and we'd seen mum <pause dur="short"/> because of course dad can go to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s <pause dur="short"/> mum doesn't have anybody to spend Christmas with if we're not with her</u>
<u n="1137" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1138" who="S0084">so that's what they done <pause dur="short"/> the <trunc>following</trunc> that year that I'd emailed him I was thinking would they have the girls or not <pause dur="short"/> and so I emailed them and said are you having the girls? Are you gonna invite dad over? It might make more sense for you to invite dad for Christmas day if you want to</u>
<u n="1139" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1140" who="S0084">um but just let me know and I'll try and organise stuff as well</u>
<u n="1141" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1142" who="S0084">and he wrote back just saying well if you know we've not got the girls <pause dur="short"/> and of course we will invite dad because we love dad <pause dur="short"/> subtext you don't love dad <pause dur="short"/> um I'm just wondering why you always seem to put your own mother first <pause dur="short"/> and I'm just really confused because we don't you know it seems very strange that dad's feelings always come second <pause dur="short"/> blah de blah blah</u>
<u n="1143" who="S0135">he needn't have written that</u>
<u n="1144" who="S0084" trans="overlap">so it was really cutting <pause dur="short"/> it it er came back straight like that in an email <pause dur="short"/> he must have just fired it off <pause dur="short"/> and I don't I just thought even if you now feel really guilty he never followed it up with anything <pause dur="short"/> he never <trunc>f</trunc> he never wrote back and was like sorry that was off the cuff <pause dur="short"/> I didn't mean it</u>
<u n="1145" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I didn't even think it through or anything</u>
<u n="1146" who="S0084">I didn't reply and</u>
<u n="1147" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1148" who="S0084">I thought am I being really selfish <pause dur="short"/> I spoke to mum about it <pause dur="short"/> and I was obviously I was really upset and I just and fucked off because I think</u>
<u n="1149" who="S0135">it's not true</u>

<u n="1151" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1152" who="S0084">and it's not fucking true</u>
<u n="1153" who="S0135">yeah it's not true <pause dur="short"/> that's the most annoying thing <pause dur="short"/> it's unjustified</u>
<u n="1154" who="S0084">yeah and where has it come from? It's come let out of left centre</u>
<u n="1155" who="S0135">left field yeah</u>
<u n="1156" who="S0084">left field because all I ever do is try and make sure that his feelings are taken into consideration so you can fuck off <pause dur="short"/> and in fact how often do you see dad?</u>
<u n="1157" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="1158" who="S0084">so even like last Christmas my dad didn't see him for like two or three weeks after Christmas <pause dur="short"/> he had the presents for the girls <pause dur="short"/> er it wasn't till the end of January that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> actually got his fucking act together and came to see my dad <pause dur="short"/> he bought him a massive state-of-the-art TV <pause dur="short"/> talk about guilt</u>

<u n="1312" who="S0084">I think she had quite a difficult time of it <pause dur="short"/> whereas this year she feels like</u>

<u n="1314" who="S0084">right let's get on it and that's why I try to go round like at least once a week</u>
<u n="1315" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1316" who="S0084">I mean obviously I don't want to worry about her that in extent</u>
<u n="1317" who="S0135">no</u>
<u n="1318" who="S0084">but it's nice to sort of check in and</u>

<u n="1320" who="S0084"><unclear/></u>
<u n="1321" who="S0135">but isn't <pause dur="short"/> is this something that came about relatively recently? Or do you think she's always been prone to being a bit?</u>
<u n="1322" who="S0084" trans="overlap">she's always been like that <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah she was really bad when we were growing up <pause dur="short"/> really bad <pause dur="short"/> I think because with Richard's <pause dur="short"/> you know imagine if you knew something was wrong with your kid but no one believed you <pause dur="short"/> and everyone thought it was you being a bad mum</u>
<u n="1323" who="S0135" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="1324" who="S0084">like even if you won't a depressive</u>

<u n="1326" who="S0084">that'd be fucking hard and</u>
<u n="1327" who="S0135">it wasn't sort of diagnosed and it wasn't?</u>
<u n="1328" who="S0084">it wasn't diagnosed until he was a teenager and and also having your husband doubt you <pause dur="short"/> like that was the beginning of the end I think</u>
<u n="1329" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="1330" who="S0084">it's to not feel support from her her husband <pause dur="short"/> and because my dad just was he would want to</u>
<u n="1331" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="1332" who="S0084">I think he was just incapable of doing it because he didn't really want to believe that his son had this condition</u>
<u n="1333" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1334" who="S0084">and because it's so intangible</u>
<u n="1335" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="1336" who="S0084">and it was quite unknown at the time and</u>
<u n="1337" who="S0135" trans="overlap">it's subjective as well <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="1338" who="S0084">he</u>
<u n="1339" who="S0135">you <trunc>proba</trunc> really you probably still find people today who would question</u>
<u n="1340" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="1341" who="S0135">that it that such a condition exists and wouldn't just put it down to</u>

<u n="1345" who="S0135">or unruly or blah blah blah</u>
<u n="1346" who="S0084" trans="overlap">that's certainly what people were telling her <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="1347" who="S0135" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1348" who="S0084">so I think for those reasons you know that was obviously a massive part of why she moved out of  so</u>
<u n="1349" who="S0135">yeah</u>
<u n="1350" who="S0084">um and ultimately what led to the end of their marriage <pause dur="short"/> but yeah</u>
<u n="1351" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="1352" who="S0084">I think because she had a really crappy upbringing</u>
<u n="1353" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="1354" who="S0084">A really really rubbish time and um it's amazing like you know  told you about that book <pause dur="short"/> they fuck you up <pause dur="short"/> like it's true <pause dur="short"/> like your parents play as you as we all know you know</u>
<u n="1355" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="1356" who="S0084">it just starts from such a young age <pause dur="short"/> and it's so scary that you know if you have a bad experience it could ruin you for the rest of your life <pause dur="short"/> if if you allow it to</u>
<u n="1357" who="S0135">mm</u>

<u n="1359" who="S0135">mm</u>
<u n="1360" who="S0084">like she could have been one of those parents on Jeremy Kyle that's horrible to their kids and you know</u>
