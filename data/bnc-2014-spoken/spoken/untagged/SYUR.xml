<u n="11" who="S0644">really?</u>

<u n="13" who="S0644">I love setting fire to things</u>
<u n="14" who="S0607">I mean that I have read not that I haven't read <pause dur="short"/> okay so</u>

<u n="28" who="S0607">we're going up to <pause dur="short"/> oh crap too far where we're going <pause dur="short"/> or is it? <pause dur="long"/> <anon type="place"/> er but is that <anon type="place"/> or is it? oh there there</u>
<u n="29" who="S0644"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="30" who="S0607">so mm there's <anon type="place"/></u>

<u n="35" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0607">okay so maybe we're like a third of the way</u>
<u n="37" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0607">excellent <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="39" who="S0644">there was no real erm <pause dur="short"/> long distances that we covered where there was nothing there was there? <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean? you know like when I first thought we're doing this <unclear/></u>
<u n="40" who="S0607" trans="overlap">there's always something</u>
<u n="41" who="S0644">thought we were going in remote coastal wilderness</u>
<u n="42" who="S0607">I did as well</u>
<u n="43" who="S0644" trans="overlap">where there weren't any stops and there weren't any</u>
<u n="44" who="S0607">I think we probably have to be in doing that other trip to get that you know the Texas type one</u>
<u n="45" who="S0644">yeah <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="46" who="S0607">even if I really can't be bothered when we get there I'm definitely gonna try and make myself have a walk</u>
<u n="47" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0607">cos sometimes we get there and I erm <pause dur="short"/> just think oh no</u>
<u n="49" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="50" who="S0607">awesome thanks so much for spotting that</u>
<u n="51" who="S0644">that's alright</u>
<u n="52" who="S0607">eagle eye</u>
<u n="53" who="S0644" trans="overlap">shall I invoice you every time I see one?</u>
<u n="54" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/> that might take away from the getting the cash out for free thing but yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="56" who="S0607">might as well just use another bank <pause dur="short"/> right but anyway so you were saying about erm there was there was a bit that we missed and it was about your course <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> the human being <pause dur="short"/> erm we we got erm side-tracked and you were telling me about your course do you think you can remember or <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="57" who="S0644" trans="overlap">oh just the reason I <unclear/> cos you were talking about private school and one of the <trunc>lesso</trunc> lectures one of the lecturers we had he was brilliant he was called <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and he could just speak for an hour on a subject like no notes no references no books just speak</u>
<u n="58" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0644">very eloquently for an hour on something easily anyway one particular one there were loads one particular one was erm <pause dur="short"/> about this woman MP English woman who's an MP and she was like I think she must have been in the Labour party right anyway supposed to be or professed to be erm against the idea of private schools because you know she said it's <trunc>i</trunc> the argument is that it's inherently unfair everybody should have the same opportunities blah blah blah blah blah then <vocal desc="laugh"/> she sent her kids to private school</u>
<u n="60" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="61" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="62" who="S0607">yeah this happens a lot</u>
<u n="63" who="S0644">well this is it and <pause dur="short"/> so the discussion was is she a hypocrite or not? <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="64" who="S0607">oh interesting</u>
<u n="65" who="S0644">is she a hypocrite? so one girl said an unequivocal yes</u>
<u n="66" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0644">because <pause dur="short"/> you know she spouted all this and I <trunc>s</trunc> I said well here's the thing see what I thought was what we</u>
<u n="68" who="S0607" trans="overlap">she didn't have kids when she had that opinion</u>
<u n="69" who="S0644">no <trunc>s</trunc> that's no good either</u>
<u n="70" who="S0607" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="71" who="S0644">cos that just shows you can't think outside your own</u>
<u n="72" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0644">erm <pause dur="short"/> sort of <pause dur="short"/> what's the word?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0607">yeah I know what you mean</u>
<u n="75" who="S0644" trans="overlap">you know what I mean can't think <trunc>outs</trunc> like past your nose</u>
<u n="76" who="S0607" trans="overlap">outside your yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0644"><unclear/> past your own nose <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> oh I like these little shop things they have yeah so everyone said if she had said <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> hang on what was it? how could I have forgotten that? that's my main point</u>
<u n="78" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="79" who="S0644">if she had said <pause dur="short"/> I would send my children to private school but I really think all schools should be erm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0644">of a of the same level that they should be</u>
<u n="82" who="S0607" trans="overlap">but given that they're not I'll still send mine</u>
<u n="83" who="S0644">yeah because I wouldn't I would want my children to have the best education</u>
<u n="84" who="S0607" trans="overlap">if I can afford it mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0644">and I but I <trunc>s</trunc> really think that as a rule we should try and phase out this or all schools should be of this or that or the other but she didn't say that she said they're a bad idea</u>
<u n="86" who="S0607">no one should do it</u>
<u n="87" who="S0644" trans="overlap">no one should do it and then she did it so you can't that's that is hypocrisy</u>
<u n="88" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="89" who="S0644">erm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0607">what I think is that how is it any different to how people with more money can get more things in all their areas of life? people who earn more get more stuff including I can afford private school I can afford a big car I can afford a big house</u>
<u n="91" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0607">I can afford a better holiday than you my kids can go to a better school I just don't see how it's any different</u>
<u n="93" who="S0644">well <pause dur="short"/> I'll tell you if you like</u>
<u n="94" who="S0607">cos otherwise you're gonna have to be a communist</u>
<u n="95" who="S0644">yeah this is this is kind of erm <pause dur="short"/> the problem is <pause dur="short"/> it's it's the question of what kind of society do you want to live in? do you want to live in so for example erm <pause dur="short"/> imagine if <pause dur="short"/> just take this this er imaginary scenario imagine if <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> let me think here <pause dur="short"/> at the bottom line of it is that they would say there are certain things that everyone should have a fair start in and er an equal footing in those things should at least be health everybody everybody should be entitled to good healthcare and everybody should be entitled to a good education and what you do with that thereafter cos they're they're sort of whittled down as two of your basic requirements</u>
<u n="96" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0644">in life so <pause dur="short"/> you've got communism obviously which never works and then you've got er not that I know what I'm talking about <pause dur="short"/> particularly cos I've forgotten it all I used to know all about this stuff cos I did sociology <pause dur="short"/> anyway erm <pause dur="short"/> <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> would say cos she's very kind and and fair and all the rest of it she'd say well everyone should have these basic tennets from which you like platforms from which you can then do what you want if everyone has the same healthcare erm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0644">and if everyone had a good education then you're starting from a fair point in society and then it's kind of up to you</u>
<u n="100" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="101" who="S0644">to work harder</u>
<u n="102" who="S0607" trans="overlap">make make <unclear/> you can</u>
<u n="103" who="S0644">make the most of it yeah whereas if you just say well erm <pause dur="short"/> er I've got more money than you so I I can I'm gonna have this and I'm gonna have that things like a car well you might say well that's not a necessary part of being well in life it's not it's not the main it's not the be all and end all</u>
<u n="104" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0644">but an education is a little bit more important than that and so's being able to have the drugs or the operation or whatever is <unclear>not that I</unclear></u>
<u n="106" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="107" who="S0644">would of course be erm in favour of that</u>
<u n="108" who="S0607">I mean we are lucky in our country cos we have the NHS which I <trunc>st</trunc> for so many years didn't realise that everyone didn't have their own</u>
<u n="109" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0607">national health system</u>
<u n="111" who="S0644">I know</u>
<u n="112" who="S0607">and that obviously everyone's always complaining about it but it's actually free <unclear>better</unclear> health system and and</u>
<u n="113" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0607">where we are now in America they don't have it</u>
<u n="115" who="S0644">no <pause dur="short"/> bang in trouble if you get ill here</u>
<u n="116" who="S0607" trans="overlap"><unclear/> are they still in the middle of are they getting one?</u>
<u n="117" who="S0644">I dunno what they I don't really understand it cos</u>
<u n="118" who="S0607" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="119" who="S0644">sometime you can you can call an ambulance and people will turn up</u>
<u n="120" who="S0607">yeah but I you know on my er programmes which are all based on real life <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="121" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="122" who="S0607">so like on Grey's Anatomy which is obviously a really intelligent thing to bring up</u>
<u n="123" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="124" who="S0607">I do wish that I could have these conversations like going yeah but on The Good Wife</u>
<u n="125" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="126" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/> well yeah but on Grey's Anatomy this bloke right <unclear/></u>
<u n="127" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="128" who="S0607">but it's true on Grey's Anatomy this guy came in needed emergency treatment had no insurance and they weren't able to do it so he died</u>
<u n="129" who="S0644">oh</u>
<u n="130" who="S0607">although there was one time when one of the surgeons just like <pause dur="short"/> popped his top what do you call it? blew his top off</u>
<u n="131" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="132" who="S0607">did it anyway but then he got into trouble erm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="134" who="S0607">who was gonna pay for it? cos it was like twenty thousand pound surgery and all this stuff so</u>
<u n="135" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0607">and it was a bit like seriously they're not gonna save your life</u>
<u n="137" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0607">cos you haven't got insurance</u>
<u n="139" who="S0644">yeah well that's the extreme of it isn't it? that's where you're going if you're not careful with private healthcare and private schooling and all that sort of thing if you're not careful with it it ends up it will end up being like that that's what the whole problem is with the NHS at the moment is that they're trying to sell off bits of it and I saw a documentary on it and I can't remember a bloody thing</u>
<u n="140" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="141" who="S0644">about it but it was the impression I was left with after watching it is that you can't believe that's what they're allowed to get away with and it was all about how erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah basically it's been sold off parts of it as a business <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> for example <pause dur="short"/> erm so she works in the mental health part and erm <pause dur="short"/> they <trunc>g</trunc> they made so many cuts that they can't treat all the people that that need treatment and she said it's really having an effect it's really and they get absolutely nothing for free like everything's just so budgeted and making huge cuts and <pause dur="short"/> it's no good it's really really no good but then on the other hand you see <pause dur="short"/> the benefits if you're gonna get into all the benefit side of things</u>
<u n="142" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="143" who="S0644">I don't think it helps people <pause dur="short"/> that much either to give them stuff</u>
<u n="144" who="S0607">no I don't</u>
<u n="145" who="S0644" trans="overlap">because it it actually just apart from that's unfair as well <pause dur="short"/> on the people that are paying to for everyone else to be given enough of everything for free</u>
<u n="146" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0644" trans="overlap">at the same time it doesn't help those people if you are naturally a little bit inclined to sit on your arse</u>
<u n="148" who="S0607">oh yeah you can totally afford to</u>
<u n="149" who="S0644" trans="overlap">and then someone says here you go you don't have to work you're not going to and then</u>
<u n="150" who="S0607" trans="overlap">the worst is when <pause dur="short"/> you hear about people who could get that job but they'd be better off on benefits <pause dur="short"/> well</u>
<u n="151" who="S0644" trans="overlap">but</u>
<u n="152" who="S0607">I think the benefits should be less in that case</u>
<u n="153" who="S0644" trans="overlap">course it should <pause dur="short"/> course it should</u>
<u n="154" who="S0607" trans="overlap">for goodness sake</u>
<u n="155" who="S0644">that's the thing but that's when there's something wrong with the system and the other theory is that they're trying to do a population poll cos there are too many people</u>
<u n="156" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0644">so which I can actually believe we <unclear/></u>
<u n="158" who="S0607" trans="overlap"><unclear/> helping them</u>
<u n="159" who="S0644">well we're not so sure we don't devise these social policies but yet I can see that <pause dur="short"/> what's happening with these people that won't go don't go to work they're not educated erm <pause dur="short"/> they're all breeding like rabbits</u>
<u n="160" who="S0607" trans="overlap">god</u>
<u n="161" who="S0644">those children then have children they're all into drugs and gangs and</u>
<u n="162" who="S0607" trans="overlap"><unclear>on</unclear> benefits</u>
<u n="163" who="S0644">all getting like stabbed and and</u>
<u n="164" who="S0607">the scrotes breeding scrotes</u>
<u n="165" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="166" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="167" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh god <pause dur="short"/> but what happens is and I read this er cos I was thinking it and then I read it in an article it said like <trunc>t</trunc>there'll basically be a mass decline of population cos sooner or later if you've got there's ill health it follows suit like</u>
<u n="168" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="169" who="S0644">if you've got unemployment then there's ill health and then then there's drugs and alcoholism and all that sort of thing that goes with it and then there's gangs and it's just a means of killing people off</u>
<u n="170" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="171" who="S0644">and it's almost as if that's been facilitated by this because you cannot <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>bree</trunc> like let a a population like that breed and then there's no consequence to it</u>
<u n="172" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="173" who="S0644">but then it's all part of the theory of everything so it doesn't</u>
<u n="174" who="S0607" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0644">in the in the great scheme of things everything's all unfolding as it's going to anyway there's not that much of a difference do you see what I mean?</u>
<u n="176" who="S0607">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I was wondering back to the health thing when everybody <pause dur="short"/> everybody should have the same just go with the health not the education for now</u>
<u n="177" who="S0644" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="178" who="S0607">in order for everybody to have the same healthcare what has got to happen has the government got to make the NHS better so that nobody needs private healthcare <pause dur="short"/> because for example <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> somebody needs an urgent operation but they've got to wait three months</u>
<u n="179" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="180" who="S0607">erm if they can afford it they can oh my goodness</u>
<u n="181" who="S0644">oh wow</u>
<u n="182" who="S0607">if they can afford it they might decide to pay for it because they might survive then or no I don't know <unclear/></u>
<u n="183" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0607">erm so in order for this to stop needing to happen the government has to improve the NHS right? or</u>
<u n="185" who="S0644">I have now decided that's gonna be one of the first things I thoroughly read erm <pause dur="short"/> when I get back home because</u>

<u n="198" who="S0607">but how else could you do it? maybe you do a bit of news how how else I mean do you have to read like factual books basically? cos this might be a struggle for me</u>

<u n="207" who="S0644" trans="overlap">you do just have to read and read and read I one this lecturer that I had was really good he said about there's nothing worse than having an opinion if you don't know he said we all do it he said but there's nothing worse than having to listen to people that know a little bit about a massive subject and don't know the whole thing <unclear/> there's nothing else yeah</u>
<u n="208" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah so they rant on and on and then</u>
<u n="209" who="S0644">he said there's nothing else for it you just have to read and read and read and read and read and it's true</u>
<u n="210" who="S0607">cos it is embarrassing like if we were in the car with someone who actually knew loads of stuff sorry I don't mean that I don't mean that you <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="211" who="S0644" trans="overlap">that's usually me yeah that's usually me with <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>

<u n="215" who="S0644">yes and no right because it's a massive subject even just this right because here's the thing say <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> they're much much cleverer than I'll ever be but sometimes <pause dur="short"/> well obviously everyone's entitled to an opinion and sometimes it just comes down to how nice you are as with I said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> at one time cos we were having a heated discussion about this thing which can I tell you about it now?</u>
<u n="216" who="S0607">mm <vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm so glad cos I was worried the other day literally worried going we've forgotten all the topics and I was getting really mad that we hadn't written it down</u>

<u n="218" who="S0607">you know in <unclear/></u>
<u n="219" who="S0644" trans="overlap">this is the sort of thing that I said would happen</u>
<u n="220" who="S0607">in the middle of the night it was like but that's a whole topic <unclear/> but you should have written down every time we said it's a whole topic because</u>
<u n="221" who="S0644" trans="overlap">oh yeah we can't <unclear/> it now <unclear/> <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="222" who="S0607">now everything we've calmed down and forgotten what they all are</u>
<u n="223" who="S0644">no this is but I knew this would happen cos we'd been talking about stuff in general and then something would come up that would remind me</u>
<u n="224" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/></u>
<u n="225" who="S0644">erm <pause dur="short"/> on the subject of private healthcare I've just gotta tell you quickly cos my grandad was very very very erm socialist <pause dur="short"/> and there was a time when he was ill</u>
<u n="226" who="S0607">is that a ladybird?</u>
<u n="227" who="S0644">yeah <pause dur="short"/> anti Margaret Thatcher basically I'm sure there's more to it than that but he was very anti Margaret Thatcher anyway he erm <pause dur="short"/> was very ill and he could totally afford to have this operation but he refused on the principle he said why should I push in front of somebody who's wait waited longer? if it was me he he'd do it do you know what I mean? he would pay for it and he wouldn't think twice about it but for himself my nan always said that like if it was for somebody else he'd do it but he had his principles</u>
<u n="228" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="229" who="S0644">and he said why should I push in front of somebody who erm <pause dur="short"/> and then there was an argument that it reduces the list because there's a</u>
<u n="230" who="S0607">you're done</u>
<u n="231" who="S0644">you're done and this private one is it's been done privately so it's off the the general list</u>
<u n="232" who="S0607">I wonder how it works if in the</u>
<u n="233" who="S0644" trans="overlap">but someone said</u>
<u n="234" who="S0607">the private guy's gonna be busy no matter whether it's your grandad or some or someone else or is it that the private guy also doesn't the NHS stuff and therefore if your grandad isn't on the private no but then your grandad's still on the other list</u>
<u n="235" who="S0644">what I was gonna say</u>
<u n="236" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="237" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="238" who="S0607">but we don't know how it works do we?</u>
<u n="239" who="S0644">I've forgotten now</u>
<u n="240" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="241" who="S0644">yeah no so someone said <pause dur="short"/> that <pause dur="short"/> it takes him off that massive waiting list</u>
<u n="242" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="243" who="S0644">but then somebody else said would say do you think there's a load of surgeons sitting round like twiddling their thumbs just waiting</u>
<u n="244" who="S0607" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="245" who="S0644">for someone? like they're all taken up all the time and it's just really pushing I don't see this is why I don't know cos I've gotta find out</u>
<u n="246" who="S0607">yeah we need to find this out</u>
<u n="247" who="S0644" trans="overlap">ye<unclear/></u>
<u n="248" who="S0607">also cos I've I sort of understood that maybe it's like I'm not sure this is always the case but I know that it's sometimes the case <pause dur="short"/> that it's the same surgeon whether you're private or not</u>
<u n="249" who="S0644">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="250" who="S0607">but it but it's when you have it so you'll still be getting I don't this is probably not always the <trunc>ca</trunc> wow that <unclear>one's</unclear> better <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="251" who="S0644"><unclear/></u>
<u n="252" who="S0607">erm it's probably not always the case but I did understand sometimes that it could be the same guy so he has to divide his week between er the private and the NHS</u>
<u n="253" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah the private <unclear/></u>
<u n="254" who="S0607">on the other hand I think it could also be the case in some scenarios that if you're private <pause dur="short"/> you could insist on having the top guy</u>
<u n="255" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0607">erm and then you might have to wait again er <trunc>I</trunc>I'm not sure if that's true though whether you can say I want the top guy or</u>
<u n="257" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="258" who="S0607">even when you're private maybe you still just have whoever's going because er <trunc>th</trunc> what I don't this I don't <unclear>know</unclear> if this is a good example cos it's in Germany though but erm so with my job because we're all like European not diplomats but we're like European institution employees</u>
<u n="259" who="S0644" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="260" who="S0607">so we all have erm health coverage because we're not German so we can't have the German health thing</u>
<u n="261" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="262" who="S0607">so we have basically private</u>
<u n="263" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="264" who="S0607">erm <pause dur="short"/> but it's also Europe wide so which cos everyone's from twenty-eight different countries so you can actually be at home and still do it</u>
<u n="265" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="266" who="S0607">so I had to have this mole removed</u>
<u n="267" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="268" who="S0607">and erm I've had I'd been to all I'd been to a few different dermatologists about I can't remember what about though yeah mainly about moles</u>
<u n="269" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="270" who="S0607">so and they would just go so one dermatologist went <pause dur="short"/> so in England I'm used to having more checked</u>
<u n="271" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="272" who="S0607">and then at one time it was really it was really great on the NHS they did photos of my moles because one of the main things about melanomas is when your mole changes</u>
<u n="273" who="S0644">mm mm</u>
<u n="274" who="S0607">and if you can't really remember</u>
<u n="275" who="S0644" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="276" who="S0607">well especially on your back</u>
<u n="277" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="278" who="S0607">so took all these photos horrendous <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> never looked so <trunc>ter</trunc> I looked like a corpse</u>
<u n="279" who="S0644" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="280" who="S0607">I'd been out the night before and got drunk and I'd got spots as well and I tried to cover them up with a bit of foundation</u>
<u n="281" who="S0644" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="282" who="S0607">and this woman's got the most clearest camera ever in the world obviously</u>
<u n="283" who="S0644" trans="overlap">oh how upsetting</u>
<u n="284" who="S0607">so not only did she get the moles in in the most amazing way she also got like the pores</u>
<u n="285" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="286" who="S0607">and the the bit of foundation there and like the spot there</u>
<u n="287" who="S0644" trans="overlap">ah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="288" who="S0607">and then my toes looked like looked like an ogre and</u>
<u n="289" who="S0644" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="290" who="S0607">but anyway and that was back when I was gorgeous</u>
<u n="291" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="292" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/> so anyway so they took all these pictures and I thought that was really clever and in England nobody had ever said tell you what we're gonna remove that one it was always like we're gonna keep an eye on that one and that one I had a couple that were always a bit odd</u>
<u n="293" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="294" who="S0607">so anyway get to Germany comes to my yearly check-up time so I think right I'll <trunc>g</trunc> I'll find a dermatologist get my moles checked immediately he's like we'll remove that one and maybe that one as well <pause dur="short"/> so I was like that one? <pause dur="short"/> that one's never even been a thing like the one that they wanted to remove it's always been the dodgiest one</u>
<u n="295" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="296" who="S0607">and in fact it annoys me now cos in England they used to go given where it is we'll we'll keep going with it we'll try and not remove it whereas I actually thought later I don't give a shit what it looks like because it's here</u>
<u n="297" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="298" who="S0607">I don't know if you can see it the scar</u>
<u n="299" who="S0644">oh yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="300" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah there's hardly anything</u>
<u n="301" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="302" who="S0607">cos it was there they were like mm most people wouldn't wanna have it removed because in case there's a scar and then maybe you get married and like there's a scar and and I just sort of went along with it but I actually think if there's any doubt that that might be a melanoma just get rid of it I don't care about a <trunc>sc</trunc></u>
<u n="303" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="304" who="S0607">okay it might be different if it was on my face I dunno so anyway</u>
<u n="305" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="306" who="S0607">everyone was like this one we'll really <trunc>g</trunc> maybe we'll check this one every six months sort of thing get to Germany we're having that off</u>
<u n="307" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="308" who="S0607">but we're also having this one off this random one on my leg so I knew</u>
<u n="309" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="310" who="S0607">already I knew something was up now there's a problem with this private insurance that we had at work which is that if because you're privately covered they do more things than what you need and it's terrible terrible terrible so they'll be like oh you've got a cough? we'd better take some blood and do some tests</u>
<u n="311" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="312" who="S0607">and then it costs like three hundred and fifty euros which your private insurance pays for</u>
<u n="313" who="S0644" trans="overlap">has paid for</u>
<u n="314" who="S0607">erm and at first you don't realise cos you're new and you kind of like go oh we need to do a blood test bloody hell</u>
<u n="315" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="316" who="S0607">erm then the third time you're like you need to take more blood?</u>
<u n="317" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="318" who="S0607">no you don't so I started saying</u>
<u n="319" who="S0644" trans="overlap">rip off</u>
<u n="320" who="S0607">I've already had blood taken two months ago so I'll get you the results of that then I would just forget erm so the point being I've got to try and like hurry up the point being that so I I knew something was odd about that mole because the one on my leg did not it was like a totally normal mole</u>
<u n="321" who="S0644">right</u>
<u n="322" who="S0607">so I went to a second dermatologist</u>
<u n="323" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="324" who="S0607">to get a second opinion</u>
<u n="325" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="326" who="S0607">and he screwed me over as well</u>
<u n="327" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="328" who="S0607">but I was stupid cos I went in going I need a second opinion cos I'm pretty sure I'm being screwed over but I shouldn't have done that I'm so stupid</u>
<u n="329" who="S0644" trans="overlap">why?</u>
<u n="330" who="S0607">I should have gone in just <trunc>t</trunc> and not told him anything cos he was like</u>
<u n="331" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="332" who="S0607">oh really? who's screwing you over?</u>
<u n="333" who="S0644" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="334" who="S0607">and he's desperate for me to tell him the name and being a I'm really disappointed with myself because I didn't hadn't done done my assertiveness course so I didn't know to pause and think</u>
<u n="335" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="336" who="S0607">I just said the name and I didn't wanna tell him the name</u>
<u n="337" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="338" who="S0607">cos this guy was clearly an arsehole and he was rubbing his hands with glee</u>
<u n="339" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="340" who="S0607">going erm and was his English not very good?</u>
<u n="341" who="S0644" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="342" who="S0607">you know and all this stuff so anyway this guy when I got my bill</u>
<u n="343" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0607">erm so he I can't remember what he'd said now about the moles because it all got overtaken by the fact that he sent me a bill and on it was this thing saying took cultures and sent to lab well he didn't</u>
<u n="345" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="346" who="S0607">he never took any cultures so I called up going what cultures? you didn't do any cultures and and he was really awkward on the phone so anyway</u>
<u n="347" who="S0644" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="348" who="S0607">I was like right now I'm totally screwed so do you know what I did? I remembered that the dermatologist that I'd seen in England</u>
<u n="349" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0607">was German</u>
<u n="351" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="352" who="S0607">so I actually called him my mum was a bit like oh don't bother him but I called him and I said listen Dr <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="353" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="354" who="S0607">I'm in Germany now <pause dur="short"/> and I just can't seem to get anybody trustworthy</u>
<u n="355" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="356" who="S0607">what would you do? and he said well at first he was a bit like <vocal desc="sigh"/> cos these er Dr <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> has told my mum that he's gonna have to retire early cos he's so stressed so you can imagine the sort of</u>
<u n="357" who="S0644" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="358" who="S0607">am I in the am I in the am I in the right bit of the road?</u>
<u n="359" who="S0644">oh</u>
<u n="360" who="S0607">get onto that lane as soon as I can <pause dur="short"/> I think it was one of those where it like yeah</u>
<u n="361" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah you were actually but</u>
<u n="362" who="S0607"><vocal desc="misc"/> erm</u>
<u n="363" who="S0644">it's a bit tricky that weren't it?</u>
<u n="364" who="S0607">so he was a bit like stressed out but then he said look I don't know any dermatologists in Frankfurt but there's one thing I do know is that if I was in Germany I would go to the university hospital</u>
<u n="365" who="S0644">yes</u>
<u n="366" who="S0607">so I was like oh Dr <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> you have really helped me cos he was like I would say that they are reliable so after that I always went so by by this time I've been to two dermatologists my private health never said anything about all these like opinions</u>
<u n="367" who="S0644">mm mm mm mm</u>
<u n="368" who="S0607">went to the proper hospital and they did indeed remove that mole erm <pause dur="short"/> but I just suddenly felt like I was being seen by cos this university hospital I'm not really sure how it works but it feels a bit more <trunc>l</trunc> a bit more like NHS where they're really busy and they're not gonna remove it if you don't need it</u>
<u n="369" who="S0644" trans="overlap">can I just tell you? <pause dur="short"/> this is what the problem is when you've got private because all of a sudden there's a buck to be made <pause dur="short"/> and then</u>
<u n="370" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah but you see I never had I never thought that before I went to Germany</u>
<u n="371" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="372" who="S0607">it was like as if <unclear>our</unclear> <anon type="place"/> people were like you could see us coming ten miles off I I don't know how to explain it</u>
<u n="373" who="S0644" trans="overlap">yeah that that's probably cos you there's this huge private erm</u>
<u n="374" who="S0607">but do you know what the key thing is? you don't have to be referred</u>
<u n="375" who="S0644">you can just go?</u>
<u n="376" who="S0607" trans="overlap">you can just bugger off to any specialist you want whereas in England it's really good you have to be referred even if you want to go private</u>
<u n="377" who="S0644" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm mm</u>
<u n="378" who="S0607">so you can't just be having loads of things do</u>
<u n="379" who="S0644" trans="overlap">turn up</u>
<u n="380" who="S0607">and I just believe I really believe this and it's not just because I'm biased against Germany</u>
<u n="381" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="382" who="S0607">I really believe from my experience</u>
<u n="383" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="384" who="S0607">cos I have done had some private things done in England cos I've had several jobs with private stuff</u>
<u n="385" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="386" who="S0607">I really believe they don't do it if it doesn't need doing whereas in Germany</u>
<u n="387" who="S0644" trans="overlap">mm they <unclear/></u>
<u n="388" who="S0607">I've talked to a lot of people and we and we came to the consensus that <pause dur="short"/> usually blood test things</u>
<u n="389" who="S0644">yeah</u>
<u n="390" who="S0607">erm they they will do it unnecessarily and I find that to be so horrendous</u>
<u n="391" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="392" who="S0607">and and I genuinely don't think it happens in England now of course it might happen sometimes but I think we've got a really good system cos you have to be referred so you</u>

<u n="407" who="S0644">mm</u>
<u n="408" who="S0607">and I think it's really outrageous but anyway so I ended up at the university hospital it felt much more like NHS type place</u>

<u n="423" who="S0644">but that that's what I think is half the problem when there's money involved with things</u>
<u n="424" who="S0607">yes</u>
<u n="425" who="S0644"><unclear/> it just like anything like once you start introducing a buck to be made but then <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/></u>

<u n="618" who="S0607">a picture of the <anon type="place"/> bridge <trunc>becau</trunc> but I think the one I saw was at a different place I I can remember the name if I think hard enough <pause dur="short"/> it was somewhere else <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="619" who="S0644">oh look</u>
<u n="620" who="S0607">exciting <pause dur="long"/></u>

<u n="622" who="S0607">is it too much of a pain for you to carry on telling me because now we're on high alert?</u>
<u n="623" who="S0644">oh what for? erm sorry no I will cut to the chase of this of this erm story <pause dur="short"/> right so <pause dur="short"/> man comes in <pause dur="short"/> and it transpires that this man the ogler is a translator</u>
<u n="624" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="625" who="S0644">and it's <trunc>h</trunc>horrible <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> but I have to tell you it was it was a rape case or an attempted rape case</u>
<u n="626" who="S0607" trans="overlap">oh no oh no</u>
<u n="627" who="S0644">and the solicitor <pause dur="short"/> god</u>
<u n="628" who="S0607">yeah don't look</u>
<u n="629" who="S0644"><vocal desc="laugh"/> so I'm listening to it all and it was horrible and erm <pause dur="short"/> the solicitor was asking questions <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> without going into too much detail <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> I deduced <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="630" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="631" who="S0644">from this fact <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> hang on <pause dur="short"/> so the way the bloke was talking about it <pause dur="short"/> the solicitor got him and it there was no question of him not understanding cos the <trunc>s</trunc> the translator was there</u>
<u n="632" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="633" who="S0644">so there's no question of him not understanding properly and the solicitor was so good and it made me think about how if you are a solicitor you have to be <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> me and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> were talking about it after and it's a battle of wits like you can't lose your temper</u>
<u n="634" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="635" who="S0644">you can't start calling names</u>
<u n="636" who="S0607">you just have to be clever</u>
<u n="637" who="S0644">you have to be very very clever keep your cool at the same time maintaining a tone that lets you <pause dur="short"/> lets them know what you think of them basically cos you're you're trying to prosecute them</u>
<u n="638" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="639" who="S0644">erm <pause dur="short"/> and it's so is this true? and is that true? and in the end and the bloke what it really really seemed to me like was like he was trying to make out he didn't understand but he couldn't do that cos he had the translator</u>
<u n="640" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="641" who="S0644">and it made me think <pause dur="short"/> do people do that a lot? like pretend that they don't <pause dur="short"/> understand</u>
<u n="642" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="643" who="S0644"><vocal desc="sigh"/> anyway erm <pause dur="short"/> it came down to some details about something because what they were trying to do was <pause dur="short"/> escalate his charge from sexual assault to attempted rape which is obviously more serious and they get longer</u>
<u n="644" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="645" who="S0644">for it and plus it it was that by the sound of it totally was so that's what they were trying to get him done for</u>
<u n="646" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="647" who="S0644">erm <pause dur="short"/> and the bloke was asking him the questions <pause dur="short"/> and in the end he he said something like cos the translator was was erm <pause dur="short"/> <unclear/> he was speaking it all the bloke was talking but obviously the translator was <unclear/></u>
<u n="648" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="649" who="S0644">the translator at one point he said take it alright assaulted her I sexually assaulted her take it take it in other words he was like I'm fed up with the questioning yeah I did it alright he he was he was so and he had this look on him of like <pause dur="short"/> the whole time</u>
<u n="650" who="S0607" trans="overlap">bloke the bloke</u>
<u n="651" who="S0644">the the one who'd been charged</u>
<u n="652" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="653" who="S0644">yeah he had this look on him that was like you know when you've you've been <trunc>a</trunc>accused of something and you've done it and you don't <unclear/> and then you look pissed off cos you've been caught</u>
<u n="654" who="S0607" trans="overlap">you just yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="655" who="S0644">it was like that now I thought if someone had charged me with doing something that I haven't done I would be looking the whole time at the he wouldn't he didn't really wanna look at the the solicitor he wouldn't look at him erm and he was just very</u>
<u n="656" who="S0607" trans="overlap">and you would be you would be like</u>
<u n="657" who="S0644">no this happened no that happened</u>
<u n="658" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="659" who="S0644">no and I know that cos I've been in court plenty of times</u>
<u n="660" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="661" who="S0644">so you can't use that as a as in <pause dur="short"/> he's intimidated by the the you know what I mean? like he</u>
<u n="662" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="663" who="S0644">I dunno I dunno <pause dur="short"/> so if you haven't done something and this again comes down to <pause dur="short"/> vibrations a bit</u>
<u n="664" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="665" who="S0644">because I just thought his whole demeanour is is guilty</u>
<u n="666" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="667" who="S0644">and isn't that a bit like <trunc>some</trunc> you can't trust that cos that's just your interpretation of their demeanour you can't judge people based on you think oh yeah he's done it <pause dur="short"/> but</u>
<u n="668" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="669" who="S0644">people if you can't look at someone <pause dur="short"/> there is a reason why you can't like body language has been studied to</u>
<u n="670" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="671" who="S0644">show that it it happens for a reason it it's based on <unclear/> I can't stick to one subject ah</u>
<u n="672" who="S0607"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="673" who="S0644">but so the bottom line of it was <pause dur="short"/> and the <trunc>solic</trunc> so it seemed to me like he's going yeah whatever I did it I did it I'm fed up with being questioned you know like how you would say if you were guilty been found out guilty</u>
<u n="674" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="675" who="S0644">and then you you <pause dur="short"/> just feel like having a tantrum basically he was horrible he was horrible he was horrible</u>
<u n="676" who="S0607" trans="overlap">ah</u>
<u n="677" who="S0644">and the story was so poor like his and it there was no chance of it being misinterpreted because he had the translator there was no chance of</u>
<u n="678" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="679" who="S0644">maybe it's lost in translation</u>
<u n="680" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="681" who="S0644" trans="overlap">cos he had this this translator who was there now <pause dur="short"/> erm apart from the rest of the issues that are about this I said to the girls when we were talking about it I said I think that's a cultural thing because <pause dur="short"/> I said <pause dur="short"/> oh that was it at one point he said something stupid like <pause dur="short"/> erm I do <trunc>ha</trunc> I <pause dur="short"/> I have a mother I have sister or something something like that as in</u>
<u n="682" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="683" who="S0644">as if he felt like by saying that he was gonna get himself some erm</u>
<u n="684" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="685" who="S0644">leeway by saying that as if you could just say that it as if he was</u>
<u n="686" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="687" who="S0644">it mattered so little really <pause dur="short"/> but if I at least pretend to show a bit of remorse then people will buy it</u>
<u n="688" who="S0607" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="689" who="S0644">and then that's good enough for my country that's what it seemed like so I think he was middle eastern</u>
<u n="690" who="S0607">mm</u>
<u n="691" who="S0644">by the lingo <pause dur="short"/> and I thought to myself I think <pause dur="short"/> that it's things like that can be cultural as well as just being an arsehole</u>
<u n="692" who="S0607">yeah</u>
<u n="693" who="S0644">it's a cultural thing where that's just a little bit more acceptable</u>
<u n="694" who="S0607">yeah</u>
