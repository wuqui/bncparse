<u n="88" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I was playing guitar and <pause dur="short"/> I couldn't get any audio at all <pause dur="short"/> and then I <trunc>th</trunc> so I thought oh great now I can't even get any audio <unclear>it's like</unclear> first of all it was the midi that I couldn't get now I can't get anything <pause dur="short"/> but I figured out I'd just change some settings so that's okay I've got that working again</u>
<u n="89" who="S0024"><unclear>oh</unclear></u>
<u n="90" who="S0144">and then I've tried everything I've been troubleshooting I've been reading all the guides for Logic <vocal desc="sigh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="91" who="S0024"><unclear>when was that?</unclear></u>
<u n="92" who="S0144">looking at all these help pages and I've written to people and</u>
<u n="93" who="S0024">have you written to the help people there?</u>
<u n="94" who="S0144">no <trunc>n</trunc> I downloaded the</u>
<u n="95" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I'm sure they'd be good cos <unclear>the service that they</unclear></u>
<u n="96" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <trunc>may</trunc> I've registered with them</u>
<u n="97" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="98" who="S0144">erm <pause dur="short"/> and I downloaded the drivers for my keyboard</u>
<u n="99" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="100" who="S0144">like the up-to-date ones</u>
<u n="101" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="102" who="S0144">that's made no difference <pause dur="short"/> cos the power's definitely working the lights are coming on on the keyboard <pause dur="short"/> and occasionally I can get sound but then it just goes off randomly</u>
<u n="103" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="104" who="S0144">so I mean it's an old keyboard if if you think I got it in <anon type="place"/> in what two thousand and seven</u>
<u n="105" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah I know but it should still work <unclear>should be</unclear> fine</u>
<u n="106" who="S0144" trans="overlap">it's like <pause dur="short"/> seven years old it's quite a long</u>
<u n="107" who="S0024">yeah but</u>
<u n="108" who="S0144" trans="overlap">quite old in <pause dur="short"/> technological terms isn't it?</u>
<u n="109" who="S0024">but it's only a keyboard</u>
<u n="110" who="S0144">but it works on my PC</u>
<u n="111" who="S0024">it's only a keyboard what more <trunc>d</trunc> what advances could it have made?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0144">erm</u>
<u n="113" who="S0024">it's still</u>
<u n="114" who="S0144">well I dunno but I download</u>
<u n="115" who="S0024">it's</u>
<u n="116" who="S0144">this other thing <pause dur="short"/> to that checks basically checks your midi input</u>
<u n="117" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="118" who="S0144">and I've got no signal coming through <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> so that's the problem</u>
<u n="119" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0144">so either I think the power's not sufficient in the cable <pause dur="short"/> or it's an old keyboard and it's it's just not recognised by Logic</u>
<u n="121" who="S0024">well that would be silly I think because</u>
<u n="122" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="123" who="S0024">it's still USB and it's still a keyboard</u>
<u n="124" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="125" who="S0024">all of the jazzy stuff you do on a computer so there's no need for it to be updated in any way</u>
<u n="126" who="S0144">well no</u>
<u n="127" who="S0024" trans="overlap">just a <trunc>key</trunc></u>
<u n="128" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well no no if you look at all the <trunc>n</trunc> latest midi keyboards they all <pause dur="short"/> they've got a load of pads on them and</u>
<u n="129" who="S0024">have you got</u>
<u n="130" who="S0144">loads of knobs</u>
<u n="131" who="S0024">but you do all of that on the computer so there's no need for that</u>
<u n="132" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but I was just er texting <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> and he's got a midi keyboard and I just asked him has he got a <pause dur="short"/> is it USB to USB or is it midi out to USB? he's got a midi out to USB <pause dur="short"/> I've got USB to USB <pause dur="short"/> so if I can use his cable</u>
<u n="133" who="S0024">maybe</u>
<u n="134" who="S0144">from the midi out socket which I have</u>
<u n="135" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="136" who="S0144">to USB maybe that will be the problem</u>
<u n="137" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0144">cos I don't know if that has a different power</u>
<u n="139" who="S0024">but then you can buy the cable</u>
<u n="140" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but if that doesn't work then I think I need to buy a new midi keyboard</u>
<u n="141" who="S0024"><event desc="sound of choking"/> woo <pause dur="short"/> I choked</u>
<u n="142" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> cos I can use the the keyboard that is on the computer</u>
<u n="143" who="S0024">no no you don't wanna do that</u>
<u n="144" who="S0144" trans="overlap">but it's it's crap</u>
<u n="145" who="S0024">there's no point in doing that cos you won't learn how to play a keyboard</u>
<u n="146" who="S0144">no</u>
<u n="147" who="S0024">it's just pointless pressing A B C <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> no no you won't be able to pick that up <unclear>it won't be worth it</unclear></u>
<u n="148" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah I know <pause dur="short"/> no cos I want the different octaves as well I don't wanna</u>
<u n="149" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0144">just play one octave</u>
<u n="151" who="S0024">no <unclear>it's not worth</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> that would be rubbish <pause dur="short"/> well I hope it works cos I don't really see the point of buying a new keyboard unless it's a</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="152" who="S0144">well it's annoying cos it works on the PC</u>
<u n="153" who="S0024" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="154" who="S0144">it's just on the Mac</u>
<u n="155" who="S0024">maybe it's the Mac that needs the erm midi output</u>
<u n="156" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="157" who="S0144">that's what I'm thinking <pause dur="short"/> I think that's <pause dur="short"/> seriously I think that's the last thing I can try</u>
<u n="158" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<event desc="sound of baby"/>
<u n="159" who="S0144">I've tried everything else <pause dur="short"/> unless I'm just being a complete dumb-ass and doing the wrong settings on Logic</u>
<u n="160" who="S0024">ooh</u>
<u n="161" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I don't think I am because that test I had no <trunc>sigul</trunc>signal coming through</u>
<u n="162" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="163" who="S0144">when I was pressing the keys so <pause dur="short"/> that's that <pause dur="short"/> but that's what I've been doing all day <pause dur="short"/> and all day yesterday</u>
<u n="164" who="S0024">well you better stop doing it</u>
<u n="165" who="S0144">well yeah I am cos my head</u>
<u n="166" who="S0024" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="167" who="S0144">you know when you've been staring at a computer all day?</u>

<u n="169" who="S0144">my head's fucked</u>
<u n="170" who="S0024">yeah I'd give it a break for a few days <pause dur="short"/> give it a break</u>
<u n="171" who="S0144">I just wanna get started with it</u>
<u n="172" who="S0024"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> you could start by doing guitar things and drumming things <pause dur="short"/> and look and learn and making <pause dur="short"/> you know you don't have to start with a keyboard do you?</u>
<u n="173" who="S0144">well with the drum you need the keyboard</u>
<u n="174" who="S0024">why?</u>
<u n="175" who="S0144">if you're making your own beats <pause dur="short"/> you're assigning</u>
<u n="176" who="S0024" trans="overlap"><unclear>why aren't</unclear> you're gonna record your drum and then put it on there?</u>
<u n="177" who="S0144">oh <pause dur="short"/> erm I I don't know yet</u>
<u n="178" who="S0024">I thought that's what it was for</u>
<u n="179" who="S0144">yeah but then if I recorded my own drum <pause dur="short"/> that's gonna be a loop</u>
<u n="180" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well just make loads of different loops</u>
<u n="181" who="S0144">no but it's difficult to quantise it</u>
<u n="182" who="S0024">but I thought the whole idea was to have your unique style of drumming</u>
<u n="183" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="184" who="S0024">recorded and made in</u>
<u n="185" who="S0144">no I am gonna get to that but I can't start with that because I need to learn how how it all works</u>
<u n="186" who="S0024" trans="overlap">oh okay <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>just do <trunc>di</trunc>?</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh</u>

<u n="189" who="S0144">figure out</u>
<u n="190" who="S0024">you should do the chords</u>
