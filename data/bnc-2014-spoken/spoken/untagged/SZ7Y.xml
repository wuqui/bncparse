<u n="308" who="S0041">erm and it was like a swoon moment you know like in one of those teen films and it was like oh and then I was  then I had him and his best friend fighting over me and I was like ooh ooh ooh</u>
<u n="309" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> I love it when that happens</u>
<u n="310" who="S0041">then we went into sixth-form and they all stayed friends with me and then there was three of them all at it as well and I used to <unclear/> games teacher and they they were all taking me out for drinks</u>
<u n="311" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="312" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I mean it took like it's it's a nice feeling some of it took months of years and years of being taken the <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> out of because my friends were boys <pause dur="short"/> but like some of them if they found out that I'd fancied them then it wasn't nice like it wasn't oh wow <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> fancies me it was like weird cos my friend fancies me <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="313" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="314" who="S0041">and I remember this guy called Tom Stanton and the worst insult I ever got was we were in year nine and he found out that I fancied him and he was saying it to <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> which was the worst thing cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> like told him to shut up when he said it <pause dur="short"/> but he said she's got a face like a bulldog bulldog chewing a wasp <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="315" who="S0084">but boys at that age are <trunc>s</trunc> are cruel you know they say stuff not because they mean it but because they want to be cruel <trunc>a</trunc> and make their mates laugh do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="316" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="317" who="S0084">like he's it's that age and I think the thing is the what the the thing that worries me when about that story is that you now marry the two things so you marry losing all that weight and the boys fancying you and I think probably what actually happened</u>
<u n="318" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="319" who="S0084">was you lost the weight gained confidence and that's what boys find attractive <pause dur="short"/> like they don't I don't think it's anything to do with the size that you are</u>
<u n="320" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="321" who="S0084">and I think you're very self-conscious</u>
<u n="322" who="S0041">probably not</u>
<u n="323" who="S0084">about that <pause dur="short"/> but actually boys are and girls you're attracted to somebody who is confident about themselves and it doesn't really matter what size they are what their face looks like what their skin looks like <pause dur="short"/> ultimately if they're confident in their own skin that's a really attractive quality</u>
<u n="324" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="325" who="S0084">I think actually like if you look in the mirror now you are no you're a stunning girl and you get <pause dur="short"/> if you think about it <trunc>e</trunc> even just with your photo up on Plenty of Fish that you're getting you've got messages from really attractive blokes aren't you? I mean you get</u>
<u n="326" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="327" who="S0084">approached by attractive blokes in clubs and if you think about all the the boys that you've had interest from they've all been attractive <pause dur="short"/> like you can't really think that you're not attractive</u>
<u n="328" who="S0041">but do you know what I think it is I think it's er a case of what's the word for it? I can't remember the name of it like say girls that weren't pretty at school develop a personality to me if they</u>
<u n="329" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="330" who="S0041">weren't pretty at school then now you might still be pretty but you're thick you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="331" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="332" who="S0041">A little bit of an airhead there's not much up here? I think it's probably a bit of a like a marrying of both <pause dur="short"/> but even though that's one comment that sticks in my head from school</u>
<u n="333" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="334" who="S0041">I see him now and I think why the hell did you even like him?</u>

<u n="340" who="S0041">telling <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> that I'm going back so he'll be so excited to see me <pause dur="short"/> just to wipe it in their faces</u>
<u n="341" who="S0084">mm mm</u>
<u n="342" who="S0041">like you know just for that <pause dur="short"/> I mean people I don't even care and he probably doesn't they probably don't even remember saying it</u>
<u n="343" who="S0084">no well that's the thing cos it's those sorts of comments to those sorts of people are just throwaway <pause dur="short"/> it but it's to you that it sticks</u>
<u n="344" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="345" who="S0084">you know the stuff that you get called when you're at school like that's why I would never go back to school ever ever <pause dur="short"/> you know if I  if I  could have my time again I would never go back because those last two years were so painful <pause dur="short"/> but I think everybody experiences some level of torment at some point and I I think there's very few people who don't <pause dur="short"/> but erm I the stuff that kids used to say to me will never factor in their mind so they would never look back and think God</u>
<u n="346" who="S0041">remember when I said that</u>
<u n="347" who="S0084">I was a bit of an arse <pause dur="short"/> whereas I look back and I think sometimes God I was really cruel to other people because I was suffering myself and so I was mean to other people because it's all a social system so you're being shat on from on high so you take it out on somebody else</u>
<u n="348" who="S0041" trans="overlap">shit on someone else yeah</u>
<u n="349" who="S0084">which is really it's I mean that's when you learn that's not acceptable behaviour but you're in all likelihood you're not in contact with those people anymore so you can't really make amends <pause dur="short"/> it's like my name is  isn't it? It goes back and makes <unclear/> it's always done and I quite like that idea like you learn that that's not really acceptable behaviour</u>
<u n="350" who="S0041" trans="overlap">do you know even if I really think hard I can't remember many girls that I was nasty about <pause dur="short"/> I can't really think of any <pause dur="short"/> I remember saying <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> looked like a man but she was going to <unclear/> so I think that kind of counts</u>

<u n="686" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="687" who="S0041">erm and obviously he's too proud to accept it but we were on about going up to <anon type="place"/> at er <anon type="place"/> next weekend so that she can <trunc>off</trunc> like take her cheque book basically <pause dur="short"/> so I said to her when I saw her at the weekend and I said I I know it sounds really really really sad but I can only <trunc>s</trunc> if anything like this would happen or anything would happen when he needs something I'd be financially able to provide for him like he's always</u>
<u n="688" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="689" who="S0041">provided for me <pause dur="short"/> and it's just I hate that it's kind of happened five ten years before that table has turned enough for me to be able to do it</u>
<u n="690" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="691" who="S0041" trans="overlap">you know had this happened twenty years ago in time clocks back</u>
<u n="692" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="693" who="S0041">then twenty-five would be a suitable age to be expected to have a family home and be financially well off</u>
<u n="694" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="695" who="S0041">and I just feel so bad that I can't help him</u>
<u n="696" who="S0084">but there's the thing you would never expect it do you know what I mean like?</u>
<u n="697" who="S0041" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="698" who="S0084">you would never <pause dur="short"/> I think even when you you are in that position your parents never see it they never would imagine</u>
<u n="699" who="S0041">no</u>
<u n="700" who="S0084">that that's</u>
<u n="701" who="S0041">like you weren't even told stuff now</u>
<u n="702" who="S0084">what they were doing <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="703" who="S0041">at all</u>
<u n="704" who="S0084" trans="overlap">but I mean it it's such a fine balance though isn't it? Because like with my mum I often find that there's stuff that I know that she's holding back and I think on the one hand I'd quite like her to tell me or or at least feel she's able to tell me <pause dur="short"/> but at the same time I can appreciate why she might not want to <pause dur="short"/> you know ultimately you have to keep that parent child bond and keep that distance because you know she's got friends she can talk to about stuff just as I have and there are certain things I wouldn't talk to her about probably <pause dur="short"/> so erm so yeah it's</u>
<u n="705" who="S0041" trans="overlap">it's a fine line isn't it?</u>
<u n="706" who="S0084">it's a really fine line and you know you want to be there as a support for your parents when you're an adult but you know that I think that basically you expect that they're always gonna be the person to provide</u>
<u n="707" who="S0041">mm</u>
<u n="708" who="S0084">no matter what</u>
<u n="709" who="S0041">even if they don't want to</u>
<u n="710" who="S0084">yeah and like with my dad my dad's really proud and and my older brother is pretty well off financially because obviously like he bought my dad a a super deluxe lovely TV for Christmas and never comes to visit us but that's they don't <pause dur="short"/> but but I know that my my dad wants to be the one to pay for dinner he wants to be able to get the drinks but actually you know he he's retired and Michael's got quite a good income it should be Michael that pays <pause dur="short"/> just as you know it would be me that would do it <pause dur="short"/> but I think it's different because I live here so I sort of take it all for granted</u>
<u n="711" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="712" who="S0084">sort of back back to that oh it's so easy I'm just here for a cup of tea or whatever</u>
<u n="713" who="S0041">yeah</u>
<u n="714" who="S0084">whereas I think if you came for a visit it makes it into a bigger deal</u>
<u n="715" who="S0041">yeah definitely</u>
<u n="716" who="S0084">but I suppose because they see each other less frequently</u>
<u n="717" who="S0041">yeah <pause dur="short"/> like dad won't let me pay for anything at all <pause dur="short"/> nothing</u>
<u n="718" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="719" who="S0041">and like when he  when he  came before ordinarily I would have paid for dinner and and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> knew that how broke I was this month</u>
<u n="720" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="721" who="S0041">with the car and everything <pause dur="short"/> and she secretly gave me forty pound cash and she said say you're paying for dinner cos he won't let me pay for it again</u>
<u n="722" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="723" who="S0041">because <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had paid for his meal</u>
<u n="724" who="S0084">okay</u>
<u n="725" who="S0041">so I paid for it erm and gave it to the guy at the counter and dad was stood there and I said do you want to take your coffees over and I'll wait for the third one? And he said Oh no it's okay and the guy came over because I'd distracted dad I was quick enough to give him the forty pound cash for a thirty-nine pound bill that <unclear/></u>
<u n="726" who="S0084">nice</u>
<u n="727" who="S0041">erm and he said what are you doing? and I said I'm paying for the dinner and he said well no cos I'll pay for dinner <pause dur="short"/> and I said no stop it because you always pay for everything and I just want to pay for one thing <pause dur="short"/> knowing that I was actually really paying for it</u>
<u n="728" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="729" who="S0041">erm and I said just say thank you and let me pay for just one thing out of everything please <pause dur="short"/> and he was like okay then and that's only because erm we'd left the antiques place and I'd chosen this erm and I was going to buy it for myself <pause dur="short"/> and he said oh I'll get it for your birthday and I said oh you know I think do you not think sixty pound is a bit excessive for a birthday present really? I said but why don't we go halves then because I would have bought it for myself anyway? no no no I'll pay for it and I said well I I feel a bit uncomfortable actually if you pay pay that much for a birthday gift <pause dur="short"/> I I would really appreciate it you'd just let me pay half cos I just think that's a bit</u>
<u n="730" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="731" who="S0041">it's a bit ridiculous <pause dur="short"/> no he wouldn't have any of it he just won't  he just won't  have it</u>
<u n="732" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="733" who="S0041">even if even something that he he that I was going to pay for myself because I've had the cash for</u>
<u n="734" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="735" who="S0041">he wouldn't have it <pause dur="short"/> before he left he gave me forty quid cash for er dinner even though I knew he doesn't have that money</u>
<u n="736" who="S0084">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="737" who="S0041">he doesn't have it</u>
<u n="738" who="S0084">yeah</u>
<u n="739" who="S0041">and he came into my room before he left and I was just writing him an Easter card to put in his case to say thank you erm for coming down <pause dur="short"/> and he put the forty pound in my case and the the killer is I know he can't afford it because ordinarily he would have left sixty</u>
<u n="740" who="S0084">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="741" who="S0041">do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="742" who="S0084">mm</u>
<u n="743" who="S0041">he would have paid he would have left more money so I know he's skint and I know he's telling <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> that he's down to his last three hundred pound in the world</u>
<u n="744" who="S0084">God</u>
<u n="745" who="S0041">yeah he's really really</u>
<u n="746" who="S0084">he still wanted</u>

<u n="764" who="S0084">right</u>
<u n="765" who="S0041">and he had to do work on one of the houses in order to re-let it so he'd got crap loads coming out of a pot for Christmas so the mortgage payment was three weeks late</u>
