<u n="1" who="S0370">yeah somebody must make we need to search on the whole web</u>
<u n="2" who="S0012">we do</u>
<u n="3" who="S0370">now we know what we're asking for it's a one inch two three no three quarter to one inch adapter</u>
<u n="4" who="S0012">yeah three quarter female</u>
<u n="5" who="S0370">well I think if you put three quarter to one inch adapter it will pick it up won't it?</u>
<u n="6" who="S0012">yeah but you got to know the how many threads it is</u>
<u n="7" who="S0370">the lathe well the lathes are all the same aren't they?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0012">I dunno</u>
<u n="9" who="S0370">I would have though they were the same</u>
<u n="10" who="S0012">yeah yeah yeah they probably would be</u>
<u n="11" who="S0370">they're probably all the same</u>
<u n="12" who="S0013">it should be standard shouldn't they?</u>
<u n="13" who="S0370">yeah so its proper cream cheese here</u>
<u n="14" who="S0012">oh yeah</u>
<u n="15" who="S0370">and you haven't opened it?</u>
<u n="16" who="S0013">that's alright I'll finish off the old one</u>
<u n="17" who="S0370">why do you buy? oh I'll use that one</u>
<u n="18" who="S0013">no it's alright</u>
<u n="19" who="S0370">do you buy Philadelphia rather than?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0012">when it's cheap</u>
<u n="21" who="S0370">when it's cheap? which it is sometimes actually</u>
<u n="22" who="S0013">it was half price</u>
<u n="23" who="S0012">it was half price</u>
<u n="24" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="25" who="S0370">was it? why do they do that do you know I?</u>
<u n="26" who="S0013">I don't know the the the last it's to get the rid of the stock isn't it? that's the idea</u>
<u n="27" who="S0370">oh it's getting near out of date</u>
<u n="28" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0370">so they want to clear it up that's what it is yeah</u>
<u n="30" who="S0013">they can't keep it there forever <pause dur="short"/></u>
<u n="31" who="S0370">but but to actually do it as a promotion they must have a lot of stock</u>
<u n="32" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0012">they must do</u>
<u n="34" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="35" who="S0370">but I suppose they must have a lot of stock when you think of Tesco's as a whole</u>
<u n="36" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0370">they must have oodles of stock</u>
<u n="38" who="S0013">they must do yeah such a difficult thing to do isn't it? stock up a supermarket really hard work it must be</u>
<u n="39" who="S0370">well</u>
<u n="40" who="S0013">I don't like it</u>
<u n="41" who="S0370">I reckon practically all of its computerised now</u>
<u n="42" who="S0012">this is out of date next month</u>
<u n="43" who="S0013">oh I see so that when you go through the checkout they know before</u>
<u n="44" who="S0012">that's February January February</u>
<u n="45" who="S0370">well you've got a Tesco's card haven't you?</u>
<u n="46" who="S0012">this is seventeenth of the fourth</u>
<u n="47" who="S0013">I think mm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0012">yeah so it's</u>
<u n="49" who="S0013">that's April</u>
<u n="50" who="S0012">yeah but it's ain't near nearly out of date is it?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0370">that depends how many they've got</u>
<u n="52" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0370">cos at at the checkout it also it also cos you use your card your Tesco card it knows your shopping pattern</u>
<u n="54" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="55" who="S0370">so it knows that you buy Philadelphia in June and July</u>
<u n="56" who="S0013">clever oh yeah I suppose they do</u>
<u n="57" who="S0370">yeah</u>
<u n="58" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="59" who="S0370">so it knows when you shop at <anon type="place"/> Tesco's so it knows how much <anon type="place"/> Tesco's needs in June and July</u>
<u n="60" who="S0012">that's right to accommodate us</u>
<u n="61" who="S0370">yeah and if you stop shopping there you'll come off that <unclear/> database so you're</u>
<u n="62" who="S0370">so I'm guessing they've got quite sophisticated computerised stock control</u>
<u n="63" who="S0013">yeah I guess they must have</u>
<u n="64" who="S0370">so I doubt that they would if that's effective then they're not going to have loads of stock lots of stock that's near its sell-by date</u>
<u n="65" who="S0013">but when it comes to like seasons like like today Valentine's day</u>
<u n="66" who="S0370">yeah</u>
<u n="67" who="S0013">they've had to bring in loads and loads of flowers haven't they? red roses and things</u>
<u n="68" who="S0370">mm well they know what they sold last year</u>
<u n="69" who="S0013">they do but they don't know if Tesco's is doing a better deal than Morrison's or whatever</u>
<u n="70" who="S0370">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0013">or Lidl even</u>
<u n="72" who="S0370">yeah</u>
<u n="73" who="S0013">it's difficult isn't it? cos they're all trying to fight they all think they're gonna sell loads but it doesn't really mean that</u>
<u n="74" who="S0012">the buyers have a heck of a job don't they?</u>
<u n="75" who="S0013">they do don't they? it must be difficult</u>
<u n="76" who="S0012">and if you're a good buyer then you're worth a lot of money at Tesco's or Morrison's</u>
<u n="77" who="S0013">if you sell at the right price</u>
<u n="78" who="S0012">but they must be I <trunc>cou</trunc> I couldn't work like that they must be on edge all the time so <unclear/></u>
<u n="79" who="S0370">mm it's what you get used to innit? those bank dealers that were</u>
<u n="80" who="S0012">oh yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0370">moving</u>
<u n="82" who="S0012">moving</u>
<u n="83" who="S0370">millions and millions around every day it's just a number</u>
<u n="84" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="85" who="S0013">it is yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0012">and they've been they don't have any conscience anyway so they didn't care anyway that's the whole point about being a a an entrepreneur type person all you've got is <unclear>per</unclear> <unclear/> <unclear>in your eyes</unclear></u>
<u n="87" who="S0370">oh yeah mm mm that's what you're doing you're dealing</u>
<u n="88" who="S0012" trans="overlap">never mind you <pause dur="short"/> doesn't matter how you get em you can set up three hundred people to make another few</u>
<u n="89" who="S0370">and I would argue that's one thing that the Eastern Muslims have got right and we've got wrong cos er a Muslims you're not allowed to invest the invest your money in a bank if it's not a risk</u>
<u n="90" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="91" who="S0370">so you can't just invest your money knowing I get four percent return</u>
<u n="92" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="93" who="S0370">you can invest your money in a business</u>
<u n="94" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0370">and if it does well you get a return if it doesn't you don't</u>
<u n="96" who="S0013">like shares then</u>
<u n="97" who="S0370">yeah exactly you're not allowed to make money that's usury in their mind</u>
<u n="98" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0370">making money without any risk is wrong</u>
<u n="100" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="101" who="S0370">and I think it is</u>
<u n="102" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0370">but most of our income in this country is done exactly like that</u>
<u n="104" who="S0012">but if you are a Muslim in this country as well you put you get ten percent of your money to the church</u>
<u n="105" who="S0370">of your income</u>
<u n="106" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0370">no it's of your total wealth</u>
<u n="108" who="S0012">is it your total wealth or</u>
<u n="109" who="S0370">mm mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0013">wow</u>
<u n="111" who="S0012">each year</u>
<u n="112" who="S0370">I thought it went to charity</u>
<u n="113" who="S0013">ten percent of your total wealth</u>
<u n="114" who="S0370">mm</u>
<u n="115" who="S0013">alright we've got we've got a house that doesn't mean to say we could afford to afford to put ten percent of this in</u>
<u n="116" who="S0012">no we couldn't</u>
<u n="117" who="S0370">yes but it's not income it's total wealth</u>
<u n="118" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="119" who="S0013">that's what I mean this is this counts as total wealth though isn't it?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0370">I suppose so I don't know</u>
<u n="121" who="S0012">so we</u>
<u n="122" who="S0013">so how would we afford to put in a percentage</u>
<u n="123" who="S0370">you wouldn't</u>
<u n="124" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="125" who="S0370">mm I'm pretty sure it's not income it's wealth</u>
<u n="126" who="S0012">yeah</u>

<u n="348" who="S0370">yeah they're actually beginning to bring out I'm just amazed how slow they've been to do it erm microwave specific recipes now</u>
<u n="349" who="S0012">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="350" who="S0370">things like crème brûlée and so on and how to make them in a microwave</u>
<u n="351" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="352" who="S0370">they never did microwaves have always been almost always been treated as a sort of a something slightly better than a food warmer</u>
<u n="353" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="354" who="S0370">and nothing more</u>
<u n="355" who="S0013">we use to make out steamed puddings and that in there didn't we?</u>
<u n="356" who="S0012">well yeah the <trunc>br</trunc></u>
<u n="357" who="S0013">two minutes for steam pudding</u>
<u n="358" who="S0370">a a steam pudding is five five minutes isn't it?</u>
<u n="359" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="360" who="S0370">whereas if you steamed it in a ah they have the same</u>
<u n="361" who="S0013">they're about the same cos they go hard very quick if you eat it straight fresh it's lovely but you can't keep it</u>
<u n="362" who="S0370">oh right okay</u>
<u n="363" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="364" who="S0370">erm <trunc>L</trunc>Lakeland have bought out a microwave pressure cooker</u>
<u n="365" who="S0012">really?</u>
<u n="366" who="S0013">that sounds different</u>
<u n="367" who="S0370">it does yeah yeah twenty-five quid it is so it looks like a well it looks like a flat microwave</u>
<u n="368" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="369" who="S0370">but it's made out of very rigid plastic it's still got a pressure valve and everything on it</u>
<u n="370" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="371" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="372" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="373" who="S0012">well that one it's supposed to be an oven a grill</u>
<u n="374" who="S0370">yeah</u>
<u n="375" who="S0012">everything you can imagine it's a combi whatever</u>
<u n="376" who="S0370">yeah same as we've got yeah</u>
<u n="377" who="S0012">and we've all we've done is use the microwave</u>
<u n="378" who="S0013">basically</u>
<u n="379" who="S0012">superb jacket potatoes</u>
<u n="380" who="S0013">yeah but basically it's reheating you know old cooking</u>
<u n="381" who="S0012">yeah making cocoa at night</u>
<u n="382" who="S0370">scrambled egg I make in the microwave</u>
<u n="383" who="S0012">yeah you can do that too</u>
<u n="384" who="S0013">much much better than cooked</u>
<u n="385" who="S0012">and custard it's easy to make</u>
<u n="386" who="S0370">I do custard in the microwave yeah <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> doesn't she still does it in the saucepan but</u>
<u n="387" who="S0013">it takes such a long time standing there in a saucepan</u>
<u n="388" who="S0370">but I'm sure there are improved ways of cooking in the microwave</u>
<u n="389" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="390" who="S0370">trouble is its size you see really if you're going to cook a meal in the microwave you need four of em</u>
<u n="391" who="S0012">yeah there there are new ones out now</u>
<u n="392" who="S0370">like a hob you got to treat it like a hob and an oven</u>
<u n="393" who="S0012">the new ones out have two two different levels</u>
<u n="394" who="S0370">oh yeah</u>
<u n="395" who="S0013">well I've got two different levels</u>
<u n="396" who="S0370">you can put a shelf in</u>
<u n="397" who="S0013">there is a shelf? it's a new larder</u>
<u n="398" who="S0370">but you'd need more than that you need the different because it's so short time you need you need four of them to do it all at the same time don't you?</u>
<u n="399" who="S0013">yes you do yeah</u>
<u n="400" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="401" who="S0013">it's useless</u>
<u n="402" who="S0370">and it's a different style instead of planning on cooking a meal over an hour you plan cooking a meal over eight minutes</u>
<u n="403" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="404" who="S0013">but if you're reheating so you've got stuff leftover you're reheating like five people's <pause dur="short"/> things it's it takes about fifteen minutes more? you might as well put the oven on sometimes</u>
<u n="405" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="406" who="S0370">yeah because you're in and out and in and out</u>
<u n="407" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="408" who="S0013">mm and then you're not all eating at once so you've got to <trunc>re</trunc> got to put the one's you did first back in don't you?</u>
<u n="409" who="S0012">yeah yes <pause dur="short"/> and one and another thing we found when you heat a microwave reheat a dinner on a in a bigger microwave like you make your potatoes and stuff on <pause dur="short"/> it's all steaming hot and lovely but it don't hold the heat</u>
<u n="410" who="S0013">yeah they do go down don't he?</u>
<u n="411" who="S0012" trans="overlap">it seems to get colder quicker</u>
<u n="412" who="S0370">well that's illogical isn't it?</u>
<u n="413" who="S0012">it is it is but that's what it seems</u>
<u n="414" who="S0370">the only explanation of that must be that it's not fully heated right the way through</u>
<u n="415" who="S0012">well it could be</u>
<u n="416" who="S0013">that's normally the case</u>
<u n="417" who="S0370" trans="overlap">microwaves don't heat form the out inside out</u>
<u n="418" who="S0012">no they don't know</u>
<u n="419" who="S0370">in fact</u>
<u n="420" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="421" who="S0370">that's a fallacy</u>
<u n="422" who="S0012">but we'll often go through there with our dinner which is steaming hot out of the microwave got through there start to eat it and think ah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0370">I think it's because it at a certain foods absorb the microwaves more than others</u>
<u n="424" who="S0012">yeah they do yeah</u>
<u n="425" who="S0370">get more excited and hot whereas other bits don't</u>
<u n="426" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="427" who="S0370">the same in the one that you know polystyrene doesn't take heat away from your hands so it feels warm</u>
<u n="428" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="429" who="S0370">that kind of</u>
<u n="430" who="S0013">yeah you've got to</u>
<u n="431" who="S0370">but yeah I I don't think people ever cook effectively in microwaves until there's you can buy a bank of them that's what they apparently in the real big posh</u>
<u n="432" who="S0013">whoops <event desc="sound of dropping something"/></u>
<u n="433" who="UNKMULTI" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="434" who="S0370">the real big posh restaurants all use a whole bank of they've got a banks of microwaves and they sell you know when you have a erm you know a steam pudding with a chocolate filling inside</u>
<u n="435" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="436" who="S0370">well you can't be cooking those as they're ordered</u>
<u n="437" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="438" who="S0370">they're precooked and the only way you can do it and I think it's because the the dense liquid absorbs the heat</u>
<u n="439" who="S0012">yes yeah</u>
<u n="440" who="S0370">is in a microwave</u>
<u n="441" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="442" who="S0370">you have to you have to microwave at the bottom of the microwave cos then you get the warm sponge and the hot inside</u>
<u n="443" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="444" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="445" who="S0370">hot liquid inside</u>
<u n="446" who="S0013">it is great for warming things</u>
<u n="447" who="S0370" trans="overlap">now there's other thing that a a you know a posh chef would not dream of cooking in a microwave</u>
<u n="448" who="S0012">that's right that's right</u>
<u n="449" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="450" who="S0012">I used to do <trunc>de</trunc>deliver up to this club up in <anon type="place"/> and er they used to do dinners and I've been in the kitchens to take the milk in and they had all dinners out cauliflower broccoli potatoes all in little bits they they must have bought bought a boy in ready to cook all laid out in big</u>
<u n="451" who="S0013">that's all they did really</u>
<u n="452" who="S0012">tubs and that's all they did</u>
<u n="453" who="S0370">it wasn't cooked</u>
<u n="454" who="S0013">no</u>
<u n="455" who="S0012">it wasn't cooked they'd bought it all in loads of that cooked</u>

<u n="459" who="S0013">partially cooked yeah</u>
<u n="460" who="S0012">partially cooked and all they had to do was heat it up in the microwave</u>
<u n="461" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="462" who="S0370">mm</u>
<u n="463" who="S0013">just put it on the plates</u>
<u n="464" who="S0012" trans="overlap">and they had boxes and boxes of these all the vegetables you can imagine cos when when people are four people order dinner they order their dinner they all want their dinner at once</u>

<u n="475" who="S0370">well I think washing actually wastes the total value of recycling</u>
<u n="476" who="S0013">it does</u>
<u n="477" who="S0370">the amount of water people do do you know lots of people put their cans to recycle in the dishwasher before they put them in the recycling</u>

<u n="491" who="S0012">but this is</u>
<u n="492" who="S0370">has to have been lost by the water I've wasted</u>
<u n="493" who="S0012">this is where we're different you see we we save every drop of water we can don't we? if we have any leftover see that little gel up there</u>
<u n="494" who="S0370">yeah</u>
