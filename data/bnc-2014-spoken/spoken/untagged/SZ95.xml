<u n="75" who="S0202">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0216">it is better but like <pause dur="short"/> the the head like head office is deciding whether they wanna open the pub on the night <pause dur="short"/> so that means it'll be open till one <pause dur="short"/> like <pause dur="short"/> so then that'll be crap cos like <pause dur="short"/> I can deal with a day shift cos my mam just made like made the dinner a bit later and stuff</u>
