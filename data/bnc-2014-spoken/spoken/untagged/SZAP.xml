<u n="1" who="S0261">there we go okay?</u>
<u n="2" who="S0262">alright</u>
<u n="3" who="S0261">so er now it's on</u>
<u n="4" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="5" who="S0261">we are on <pause dur="long"/> this is</u>
<u n="6" who="S0262">so let's just pretend okay</u>
<u n="7" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="8" who="S0262">the</u>
<u n="9" who="S0261" trans="overlap">so we're starting with three shapes which represent</u>
<u n="10" who="S0262" trans="overlap">the three three core competences of the business</u>
<u n="11" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="12" who="S0262">okay? not in any particularly <trunc>ord</trunc> well yes no it will be in a particular order</u>
<u n="13" who="S0261">right</u>
<u n="14" who="S0262">this represents technology</u>
<u n="15" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="16" who="S0262">social media technologies</u>
<u n="17" who="S0261">right so this is er about communication</u>
<u n="18" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="19" who="S0261">yes?</u>
<u n="20" who="S0262">so it's about using technology to good effect</u>
<u n="21" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="22" who="S0262">off the back of that</u>
<u n="23" who="S0261" trans="overlap">making the most of being able to spread the word</u>
<u n="24" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="25" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="26" who="S0262">exactly erm off the back of that because I've already made a start and there's other people who I can draw in erm to come into the academic world so this represents a an academic world and academic world is important because if you really got the end game being on the erm the er publishing companies erm most of the way I think you actually get to do this sort of work is when you've been hanging around here and getting to know people in the right places</u>
<u n="27" who="S0261">er publishing in academia?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0262"><trunc>ye</trunc> er publishing in in people buying books like your study skills books</u>
<u n="29" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="30" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="31" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah okay yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0262">study skills that's what I'm</u>
<u n="33" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="34" who="S0262">well known for</u>
<u n="35" who="S0261">right</u>
<u n="36" who="S0262">so <pause dur="short"/> this actually funnily enough is erm really what I wanna do er <trunc>pub</trunc> to publishing I I want to do more work in this area of how to argue</u>
<u n="37" who="S0261">right</u>
<u n="38" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="39" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0262">okay?</u>
<u n="41" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="42" who="S0262">there's a lot more that can be done in this area and I known that cos I've been working in this study skills learning skills area for three and a half years</u>
<u n="43" who="S0261">right yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0262" trans="overlap">okay so I know that business quite well</u>
<u n="45" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="46" who="S0262">so this is <anon type="miscPersonalInfo"/></u>
<u n="47" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="48" who="S0262">and this how we get the students to tell us what they want <pause dur="short"/> so we do our market research by getting students involved in telling us what they want</u>
<u n="49" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="50" who="S0262">we get we get that information and we kind of cherry-pick the bits that we think are useful for us and</u>
<u n="51" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="52" who="S0262">in terms of moving into the academic realm and hobnobbing with the right people that means going to conferences and shit</u>
<u n="53" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0262">and then when erm you rub up again with erm academics who know people who are already in with the with the publishing companies erm you make the sort of erm you know business step into you know a fully and what I would call a digital a digitalised you know <trunc>p</trunc> publication you know it's a it's <trunc>i</trunc> it's going to the next realm of what we were looking at in terms of China and and and Vietnam not necessarily on language proficiency though I do think language and arguments do go together</u>
<u n="55" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="56" who="S0262">so I can see that I can teach people language but I can also teach people how to argue</u>
<u n="57" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="58" who="S0262">more effectively</u>
<u n="59" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="60" who="S0262">in academic world</u>
<u n="61" who="S0261">okay</u>
<u n="62" who="S0262">and we could even go to <trunc>Sainsbur</trunc> secondary school with this as well so cos it's poorly done so that's what I think is how it could work</u>
<u n="63" who="S0261">yes okay so <pause dur="short"/> you're interested in delivering a message to the masses about how to learn <pause dur="short"/> or <trunc>lear</trunc> the the context of learning within er university</u>
<u n="64" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="65" who="S0261">er and other institutions or or university university?</u>
<u n="66" who="S0262">we'll keep it to universities for now</u>
<u n="67" who="S0261">so you'd start there</u>
<u n="68" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="69" who="S0261">so it's kind of like how Facebook started</u>
<u n="70" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0261">that started at college basically</u>
<u n="72" who="S0262">mm okay</u>
<u n="73" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and and everybody so that they tested an idea within one crowd and and within moments it had spread to all these other unis that wanted the same system <pause dur="short"/> so and of course there are others who like to be involved and think that they were there first erm so yes testing it within er a university crowd is probably a reasonable context <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> what what is it that you're seeking to try and share the message of and take out of? what do you get out of it?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0262">okay well</u>
<u n="75" who="S0261" trans="overlap">so if you're if you say that</u>
<u n="76" who="S0262" trans="overlap">in social yeah</u>
<u n="77" who="S0261" trans="overlap">you've got people who er you would choose to interview</u>
<u n="78" who="S0262">okay wait so social media <pause dur="short"/> erm typically where what we've been looking at erm is is like say <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> he's got a message <pause dur="short"/> er he responds to people</u>
<u n="79" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="80" who="S0262">he does respond but he's basically the person delivering the message yeah?</u>
<u n="81" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="82" who="S0262">I I don't see any other people around right now what I like about the interview technique is that it puts people normally if you're really good at it it puts people on an equal level of contribution</u>
<u n="83" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0262">and erm what you'd call collaboration knowledge co-construction of knowledge right?</u>
<u n="85" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0262">so yes I do want students to deliver me messages more importantly I want them to come to that site and <trunc>s</trunc> and and basically put in er you know an email request for me to interview them about something that they think passionately about in terms of the higher education you know realm of studying and learning and erm and I ask them questions on it and then I'm getting the message loud and clear that oh shit things aren't really that great <pause dur="short"/> and if anybody else is watching they can have benefit from that too <pause dur="short"/> primarily I'm meant to be benefitting from it because basically I'm the one who's running that work that erm that website</u>
<u n="87" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0262">okay? so I don't know how all the IPR stuff works I have no idea but yes essentially I'm creating a platform where people can come deliver their message to me <pause dur="short"/> and I'm not delivering any messages there is a <trunc>cer</trunc> another side to it though and I think outsourcing could be useful here <pause dur="short"/> is that</u>
<u n="89" who="S0261">can I just be clear about what message are people trying to</u>
<u n="90" who="S0262" trans="overlap">right so in this book in this article</u>
<u n="91" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0262">it talks about and you need to read it but it talks about student engagement and disengagement so I deliver a message at the beginning of my website which explains the mission of the website the mission of the website is to get students to deliver messages or ideas on how to engage at university and to stop disengagement from occurring at university cos at the moment we're experiencing high levels of attrition in the first year <pause dur="short"/> because students are not engaged with what's going on when they're learning they're not given options to actually engage it's a fundamental problem for all Australian universities at the moment</u>
<u n="93" who="S0261">so <pause dur="long"/> really that that sounds like a <pause dur="long"/> er a mothers' meeting <pause dur="short"/> it sounds a <trunc>pl</trunc> a place where people share their problems on that er</u>
<u n="94" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no no it's not cos there's gonna be a dogma yeah? the dogma's gonna say <pause dur="short"/> you're allowed to <trunc>y</trunc> you're allowed to mention the name of your university but that's it you're not allowed to mention any names <pause dur="short"/> okay? you're <trunc>all</trunc></u>
<u n="95" who="S0261" trans="overlap">you mean persons?</u>
<u n="96" who="S0262">yeah you're allowed to talk about the success <pause dur="short"/> of what your university is doing to engage you in your study so this one is geared up for success story it's not bitchy and moany and whining</u>
<u n="97" who="S0261">right okay</u>
<u n="98" who="S0262">yeah?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0261">yeah and that okay and that's fine <pause dur="short"/> and so in that context you can get others involved who aren't students who help teach the students about the the bigger picture?</u>
<u n="100" who="S0262">well also success breeds success so if you see that erm Perth a Western Australia university is doing a student erm film festival and then the other students see that over on the other side er east side of of the coast and go well why don't we do that?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="102" who="S0262">we should go and ask the people who were meant to be engaging us to allow us to do shit like this and give us money so that we can run our own student film festival</u>
<u n="103" who="S0261">mm uh-mm mm <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="long"/> and so if you look at where you start from yeah there you've gotta create some kind of database of information to start with <pause dur="short"/> and that <pause dur="long"/> you need to find a mechanism to spread your message before you start</u>
<u n="104" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="105" who="S0261">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so there are certain lead elements before you actually go live with the stuff that you're doing</u>
<u n="106" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="107" who="S0261">and have you got a picture in your mind of when you would like to make that happen?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah I want this to happen in I want it to go live in <pause dur="long"/> yeah I'm flexible by about a week but essentially erm <pause dur="short"/> I <pause dur="short"/> yeah no oh yeah okay no I <trunc>n</trunc> I need it to go live I need it I need it to be launched in that week <pause dur="short"/> that</u>
<u n="109" who="S0261" trans="overlap">well frankly you're dreaming <pause dur="short"/> you're talking about the six-week period that we have available <pause dur="short"/> before we go to August <pause dur="short"/> yeah? what is it that you want to launch rather</u>
<u n="110" who="S0262">erm</u>
<u n="111" who="S0261" trans="overlap">I'm not saying I want you</u>
<u n="112" who="S0262" trans="overlap">some videos a few videos <pause dur="short"/> a few interview videos of students' work</u>
<u n="113" who="S0261">right so <pause dur="short"/> strategically <pause dur="short"/> don't you wanna hit the ground like massively running?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0262">what size are you thinking of?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0261">well <pause dur="short"/> you need time to to allow the message to get out there to build an audience right?</u>
<u n="116" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0261">and what you want is an audience to turn up on day one</u>
<u n="118" who="S0262">I know that's why it's</u>
<u n="119" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0262">semester one <pause dur="short"/> the week one semester</u>
<u n="121" who="S0261">that's this year</u>
<u n="122" who="S0262">yeah week one semester</u>
<u n="123" who="S0261">well if you consider the amount of work that actually needs to be done in the context of what else you've got to to do <pause dur="short"/> yeah?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0262">well yeah but let's just say that we can get some hands on you know resources of people backing us to get that bit going</u>
<u n="125" who="S0261">erm <pause dur="short"/> I'm not afraid of hard work <trunc>bu</trunc></u>
<u n="126" who="S0262" trans="overlap">I thought we were gonna outsource some of this</u>
<u n="127" who="S0261">yeah just hear me out right?</u>
<u n="128" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm okay</u>
<u n="129" who="S0261">going away in June</u>
<u n="130" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah? come back midst June</u>
<u n="132" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="133" who="S0261">you're talking about the six five to six week period er it's a six week period to get to there</u>
<u n="134" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0261">right? so in that six weeks you've still got to deliver certain things</u>
<u n="136" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="137" who="S0261">and <pause dur="short"/> what we talked about was having say ten interviews available</u>
<u n="138" who="S0262">no</u>
<u n="139" who="S0261" trans="overlap">right?</u>
<u n="140" who="S0262">I didn't say ten er you said ten I never said ten</u>
<u n="141" who="S0261">er okay so when you start erm what kind of frequency do you want to publish information on <pause dur="short"/> to keep up the momentum?</u>
<u n="142" who="S0262">I dunno well you tell me what do you think's beneficial?</u>
<u n="143" who="S0261">well <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> you could start with weekly <pause dur="short"/> you know so you're doing one per week</u>
<u n="144" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="145" who="S0261">and erm <pause dur="short"/> it it's not usual to do a higher frequency than that people who do a higher frequency than that are working particularly hard right?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0261">or they have that particular focus so if you start somewhere start with one per week</u>
<u n="148" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="149" who="S0261">and er and you need to maintain a connection with your audience right?</u>
<u n="150" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0261">so you you get your your pre-message out there you create a launch platform</u>
<u n="152" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0261">you have a a a landing page for a website</u>
<u n="154" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="155" who="S0261">which people you get people to sign up to that to start with</u>
<u n="156" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="157" who="S0261">before you get to the video stage</u>
<u n="158" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="159" who="S0261">right? and you might try and erm promote that there's there's a product that they might be interested in yeah? so they get access to that by signing up <pause dur="short"/> create a mini product which gives a benefit to people right for free yeah? they sign up they get the product they they see what's going on and they get an interest and then you can put out a couple of YouTube videos which er which tag in at your website yeah? so then you've got a visual message out there that you can steer people to straight up without going to your website but it takes it back through a loop to your website so the curious go and have a look at that and sign up</u>
<u n="160" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="161" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah? erm and you can and you and you wanna try and create some kind of message that goes through your Facebook er and Twitter et cetera so the it can get shared</u>
<u n="162" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0261" trans="overlap">amongst the social stuff</u>
<u n="164" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0261">so you have to get all those things in place upfront and then you want erm a a a series of videos that you've got pre-prepared that you can launch to take the pressure off having to create those at those times</u>
<u n="166" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="167" who="S0261">so you launch one you're going to be dealing with trying to capture that market and capture the people</u>
<u n="168" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="169" who="S0261">and that's where your time's gonna be spent rather than making videos</u>
<u n="170" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="171" who="S0261">so if you've got a few made in advance you've bought yourself time to get used to that process</u>
<u n="172" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0261">and then <trunc>cre</trunc> and then you start creating them ongoing basis</u>
<u n="174" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="175" who="S0261">so you might say oh well I've got a couple of weeks left I need to start creating some more videos so then I've got a buffer</u>
<u n="176" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="177" who="S0261">of more right? erm and you'll find that information will come in that you'll want to try and adapt with</u>
<u n="178" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="179" who="S0261">to try and help streamline a few things and what have you all sorts of systems you need to make sure are set up</u>
<u n="180" who="S0262">yeah you say you</u>
<u n="181" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and so on</u>
<u n="182" who="S0262">meaning I er is that meaning like you?</u>
<u n="183" who="S0261">well that's us yeah?</u>
<u n="184" who="S0262">oh oh okay</u>
<u n="185" who="S0261">that's us</u>
<u n="186" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="187" who="S0261">erm er and and sure outsourcing and getting people onboard erm some of the stuff I have an awareness of but I've never done</u>
<u n="188" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="189" who="S0261">so I need in that June period I would be looking to be using something to to to learn and create and I'd prefer to know how to do that first before I do it in real for this</u>
<u n="190" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="191" who="S0261">right? so erm part of it is what I I would have put that kind of platform together with <anon type="miscPersonalInfo"/></u>
<u n="192" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="193" who="S0261">but they weren't receptive to that but I have a quite a big big picture of</u>
<u n="194" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="195" who="S0261">it's quite a large platform of</u>
<u n="196" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="197" who="S0261">how you bash it out yeah?</u>
<u n="198" who="S0262" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="199" who="S0261">and and you're <trunc>tryi</trunc> the real thing is about trying to create a strong launch</u>
<u n="200" who="S0262">mm</u>

<u n="283" who="S0261">so you can say in that six months that allows you to build one side of it and the other</u>

<u n="317" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="318" who="S0261"><trunc>a</trunc> they do typically what's called affiliate marketing</u>
<u n="319" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="320" who="S0261">so like what that other guy was doing he was hanging different products off his site</u>
<u n="321" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="322" who="S0261">but it's such that if somebody clicks through your site to go and purchase that product he would have got a commission from the software company</u>
<u n="323" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="324" who="S0261">so it's a kickback yeah for sending people in in in their direction</u>
<u n="325" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="326" who="S0261">so what you would do</u>
<u n="327" who="S0262"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="328" who="S0261">is you would identify key parts that er <pause dur="short"/> erm key erm <pause dur="short"/> key companies or key outfits that you would want to connect to</u>
<u n="329" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="330" who="S0261">and what you're trying to do is you're getting exposure because you are actually <trunc>usi</trunc> you wanna use their email list their contacts you wanna draw them in as well</u>

<u n="338" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="339" who="S0262" trans="overlap">how to do it cos I think he does that day in day out so it would be good to touch base with him and</u>
<u n="340" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah for sure</u>
<u n="341" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and I think getting a a sound erm independent outlook</u>
<u n="343" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="344" who="S0261">is good</u>
<u n="345" who="S0262">get some measurements in thrown in there cos that's what companies want to see</u>
<u n="346" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0262" trans="overlap">how do you measure this?</u>

<u n="352" who="S0261" trans="overlap">and then</u>
<u n="353" who="S0262" trans="overlap">more as a sort of you know cursory kind of advisor</u>
<u n="354" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm and we want to be able to capture some metrics as we go</u>
<u n="355" who="S0262">yeah absolutely</u>
<u n="356" who="S0261">yeah?</u>
<u n="357" who="S0262">so I have got a couple of ideas of how to do that erm <anon type="miscPersonalInfo"/> of cool port is er makes you think of you know water but <trunc>simi</trunc> similarly erm if you take the idea of port being an airport right?</u>
<u n="358" who="S0261">or a portal</u>
<u n="359" who="S0262">a portal yeah I'm thinking port meaning something like you know <pause dur="short"/> port it's a place where you arrive it's a place where you kind of get off at a destination that's why we got the idea airport <pause dur="short"/> harbour port you know?</u>
<u n="360" who="S0261">you're saying well you pitch this to an international student saying you're arriving from outside of this place</u>
<u n="361" who="S0262" trans="overlap">so one of my dogma questions in the interview is <pause dur="short"/> so Sarah tell me what's so cool about studying in where you are?</u>
<u n="362" who="S0261">mm <pause dur="short"/> exactly</u>
<u n="363" who="S0262">and she gets hey Montreal is like blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah</u>
<u n="364" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="365" who="S0262">and oh Sydney's fantastic because blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah</u>
<u n="366" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm and so people</u>
<u n="367" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and if you go to</u>
<u n="368" who="S0261" trans="overlap">get this international feel for it</u>
<u n="369" who="S0262">so <vocal desc="whistle"/> planes</u>
<u n="370" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="371" who="S0262">that's what kids get on these days buy er plane tickets and they go somewhere</u>
<u n="372" who="S0261">mm mm yeah</u>
<u n="373" who="S0262">so I'm thinking airline carrier</u>
<u n="374" who="S0261">oh as an affiliate?</u>
<u n="375" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="376" who="S0261">well could be <pause dur="long"/> that's one one option yeah <pause dur="short"/> of the myriad sector you could choose</u>
<u n="377" who="S0262">well I mean it would only happen if it was a majorly successful site</u>
<u n="378" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="379" who="S0262">it's may as well aim big there</u>
<u n="380" who="S0261">well you wanna be aiming high</u>
<u n="381" who="S0262">I'm aiming very high</u>
<u n="382" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="383" who="S0262">I'm thinking New <trunc>Zeal</trunc> Air New Zealand or Qantas <pause dur="short"/> or someone else air er if we go Asia Pacific</u>
<u n="384" who="S0261">Virgin</u>
<u n="385" who="S0262">who? Virgin yeah alright</u>
<u n="386" who="S0261">er if wanna kind of think flamboyant and think entrepreneurial and think the kind of people who like the spirit of entrepreneurs Virgin's a good outfit to run</u>
<u n="387" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="388" who="S0261">if you get somebody like Branson saying hello</u>
<u n="389" who="S0262">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="390" who="S0261">you just have to get him to say hello</u>
<u n="391" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="392" who="S0261">because he would like the idea that you're sending business his way er <trunc>thr</trunc> through some educational means <pause dur="short"/> or maybe he wouldn't he hates the education</u>
<u n="393" who="S0262">does he?</u>
<u n="394" who="S0261">yeah he doesn't believe in the <trunc>con</trunc> well it's not that he hates the education he doesn't believe in the <trunc>contex</trunc> the concept of of business schools et cetera</u>
<u n="395" who="S0262">but this is about students telling us</u>
<u n="396" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="397" who="S0262">what they want he likes that he likes having</u>
<u n="398" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="399" who="S0262" trans="overlap">customers telling you</u>
<u n="400" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah yeah yeah</u>

<u n="403" who="S0262" trans="overlap">what they want</u>
<u n="404" who="S0261">yeah no I'm I'm let's not suppose that one but yeah that in the rounds that sounds quite strategically interesting <pause dur="short"/> erm so you're saying <pause dur="short"/> er a small launch that is focussed on a bunch of people so like we talked about having a list of a bunch of people that have a strong network contact so then you can start building</u>
<u n="405" who="S0262">I think it should be thematic as well</u>
<u n="406" who="S0261" trans="overlap">through their</u>
<u n="407" who="S0262">I I actually do think month in month out you should we should be picking themes <pause dur="short"/> so one theme could be you know tell us about something recent that you've done that you've engaged with outside of your curriculum you know something like that but much catchier</u>
<u n="408" who="S0261">yeah mm</u>
<u n="409" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and then another theme might be you know tell us about something cool that your lecturer did the other day you know or tell us about some educational technology that you didn't know about and how you you know so the themes are always about engagement but I know <trunc>h</trunc> I know so much about engagement that I can pick off probably twelve themes that I could cover throughout the year</u>
<u n="410" who="S0261">yeah okay erm <pause dur="short"/> I I think starting with themes seems reasonable <pause dur="short"/> and then as you kind of get through it you you probably wanna mix things up so it's it's less kind of chunk chunk chunk</u>
<u n="411" who="S0262" trans="overlap">I want a box where people can write in to me and suggest themes like so frank so people write in say you know</u>
<u n="412" who="S0261">well that's what you use your test crowd for upfront</u>
<u n="413" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="414" who="S0261">you'll ask them their opinions you'll get their feeling you see what they like and try them on products and see <trunc>wh</trunc> how they react to it get their feedback all of that kind of stuff</u>
<u n="415" who="S0262">don't want too much cos students have got a completely minimal attention span</u>
<u n="416" who="S0261">yeah well you're probably trying to draw in those who will react like that say if it's strength on</u>
<u n="417" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah I don't want it too hard <unclear>basket</unclear> straight away though we need to make it as fucking easy to participate as possible and I know that basically</u>
<u n="418" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah well that that's what you're trying to to test</u>
<u n="419" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="420" who="S0261">you're trying to test whether your your ideas are are <trunc>a</trunc> aligned with what they think</u>

<u n="422" who="S0261">as as much as you think you know you will find surprises</u>
<u n="423" who="S0262">well I know a <trunc>sh</trunc> short amount of time to fill out erm an an email thing where they give me my their email address is good</u>
<u n="424" who="S0261">yeah and and I mean just what I you know I obviously said that to <anon type="miscPersonalInfo"/> I said well engage some of your erm customers to start with before you launch this stuff get the feeling of what they like and dislike and then build that into the system before you</u>
<u n="425" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="426" who="S0261">before you do the major launch and that's what I'm saying with the six month period you look to try and optimise that so when you do go bang you go bang with a big bang</u>
<u n="427" who="S0262">yeah alright</u>
<u n="428" who="S0261">and <trunc>a</trunc> amongst all of that time you've got to test that you've damn well</u>

<u n="511" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="512" who="S0261">to that</u>
<u n="513" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="514" who="S0261">yeah? so then you've got a story to tell we had an interview with X Y Z</u>
<u n="515" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="516" who="S0261">these were the points</u>
<u n="517" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="518" who="S0261">and then this is the feedback or that this is some reflection from guest lecturer blah-blah-blah-blah-blah</u>
<u n="519" who="S0262" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="520" who="S0261">that that that</u>
<u n="521" who="S0262" trans="overlap">I mean don't tell them too much cos you really do want to</u>
<u n="522" who="S0261" trans="overlap">the Sage from the the Sage</u>
<u n="523" who="S0262">yeah you just give them a log line of about three words and then they've got to go and listen to the podcast on the website</u>
<u n="524" who="S0261">yeah yeah yeah yeah but what it however it's formatted</u>
<u n="525" who="S0262">mm</u>
<u n="526" who="S0261">and how whatever it looks like but you can I can get the gist</u>
<u n="527" who="S0262">okay</u>
<u n="528" who="S0261">that's quite cool</u>
<u n="529" who="S0262">so the thing</u>
<u n="530" who="S0261" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="531" who="S0262">about it is then is that</u>
<u n="532" who="S0261">what's in it for the lecturer?</u>
<u n="533" who="S0262">oh well we'll come to that in a minute erm Sage <pause dur="short"/> sage has got to have a personality because he hasn't got a face <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="534" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="535" who="S0262">so Sage has to have a narrative working around him</u>
<u n="536" who="S0261">yes</u>
<u n="537" who="S0262" trans="overlap">okay otherwise he's just gonna be fucking boring</u>
<u n="538" who="S0261">well you can make it sound like a podcast</u>
<u n="539" who="S0262">yeah well it will be a podcast but what I'm trying to say is I'm creating a persona for Sage here</u>
<u n="540" who="S0261">yes yeah that's right</u>
<u n="541" who="S0262" trans="overlap">cos he hasn't got a face he's like an avatar in a way</u>
<u n="542" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="543" who="S0262">but not cos I don't hate avatars okay</u>
<u n="544" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="545" who="S0262">so he won't have a cartoon face he will not have a face he will just have a voice okay? so that's something that students are gonna feel a bit wary about but what are we gonna tell them about Sage? hang on let me have a go cos I'm I haven't had a chance</u>
<u n="546" who="S0261" trans="overlap">I haven't said anything</u>
<u n="547" who="S0262">well you were about to Sage is gonna have two things going for him okay? to appeal to the male student audience he's gonna love test-driving cars <pause dur="short"/> and the other one <pause dur="short"/> for the female audience who are gonna have a really kind of like you know over sort of imagination about who this fella is yeah there's gonna be a question about I haven't really kind of got it right yet but it's something like along the lines erm you know who do you think Sage most resembles in your role in a role er not a role model but erm you know it'll be better than that but it's about basically you've got to put up photographs of who you think Sage might be okay? so we're gonna have things called wiki surveys and then you always click between two choices and you're getting this interaction going on where students come in they'll listen to the interview and then they get to be interactive and then get to click which car they want test-driven next time or which car they think would most be coolest to test drive okay? so when Sage starts his little piece about the reflection piece he's always starts with it's formatted yeah? so I was driving along the other day in my or in a you know test-driving whatever car yeah? blah-blah-blah-blah-blah and I was thinking about Sarah's interview with you <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> or whatever and this is my response so it always starts with driving along in a car <pause dur="short"/> or a motorbike</u>
<u n="548" who="S0261">yeah okay cool</u>
<u n="549" who="S0262">yeah?</u>
<u n="550" who="S0261">yeah yeah alright</u>
<u n="551" who="S0262">so the reason why I want that to happen is because I want students to engage with the personalities that I've presented to them</u>
<u n="552" who="S0261">well Sage could be Richard Hammond</u>
<u n="553" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="554" who="S0261">cos he loves science and education</u>
<u n="555" who="S0262">Sage could be anyone it's just a voice but Sage actually has to be quite clever</u>
<u n="556" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="557" who="S0262">he can't be somebody who's a bit of a nonce <pause dur="short"/> cos he's got to be able to articulate between what the students are telling him and what he fucking knows about how universities actually work</u>
<u n="558" who="S0261">yeah okay mm</u>
<u n="559" who="S0262">so he's got to be an inside job</u>
<u n="560" who="S0261">yeah</u>
<u n="561" who="S0262">but he can't be too inside on the outside</u>
<u n="562" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="563" who="S0262">cos people start getting a bit wary about it</u>
<u n="564" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="565" who="S0262">even though I clearly work from <anon type="place"/> university</u>
<u n="566" who="S0261">people don't need to know that</u>
<u n="567" who="S0262">ah well this is then this is gonna be the interesting thing isn't it? credibility <pause dur="short"/> anyone say they're a learning advisor but credibility is about you're a learning advisor at which university</u>
<u n="568" who="S0261">at a university</u>
<u n="569" who="S0262">no but think about it you your English fella <anon type="place"/> university he could spread that all around</u>
<u n="570" who="S0261">mm mm mm</u>
<u n="571" who="S0262">well what did he get out of that? well what did they get out of that? so that somebody wants to go to <anon type="place"/> university because they've seen his website</u>
<u n="572" who="S0261">maybe <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's interesting <pause dur="long"/> so <pause dur="short"/> well it sounds like there's quite a lot to do before this end of July</u>
<u n="573" who="S0262">and that's just the beginning</u>
<u n="574" who="S0261">yeah I know</u>
<u n="575" who="S0262">mm</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="576" who="S0261">so</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="577" who="S0262">does that frighten you?</u>
<u n="578" who="S0261">oh I <trunc>don</trunc> I don't know that it frightens me I'm just trying to think realistically that's all</u>
<u n="579" who="S0262">well we <trunc>don</trunc> this is an ideal version you know</u>
<u n="580" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah I know I know I know I know I know know know <trunc>th</trunc> and and there's no reason why it <trunc>ha</trunc> <trunc>wh</trunc>what is the <trunc>wh</trunc> rather what is the reason why it has to be before er that end of July? that's the start of a new semester is it?</u>
<u n="581" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="582" who="S0261">okay</u>
<u n="583" who="S0262">it also means I maximise my erm time at <anon type="place"/> university</u>
<pause dur="long"/>
<u n="584" who="S0261">yes erm <pause dur="short"/> I I kind of think before you get to that semester you <trunc>y</trunc>you wanna have a few things in place that are already kind of there</u>
<u n="585" who="S0262">like?</u>
<u n="586" who="S0261">well it's like when you're trying to say to somebody you want to steer them to a certain place that they want to see that others have already been there</u>
<u n="587" who="S0262">that's how no I've got really good</u>
<u n="588" who="S0261" trans="overlap">that kind of thing</u>
<u n="589" who="S0262">student contacts <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="590" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="591" who="S0262">trust me</u>
<u n="592" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="593" who="S0262">we've got people who I know would turn up tomorrow and do an interview with me and they'll be fascinating</u>
<u n="594" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah yeah I'm not I'm not worried about that</u>
<u n="595" who="S0262">well that's the content that's the bit I do</u>
<u n="596" who="S0261"><trunc>ye</trunc>yeah what I'm saying though is you get to semester one and you want to be trying to launch something</u>
<u n="597" who="S0262">mini launch</u>
<u n="598" who="S0261">mini</u>
<u n="599" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="600" who="S0261">launch yeah and so this mean you you you're actually trying to constrain anything or are you</u>
<u n="601" who="S0262" trans="overlap">no</u>
<u n="602" who="S0261">no? you're just doing a mini launch and see where it goes?</u>
<u n="603" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="604" who="S0261" trans="overlap">right so you take that where where where does it go and before you launch you wanna have already engagement with things like your social sites yeah?</u>
<u n="605" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="606" who="S0261">on a small level but so at least at least that it looks like it's being used</u>
<u n="607" who="S0262">of course</u>
<u n="608" who="S0261" trans="overlap">it's not brand new</u>
<u n="609" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="610" who="S0261">yeah? so erm</u>
<u n="611" who="S0262">so we need er seeders</u>
<u n="612" who="S0261">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="613" who="S0262" trans="overlap">and you need outsourcers</u>
<u n="614" who="S0261">mm mm</u>
<u n="615" who="S0262" trans="overlap">that's where you come in</u>
<u n="616" who="S0261">yeah <trunc>ye</trunc> yeah that's right <pause dur="short"/> but I I just need to get a context of of er how how much work you expect that you'll be doing and how much you think I'll be doing</u>
<u n="617" who="S0262" trans="overlap">I'll I'll do everything I can in the hours that I've got to make this happen</u>
<u n="618" who="S0261">right okay</u>
<u n="619" who="S0262">and I will really really rely on fucking massive favours from people to get it to happen for that for that launch</u>
<u n="620" who="S0261">mm</u>
<u n="621" who="S0262">and we will be away in the UK for the launch so that will be very advantageous</u>
<u n="622" who="S0261"><trunc>ye</trunc> <trunc>ye</trunc> in which context that that you you're er already putting in place a system which is which is others will be dealing with it</u>
<u n="623" who="S0262">no you and I will be dealing it you you're testing this rebel location right? that's what I thought we were doing</u>
<u n="624" who="S0261">yeah yeah no no no that's fine so you wanna test it from afar</u>

<u n="651" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="652" who="S0261">yeah we made a big list so I think it's kind of a case of having to crack on but do a bit of each every day</u>
<u n="653" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="683" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="685" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="686" who="S0261">and really it comes down to you look at it and you go well I haven't got time to do this so I I have to outsource it</u>
<u n="687" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="688" who="S0261">yeah and it's better probably to start with and you say well we'd if we set a budget of X that that money is some of it is set aside for getting others to get certain things done for us</u>
<u n="689" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="690" who="S0261">and in some context I would prefer to use some of the <anon type="miscPersonalInfo"/> people that I know can do it <pause dur="short"/> but if there's a price</u>
<u n="691" who="S0262" trans="overlap">it's up to you</u>
<u n="692" who="S0261">then</u>
<u n="693" who="S0262" trans="overlap">if if that's it's</u>
<u n="694" who="S0261" trans="overlap">I'd go somewhere else and try the outsourcing thing</u>

<u n="696" who="S0261" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="697" who="S0262">for to decide</u>

<u n="699" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="700" who="S0261">facilitate that to make that easy</u>
<u n="701" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="702" who="S0261">and probably it's easier to do it that way and get good product</u>
<u n="703" who="S0262">yeah</u>
<u n="704" who="S0261">straight up</u>
<u n="705" who="S0262">okay so who wants to be in control of that money budget thing?</u>
<u n="706" who="S0261">well I think er just need to schedule a a bunch of things and say well which bits am I gonna do and which bits are we gonna outsource? and then look at relatively how much of my cost</u>
<u n="707" who="S0262">who wants to be control of costing?</u>
<u n="708" who="S0261">I'm happy to cost everything</u>

<u n="879" who="S0262">yeah</u>

<u n="891" who="S0262">is a lot of the time the institutions yeah don't fucking know how to teach so what they do is they buy the licence to the textbook so they actually put that into the syllabus of their unit</u>
<u n="892" who="S0261">yeah okay because that tells the appropriate story</u>
<u n="893" who="S0262">and they get the student to buy a subscription so they get to practise it <pause dur="long"/></u>
