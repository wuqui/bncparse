<u n="246" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="247" who="S0421" trans="overlap">thick glass <pause dur="long"/> cos there's not really been any some people said they've liked dropped it and stuff and it's not broken</u>
<u n="248" who="S0423">oh</u>
<u n="249" who="S0421">cos one of them I was looking at Amazon cos it <trunc>ha</trunc> it had quite a nice design erm but some people were saying oh like you could get one with like a fault in the design and the bottom breaks off</u>
<u n="250" who="S0423">mm</u>

<u n="252" who="S0423">as well I'm thinking though I you know I like it fairly lightweight and I don't want one</u>
<u n="253" who="S0421" trans="overlap">no you're not gonna get a glass one lightweight</u>
<u n="254" who="S0423" trans="overlap">I'd like to see if if it's durable it's not gonna be lightweight if it's lightweight it's gonna be very fragile isn't it?</u>
<u n="255" who="S0421" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0423">for the lightweight it seems to</u>
<u n="257" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="258" who="S0423" trans="overlap">it would be thin glass</u>
<u n="259" who="S0421">like so if you look for lightweight you wanna look at plastic or</u>
<u n="260" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="261" who="S0421" trans="overlap">aluminium if you even if you look at stainless steel stainless steel's heavy</u>

<u n="268" who="S0421" trans="overlap">heavy <pause dur="short"/> but yeah stainless steel is the next best if you don't wanna get a glass one</u>
<u n="269" who="S0423">mm</u>
<u n="270" who="S0421">but like I said you've got to look erm on the inside to check it's the inside part the interior that's one hundred percent stainless steel</u>

<u n="346" who="S0421">yeah</u>
<u n="347" who="S0423">rather than using them every day well practically <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="348" who="S0421">cos I thought I can't be bothered going and trying on different ones that are on in the sale because erm <pause dur="short"/> I might not like them and I have to find the ones I like and I know I like these so</u>
<u n="349" who="S0423">yeah and if they're comfortable then you know you're not gonna have problems with them are you?</u>
