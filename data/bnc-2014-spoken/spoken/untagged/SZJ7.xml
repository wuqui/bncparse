<u n="491" who="S0013" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="492" who="S0012">and we made that at school</u>
<u n="493" who="S0013">yeah <unclear/></u>
<u n="494" who="S0012">so what did we do when we were kids? we went up the chemist and you could buy the stuff</u>
<u n="495" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="496" who="S0012">you could buy the saltpetre you could buy the sulphur and you could buy the carbon or you could make the carbon but you could get it all from the chemist</u>
<u n="497" who="S0013" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="498" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and we used to make it and <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> and me and a few others we made a rifle <vocal desc="laugh"/> hammered over the end of a copper copper pipe about that long <pause dur="short"/> stuffed all the gunpowder down then put a bit of wadding down and then a ball bearing that fitted right through and then we laid it on a fire and all stood behind this tree and waited for it and we had that we had aimed it at this little sapling that was about six inches in diameter and er we aimed at that and that blew a hole straight through the sapling</u>
<u n="499" who="S0152" trans="overlap">straight through <unclear>it</unclear> <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>wow</unclear></u>
<u n="500" who="S0013"><unclear>wow</unclear></u>
<u n="501" who="S0152">we used to make we used to make</u>
<u n="502" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="503" who="S0152">fireworks in the classroom the chemistry teacher did</u>
<u n="504" who="S0012">yeah?</u>
<u n="505" who="S0152">and let them go across</u>
<u n="506" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="507" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="508" who="S0012">iron filings was er</u>
<u n="509" who="S0152" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="510" who="S0012">was er <trunc>o</trunc>one thing I mean you you'd</u>
<u n="511" who="S0152"><unclear/></u>
<u n="512" who="S0012">sprinkle iron filings over your Bunsen burner and wahey</u>
<u n="513" who="S0152" trans="overlap">sparks and everything didn't it?</u>
<u n="514" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah that was brilliant weren't it?</u>
<u n="515" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="516" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="517" who="S0012">can't do that anymore</u>
<u n="518" who="S0152">no we we had things like sodium I think sodium chlorate and when we had this new technician come in <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <pause dur="short"/> one of the one of the members of staff was messing with this <trunc>s</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> sodium <trunc>cal</trunc>calcium chlorate I think it was</u>
<u n="519" who="S0012">cor</u>
<u n="520" who="S0152">or sodium chlorate calcium chlorate and he goes what are you doing? and he goes I'm just doing this he went do you realise the army won't use that cos it's so unstable?</u>
<u n="521" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh crikey</u>
<u n="522" who="S0152">cos it's like a detonator <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="523" who="S0012">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="524" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="525" who="S0152">and it was a substance which was so unstable</u>
<u n="526" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="527" who="S0152">and what he was doing with it he was like oh okay</u>
<u n="528" who="S0012">well they er we used to have sheets of magnesium</u>
<u n="529" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="530" who="S0012">and set <trunc>l</trunc> that alight</u>
<u n="531" who="S0152" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="532" who="S0012">that used to burn and burn and burn didn't it? wow</u>
<u n="533" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="534" who="S0012">that was brilliant</u>
<u n="535" who="S0152" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="536" who="S0012">that was</u>
<u n="537" who="S0152">yeah you could just burn it in you know you used to get a <trunc>s</trunc> you used to see how much oxygen came off it or how much oxide you got cos you got a piece you weigh it then you light it they go off then you weigh the thing</u>
<u n="538" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="539" who="S0152">lots of different things like that but no <unclear>you <trunc>coul</trunc> you could go</unclear> blind it's too light now or</u>
<u n="540" who="S0012">we used to put it in er well our teacher used to put it in a treacle tin and hammer the treacle tin down and of course it <trunc>t</trunc> burn up from the bottom and that used to set alight the heat and boom that used to</u>
<u n="541" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="542" who="S0012">blow the treacle the thing off</u>
<u n="543" who="S0152">yeah Coffee-Mate's a good one</u>
<u n="544" who="S0012">yeah? does it?</u>
<u n="545" who="S0152">Coffee-Mate is absolutely brilliant Coffee-Mate</u>
<u n="546" who="S0012">oh yeah cos that'll burn like</u>
<u n="547" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="548" who="S0012">that'll burn like mad don't it?</u>
<u n="549" who="S0152">yeah if you <trunc>g</trunc>if you get a tin a hollow tin and you got a lid so you got a got a lid on it</u>
<u n="550" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="551" who="S0152">put a candle in it</u>
<u n="552" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="553" who="S0152">right? and you've got a means to puff air in it like that</u>
<u n="554" who="S0012">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="555" who="S0152">so you put your Coffee-Mate in you light the <trunc>c</trunc> well you light the candle you <trunc>p</trunc> your Coffee-Mate's all in the bottom you push air in to pump it so the air makes the Coffee-Mate live inside the can</u>
<u n="556" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0152">that catches fire and blows the lid off the top</u>
<u n="558" who="S0012"><unclear>wow</unclear></u>
<u n="559" who="S0152">cos that's how a combustion engine works</u>
<u n="560" who="S0013">oh right</u>
<u n="561" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="562" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="563" who="S0012">I tell you that the experiment they done on the television</u>
<u n="564" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="565" who="S0012">just just the other day with er custard was it? not custard erm</u>
<u n="566" who="S0013">cornflour?</u>
<u n="567" who="S0152">cornflour?</u>
<u n="568" who="S0012">cornflour</u>
<u n="569" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="570" who="S0012">did it with cornflour they had a <pause dur="short"/> bunsen burner and an air gun you know just a just a</u>
<u n="571" who="S0152" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="572" who="S0012">pressure air gun and they blew the cornflour over the Bunsen burner and that went poof</u>
<u n="573" who="S0152">yeah same type of thing yeah</u>
<u n="574" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="575" who="S0152">cos that's what Coffee-Mate is in some respects isn't it?</u>
<u n="576" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="577" who="S0012">well it is ain't it? yeah</u>
<u n="578" who="S0013" trans="overlap"><unclear>yeah oh right</unclear></u>
<u n="579" who="S0152">a type of dry flour cornflour <unclear/></u>
<u n="580" who="S0012" trans="overlap">cornflour and and dried milk and stuff like that yeah</u>
<u n="581" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="582" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="583" who="S0152">with a with a bit of sugar in to give it a bit of flavouring</u>
<u n="584" who="S0012">but er I mean dust in itself is pretty dangerous</u>
<u n="585" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="586" who="S0012">because I remember in silos it was a few years ago when they used to pump the er barley and and what have you that used to create dust and they used to have dust explosions</u>
<u n="587" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="588" who="S0012">in the silos <pause dur="short"/> blew them up</u>
<u n="589" who="S0152">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="590" who="S0012">so when er I expect they have something different now to do it <unclear/></u>
<u n="591" who="S0152"><unclear>well</unclear> they have some form of earthing device</u>
<u n="592" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="593" who="S0152">so you don't get a spark or something but no it's some of the things you did <pause dur="short"/> we used to make lead</u>
<u n="594" who="S0012">make lead?</u>
<u n="595" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="596" who="S0012">did you? yeah</u>
<u n="597" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="598" who="S0152">used to have you used to have lead oxide</u>
<u n="599" who="S0012">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="600" who="S0152">and there was different <trunc>co</trunc> there was different colours there was red and there was yellow</u>
<u n="601" who="S0012">we used to do it with copper</u>
<u n="602" who="S0152">and you get a carbon block <pause dur="short"/> right? you get a carbon block you would put the lead oxide in the carbon block</u>
<u n="603" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="604" who="S0152">you'd get a blow torch Bunsen burner and you'd blow so you're adding heat to the thing</u>
<u n="605" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="606" who="S0152">and you'd get little lumps of lead</u>
<u n="607" who="S0012">cor right yeah</u>
<u n="608" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="609" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="610" who="S0012">ran out yeah well</u>
<u n="611" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="612" who="S0012">and that they used to have that er blue <pause dur="short"/> that was called copper oxide weren't it? that blue stuff</u>
<u n="613" who="S0152">copper sulphate</u>
<u n="614" who="S0012">copper sulphate that's right and er you could you could make</u>
<u n="615" who="S0152">crystals out of it</u>
<u n="616" who="S0012">crystals out of that yeah</u>
<u n="617" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="618" who="S0152"><unclear>and</unclear> we used to go worming</u>
<u n="619" who="S0013" trans="overlap"><unclear/> <unclear>crystal</unclear></u>
<u n="620" who="S0152">one of the things was how many worms could you get up in an area?</u>
<u n="621" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="622" who="S0152">and you'd have three different solution you'd have water</u>
<u n="623" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="624" who="S0152">you'd have <pause dur="short"/> washing up liquid and then you'd have a very very dilute potassium permanganate</u>
<u n="625" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="626" who="S0152">which if you got <unclear>that on</unclear> stained it purple you couldn't do that now</u>
<u n="627" who="S0012">no you couldn't do anything like that now</u>
<u n="628" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="629" who="S0152">and you used to get crystal potassium permanganate and you'd show how diffusion in water and things like that just one crystal you drop this piece of potassium permanganate in and you'd watch it</u>
<u n="630" who="S0012">grow</u>
<u n="631" who="S0152">not <trunc>gr</trunc> you'd watch all the colour come out of it</u>
<u n="632" who="S0012">oh I see right</u>
<u n="633" who="S0152">and go in the water</u>
<u n="634" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="635" who="S0013"><unclear>right</unclear></u>
<u n="636" who="S0152">so it like diffusion</u>
<u n="637" who="S0012" trans="overlap">cos we used to grow crystals too didn't we?</u>
<u n="638" who="S0152" trans="overlap">yeah yeah er in silica that was the way you did</u>
<u n="639" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="640" who="S0152"><unclear>add</unclear> some crystals and you put some silica in and</u>
<u n="641" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="642" who="S0152">and they'd grow then look at them</u>
<u n="643" who="S0012" trans="overlap">we used to leave them leave them there for about a week and what have you and you'd look at them every day and they'd all different wonderful shapes</u>
<u n="644" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="645" who="S0012">they used to grow these crystals didn't they?</u>
<u n="646" who="S0152">you can buy kits that do that now <unclear/></u>
<u n="647" who="S0012" trans="overlap">I suppose you can yeah</u>
<u n="648" who="S0013" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="649" who="S0012">but they're all safe</u>
<u n="650" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="651" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="652" who="S0152">nothing <vocal desc="laugh"/> dangerous in them</u>
<u n="653" who="S0012"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="654" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="655" who="S0012">that was that's weird how the how times change though cos <pause dur="short"/> in our science lab every <trunc>c</trunc> I don't know whether er they still have it but every <pause dur="short"/> stage was a Bunsen burner</u>
<u n="656" who="S0152">yeah still have that</u>
<u n="657" who="S0012">you still have that do you?</u>
<u n="658" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="659" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="660" who="S0152">yeah <pause dur="short"/> don't have as many but you still have them</u>
<u n="661" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="662" who="S0152">mm still have them</u>
<u n="663" who="S0012">and then <pause dur="short"/> that seemed a very very small place when I went back to <anon type="place"/> school and saw their lathes and what have you we had <trunc>m</trunc> loads of lathes Colchester students er <pause dur="short"/> can't remember them all but there was there was about five or six different lathes they we had nice big ones you know god that's how I learned all my skills in there</u>
<u n="664" who="S0152">it's just how you set the room up</u>
<u n="665" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I'm I'm sure they had more stuff more stuff in</u>
<u n="666" who="S0152">oh yeah</u>
<u n="667" who="S0012">and and they had they had a</u>
<u n="668" who="S0013" trans="overlap"><unclear>well it's er</unclear> masses of computers now isn't it?</u>
<u n="669" who="S0012">yeah in the metal work where they had the forge they had two forges</u>
<u n="670" who="S0152" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="671" who="S0012">have you <trunc>c</trunc> still got a forge?</u>
<u n="672" who="S0152">can't have them</u>
<u n="673" who="S0012">you can't have forges?</u>
<u n="674" who="S0152">you don't <vocal desc="cough"/> you don't do the stuff anymore you <trunc>c</trunc> you don't do the stuff</u>
<u n="675" who="S0012">that's how <anon type="name" nameType="m"/></u>
<u n="676" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="677" who="S0012">learned his trade</u>
<u n="678" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="679" who="S0012">I mean he made this these pokers where are they?</u>
<u n="680" who="S0152">on the side <unclear>over there</unclear>?</u>
<u n="681" who="S0013">they're there</u>
<u n="682" who="S0012">are they?</u>
<u n="683" who="S0013">this side</u>
<u n="684" who="S0152">er the one here?</u>
<u n="685" who="S0013">mm yeah</u>
<u n="686" who="S0012">which one is it? there's one here and then there's er there's one in the other room <unclear>one that look</unclear></u>
<u n="687" who="S0152">yeah</u>
<u n="688" who="S0012">he made all of that and there's another one the poker one this is <trunc>j</trunc> this is the toasting fork <vocal desc="laugh"/> but he he gave us that on our wedding anniversary weren't it?</u>
<u n="689" who="S0013">think so yeah</u>
<u n="690" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="691" who="S0152">yeah you</u>
<u n="692" who="S0013"><unclear/></u>
<u n="693" who="S0152">you can't do stuff like that now</u>
<u n="694" who="S0012">you can't do it now <pause dur="short"/> that's amazing ain't it?</u>
<u n="695" who="S0152">I mean the reason being is because they're trying to do away with it</u>
<u n="696" who="S0012">mm yeah</u>
<u n="697" who="S0152">in in the old building <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> we used to well when I first went to <anon type="place"/> as it was <pause dur="short"/> we had a <pause dur="short"/> forge which had coke in it</u>
<u n="698" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="699" who="S0152">that type of thing with a hood that came out</u>
<u n="700" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="701" who="S0152">and then we had a refurb and then we went to a ceramic one</u>
<u n="702" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="703" who="S0152">so you had ceramic er gas ceramic ones</u>
<u n="704" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="705" who="S0152">and that was alright it did but you had a little core in and the gas came round and it went through and that was that was alright</u>
<u n="706" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="707" who="S0152">erm and then you had a couple of <unclear/> hearts hearths at the side of it and then <pause dur="short"/> when I went to <anon type="place"/> we had a <unclear/> hearth and a forge that type of thing <pause dur="short"/> but if you you know it didn't wasn't on the syllabus you didn't have to teach it</u>
<u n="708" who="S0012">ah</u>
<u n="709" who="S0152">so what they what the governments do is they take stuff off</u>
<u n="710" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="711" who="S0152">therefore you don't need it</u>
<u n="712" who="S0012">that's right</u>
<u n="713" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="714" who="S0152">and then your head teacher or whatever gets some idea</u>
<u n="715" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="716" who="S0152">won't support it</u>
<u n="717" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="718" who="S0152">so it disappears</u>
<u n="719" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="720" who="S0152">it's like it's like</u>
<u n="721" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="722" who="S0012" trans="overlap">it's all these skills that that's how they've all died out though ain't it? all the skills</u>
<u n="723" who="S0013">mm mm</u>
<u n="724" who="S0012">I mean they're crying out for old skills again aren't they?</u>
<u n="725" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="726" who="S0152">I mean that's <trunc>qu</trunc> I mean that you know it that's I mean that is excellent but you know <trunc>y</trunc> if you know how to do it</u>
<u n="727" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="728" who="S0152">but the kids the the thing with that now is <trunc>th</trunc>the kids wouldn't have the patience to do it</u>
<u n="729" who="S0012">they wouldn't would they? no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="730" who="S0152">they wouldn't they wouldn't sit and I think the way that one that one is made <pause dur="short"/> is either you cut the <trunc>th</trunc>the rod into <pause dur="short"/> into little pieces</u>
<u n="731" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="732" who="S0152">so you cut the top into squares and you pull it out</u>
<u n="733" who="S0012" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="734" who="S0152">you extend it out and then you twist it round</u>
<u n="735" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="736" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="737" who="S0152">but they just <trunc>d</trunc> just don't have</u>
<u n="738" who="S0012" trans="overlap">and then you have to <unclear>scooch</unclear> it out</u>
<u n="739" who="S0152">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so you you've gotta cut in there first</u>
<u n="740" who="S0012">and the <trunc>s</trunc> the skill is to know where the <trunc>h</trunc> where you put the heat</u>
<u n="741" who="S0152">where you know it's not that it's not I mean it is <trunc>diffi</trunc> that's a difficult one to do</u>
<u n="742" who="S0012">mm</u>
<u n="743" who="S0013">mm</u>
