<u n="317" who="S0629">mm</u>
<u n="318" who="S0624">they're that like and and like the whole the mechanics the planning system makes everything so complicated that you have to like make it your full time job if you wanna do like <unclear>self-build council</unclear> housing so</u>
<u n="319" who="S0629" trans="overlap">but that's also what yeah sorry</u>
<u n="320" who="S0624">so yeah so he's but no so he's trying to unpack and like make he's <trunc>think</trunc> he's thinking about trying to do a series of lectures or something on it</u>
<u n="321" who="S0629">yeah</u>
<u n="322" who="S0624">erm</u>
<u n="323" who="S0629" trans="overlap">or you need your company to be doing that</u>
<u n="324" who="S0624">mm</u>
<u n="325" who="S0629">and if that's what you do then you know the way around the legislation</u>
<u n="326" who="S0624" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="327" who="S0629">and it's and it speeds it up</u>
<u n="328" who="S0624">mm</u>

<u n="332" who="S0624">yeah yeah I think it would be a really interesting angle for your project</u>
<u n="333" who="S0629">that that's what I'm doing anyway</u>
<u n="334" who="S0624">yeah but like I think like <unclear/></u>
<u n="335" who="S0629" trans="overlap">I just don't wanna touch legislation though I don't wanna go through with the planning</u>
<u n="336" who="S0624">no but</u>
<u n="337" who="S0629">for this</u>
<u n="338" who="S0624">if you're like if like if you like just you kind of state it as your thing like role of the architect as being like</u>
<u n="339" who="S0629">developer</u>
<u n="340" who="S0624">the developer and navigating all that shit</u>
<u n="341" who="S0629">yeah</u>
<u n="342" who="S0624">you <unclear>don't</unclear> need to do it as you do it for your project but like</u>
<u n="343" who="S0629">that's</u>
<u n="344" who="S0624">if like</u>
<u n="345" who="S0629">that's the</u>
<u n="346" who="S0624" trans="overlap">if there was <unclear/> in there</u>

<u n="351" who="S0629">why is that?</u>
<u n="352" who="S0624">because because they just because they're gonna go like they'll go they'll like interview people for the rest of it so it's not like the I think it's really good because it means that it's not self-interest</u>
<u n="353" who="S0629">right I see</u>
<u n="354" who="S0624" trans="overlap">so like lots of the CLTs things like erm lots of CLTs have it's just self-interest</u>
<u n="355" who="S0629">mm</u>
<u n="356" who="S0624">the guy who set it up he's the guy with dreadlocks who was on that film</u>

<u n="376" who="S0624">oh do they?</u>

<u n="378" who="S0624">okay</u>
<u n="379" who="S0629">and the council</u>
<u n="380" who="S0624">yes no that is true</u>
<u n="381" who="S0629">then it comes back from council</u>
<u n="382" who="S0624" trans="overlap">cos then yes that's true that's true cos that becomes a erm like that's the insurance policy</u>
<u n="383" who="S0629">yeah</u>
<u n="384" who="S0624">basically <pause dur="short"/> mm erm and erm what else was he saying he said <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> anyway loads of stuff <pause dur="long"/></u>

<u n="402" who="S0624" trans="overlap">I know I may not have</u>
<u n="403" who="S0629">is the company</u>
<u n="404" who="S0624">yeah then those two guys erm well maybe actually if you wanna speak to him while you're here</u>
<u n="405" who="S0629">er</u>

<u n="407" who="S0629">yeah</u>
<u n="408" who="S0624">but so yeah both <trunc>n</trunc> both knew both they did <anon type="place"/> village</u>
<u n="409" who="S0629" trans="overlap">I think so as far as as far as erm the course goes all I need to know is it's possible</u>
<u n="410" who="S0624">okay</u>
<u n="411" who="S0629">I think I and I think I need to make sure I don't get too tied up in the fact that it's</u>
<u n="412" who="S0624" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="413" who="S0629">there's problems with it</u>
<u n="414" who="S0624">mm</u>
<u n="415" who="S0629">because otherwise I'll end up with no architecture</u>
<u n="416" who="S0624">mm</u>
<u n="417" who="S0629">so it's just showing that there is a way to do it</u>
<u n="418" who="S0624">yeah that's very wise <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> cos that is definitely the rabbit hole that I've gone down</u>
<u n="419" who="S0629">no but I want to er at the same time I want to know cos I think it could be a possible new <unclear/> to do stuff</u>
<u n="420" who="S0624">mm</u>
<u n="421" who="S0629">so the practicalities are definitely you know <pause dur="short"/> an issue</u>
<u n="422" who="S0624">mm</u>
<u n="423" who="S0629">but I'll need to try and get more for the record like on in interviews and stuff</u>
<u n="424" who="S0624">well maybe</u>
<u n="425" who="S0629" trans="overlap">I think I need to get more about the positivities of communal living and about</u>
<u n="426" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="427" who="S0629">erm <unclear>self-build</unclear></u>
<u n="428" who="S0624">well why don't you?</u>
<u n="429" who="S0629" trans="overlap">so it's more of a promotion for what I'm doing rather than er</u>

<u n="431" who="S0629">yeah but we've got all these problems</u>
<u n="432" who="S0624">yeah</u>

<u n="439" who="S0629">although in Denmark it's quite erm <pause dur="short"/> <unclear>community</unclear> their housing into <pause dur="short"/> they're quite communal lifestyles I guess definitely not in London</u>
<u n="440" who="S0624">no it's not <pause dur="short"/> I might be like yeah it must be interesting to know like like are they just gonna like with the <anon type="place"/> ones are they just gonna do the kind of like Walter Segal self?</u>
<event desc="sound of phone"/>
<u n="441" who="S0629">say that again</u>
<u n="442" who="S0624">like I'm not entirely sure whether they're just doing the actual Walter Segal self-build</u>
<u n="443" who="S0629">whether they are? would be surprised I mean it's there's discrepancies</u>
<u n="444" who="S0624" trans="overlap">or whether they're moderating it</u>

<u n="447" who="S0629">you you would never get building <unclear>code</unclear> on it</u>
<u n="448" who="S0624">yeah</u>
<u n="449" who="S0629">that's what's a massive problem with self-builds at the moment there's been no leeway for</u>
