<u n="74" who="S0465">cos a friend of mine went there one of er his relatives was er living there and he mentioned that er apparently it's really expensive</u>
<u n="75" who="S0456" trans="overlap">it's it's it's in the firm grip of the oligarchs <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but yeah I mean even Saint Petersburg <pause dur="short"/> which is the second city and that's <pause dur="short"/> you know it's not <pause dur="short"/> expensive</u>
<u n="76" who="S0465">Saint Petersburg is not very far from Finland is it?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0456" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> we went by erm <pause dur="short"/> on the ferry</u>
<u n="78" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0456">and in one visa trip which is great because for seventy-six hours <pause dur="short"/> and it's specifically for those ferry trips</u>
<u n="80" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0456">you can go so you spend two nights <pause dur="short"/> and the hotel <pause dur="short"/> was actually owned by the by the Finnish tour operators</u>

<u n="86" who="S0465">oh right okay</u>
<u n="87" who="S0456">erm <pause dur="short"/> but yeah even the Fins need visas <pause dur="short"/> er I think theirs are <trunc>easi</trunc> more easily processed but I don't know <pause dur="short"/> but I think with with a Schengen passport you're better off than with a British passport with a British passport you have to go to the <pause dur="short"/> to London because they want biometrics</u>
<u n="88" who="S0465">oh right</u>
<u n="89" who="S0456" trans="overlap">they just think everybody's James Bond</u>

<u n="91" who="S0456"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0465">wasn't there do you know in the Second World War I think the took a massive chunk of their land was taken by Russia wasn't it? <trunc>Fi</trunc> er Finland er?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0456">well not a massive one but yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's er <pause dur="short"/> given that until the revolution all of Finland was actually Russian it's</u>
<u n="94" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0456">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> if you look because when we were in Saint Petersburg we went to <pause dur="short"/> a museum that is dedicated to the Second World War and the siege of</u>
<u n="96" who="S0465" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0456">as it was Leningrad</u>
<u n="98" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0456">you just look at the map and you know why they've done it <pause dur="short"/> because <pause dur="short"/> the Germans were <pause dur="short"/> in Finland</u>
<u n="100" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0456">and <pause dur="short"/> without that bit <pause dur="short"/> they would've had too easy access <pause dur="short"/> to get there but</u>
<u n="102" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0456">erm <pause dur="short"/> so that <pause dur="short"/> it it was like a buffer zone</u>
<u n="104" who="S0465">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0456">and of course anything that the Soviet Union got in those days they didn't want to give back did they?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0456">erm <pause dur="short"/> and you know the the the way the wars went back and forth <pause dur="short"/> and they had a civil war on top of everything else <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it it was <pause dur="short"/> slightly traumatic <pause dur="short"/> but yeah like the like the Dutch then</u>
<u n="108" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0456">the Fins keep going on about it's like well <pause dur="short"/> you know? see what you've done? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="110" who="S0465"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="111" who="S0456"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0465"><unclear>yeah that's right</unclear></u>
<u n="113" who="S0456">they're they're still <pause dur="short"/> and you now they say ah well you know? we've been occupied by by Germany <pause dur="short"/> but unlike Denmark yeah they were happily occupied by the Germans</u>
<u n="114" who="S0465" trans="overlap">oh they were happily occupied yeah?</u>

<u n="117" who="S0456">I I I know of no bit of resistance</u>
<u n="118" who="S0465">oh oh right yeah no I've seen the <unclear/> and</u>
<u n="119" who="S0456" trans="overlap">er <pause dur="short"/> they are they are still very very pro-German and obviously German was <pause dur="short"/> the first foreign language outside Swedish which was <pause dur="short"/> you know? given that they have a large <pause dur="short"/> swedish minority</u>
<u n="120" who="S0465">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0456">it's not really <pause dur="short"/> er much of a foreign language it's a foreign language because it's very unlike Finnish but so is everything apart from Estonian <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="122" who="S0465">yeah you're right yeah Norway was happy there <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="123" who="S0456" trans="overlap">but <pause dur="short"/> but yeah <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0465">I think Norway's economy in this <pause dur="short"/> crisis never affected it no?</u>
<u n="125" who="S0456">well you know they they sit on a pile oil they <trunc>w</trunc> if you think even up to the <trunc>n</trunc> sixties Norway was one of the poorest countries</u>
<u n="126" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0456">because they had really just agriculture and fishing <pause dur="short"/> and you know some industry but you know it would've been localised <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and the oil transformed it</u>
<u n="128" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0456">plus of course they were quite <pause dur="short"/> good in doing it <pause dur="short"/> thatcher used all the oil revenues to have everybody unemployed they invested it left right and centre and</u>
<u n="130" who="S0465">mm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0456">created their <pause dur="short"/> sovereign wealth fund <pause dur="short"/> and you know people said well oh you know easy for Norway a smaller country et cetera it's like well <pause dur="short"/> yeah but it was it was hopelessly wasted <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> it it's one of those things that never <pause dur="short"/> appeared much in the newspapers <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> in the mid-eighties <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> there was a question I think it was <unclear><anon type="name" nameType="m"/></unclear> today and the <unclear><anon type="name" nameType="m"/></unclear> was asked <pause dur="short"/> and then he was asked afterwards to get it edited out</u>
<u n="132" who="S0465">oh right</u>
<u n="133" who="S0456">and it was only much later that they <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> transmitted it when he was longer the er <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and I actually recorded it then because he had this massive outburst and he was saying <pause dur="short"/> look she's wasting billions and this that and the other</u>
<u n="134" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0456">he just absolutely lost his rag</u>
<u n="136" who="S0465"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
