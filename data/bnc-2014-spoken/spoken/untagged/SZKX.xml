<u n="74" who="S0465">cos a friend of mine went there one of er his relatives was er living there and he mentioned that er apparently it's really expensive</u>
<u n="75" who="S0456" trans="overlap">it's it's it's in the firm grip of the oligarchs <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but yeah I mean even Saint Petersburg <pause dur="short"/> which is the second city and that's <pause dur="short"/> you know it's not <pause dur="short"/> expensive</u>
<u n="76" who="S0465">Saint Petersburg is not very far from Finland is it?</u>
<u n="77" who="S0456" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> we went by erm <pause dur="short"/> on the ferry</u>
<u n="78" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="79" who="S0456">and in one visa trip which is great because for seventy-six hours <pause dur="short"/> and it's specifically for those ferry trips</u>
<u n="80" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="81" who="S0456">you can go so you spend two nights <pause dur="short"/> and the hotel <pause dur="short"/> was actually owned by the by the Finnish tour operators</u>

<u n="86" who="S0465">oh right okay</u>
<u n="87" who="S0456">erm <pause dur="short"/> but yeah even the Fins need visas <pause dur="short"/> er I think theirs are <trunc>easi</trunc> more easily processed but I don't know <pause dur="short"/> but I think with with a Schengen passport you're better off than with a British passport with a British passport you have to go to the <pause dur="short"/> to London because they want biometrics</u>
<u n="88" who="S0465">oh right</u>
<u n="89" who="S0456" trans="overlap">they just think everybody's James Bond</u>

<u n="91" who="S0456"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="92" who="S0465">wasn't there do you know in the Second World War I think the took a massive chunk of their land was taken by Russia wasn't it? <trunc>Fi</trunc> er Finland er?</u>
<u n="93" who="S0456">well not a massive one but yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's er <pause dur="short"/> given that until the revolution all of Finland was actually Russian it's</u>
<u n="94" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="95" who="S0456">yeah <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> if you look because when we were in Saint Petersburg we went to <pause dur="short"/> a museum that is dedicated to the Second World War and the siege of</u>
<u n="96" who="S0465" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="97" who="S0456">as it was Leningrad</u>
<u n="98" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="99" who="S0456">you just look at the map and you know why they've done it <pause dur="short"/> because <pause dur="short"/> the Germans were <pause dur="short"/> in Finland</u>
<u n="100" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="101" who="S0456">and <pause dur="short"/> without that bit <pause dur="short"/> they would've had too easy access <pause dur="short"/> to get there but</u>
<u n="102" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0456">erm <pause dur="short"/> so that <pause dur="short"/> it it was like a buffer zone</u>
<u n="104" who="S0465">mm</u>
<u n="105" who="S0456">and of course anything that the Soviet Union got in those days they didn't want to give back did they?</u>
<u n="106" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="107" who="S0456">erm <pause dur="short"/> and you know the the the way the wars went back and forth <pause dur="short"/> and they had a civil war on top of everything else <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> yeah it it was <pause dur="short"/> slightly traumatic <pause dur="short"/> but yeah like the like the Dutch then</u>
<u n="108" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="109" who="S0456">the Fins keep going on about it's like well <pause dur="short"/> you know? see what you've done? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="110" who="S0465"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="111" who="S0456"><vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0465"><unclear>yeah that's right</unclear></u>
<u n="113" who="S0456">they're they're still <pause dur="short"/> and you now they say ah well you know? we've been occupied by by Germany <pause dur="short"/> but unlike Denmark yeah they were happily occupied by the Germans</u>
<u n="114" who="S0465" trans="overlap">oh they were happily occupied yeah?</u>
<u n="115" who="S0456"><trunc>ye</trunc></u>
<u n="116" who="S0465" trans="overlap">right yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0456">I I I know of no bit of resistance</u>
<u n="118" who="S0465">oh oh right yeah no I've seen the <unclear/> and</u>
<u n="119" who="S0456" trans="overlap">er <pause dur="short"/> they are they are still very very pro-German and obviously German was <pause dur="short"/> the first foreign language outside Swedish which was <pause dur="short"/> you know? given that they have a large <pause dur="short"/> swedish minority</u>
<u n="120" who="S0465">mm</u>
<u n="121" who="S0456">it's not really <pause dur="short"/> er much of a foreign language it's a foreign language because it's very unlike Finnish but so is everything apart from Estonian <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="122" who="S0465">yeah you're right yeah Norway was happy there <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="123" who="S0456" trans="overlap">but <pause dur="short"/> but yeah <pause dur="short"/> so <pause dur="short"/> erm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0465">I think Norway's economy in this <pause dur="short"/> crisis never affected it no?</u>
<u n="125" who="S0456">well you know they they sit on a pile oil they <trunc>w</trunc> if you think even up to the <trunc>n</trunc> sixties Norway was one of the poorest countries</u>
<u n="126" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="127" who="S0456">because they had really just agriculture and fishing <pause dur="short"/> and you know some industry but you know it would've been localised <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and the oil transformed it</u>
<u n="128" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="S0456">plus of course they were quite <pause dur="short"/> good in doing it <pause dur="short"/> thatcher used all the oil revenues to have everybody unemployed they invested it left right and centre and</u>
<u n="130" who="S0465">mm</u>
<u n="131" who="S0456">created their <pause dur="short"/> sovereign wealth fund <pause dur="short"/> and you know people said well oh you know easy for Norway a smaller country et cetera it's like well <pause dur="short"/> yeah but it was it was hopelessly wasted <pause dur="short"/> and <pause dur="short"/> it it's one of those things that never <pause dur="short"/> appeared much in the newspapers <pause dur="short"/> but <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="misc"/> in the mid-eighties <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> there was a question I think it was <unclear><anon type="name" nameType="m"/></unclear> today and the <unclear><anon type="name" nameType="m"/></unclear> was asked <pause dur="short"/> and then he was asked afterwards to get it edited out</u>
<u n="132" who="S0465">oh right</u>
<u n="133" who="S0456">and it was only much later that they <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> transmitted it when he was longer the er <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> and I actually recorded it then because he had this massive outburst and he was saying <pause dur="short"/> look she's wasting billions and this that and the other</u>
<u n="134" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="135" who="S0456">he just absolutely lost his rag</u>
<u n="136" who="S0465"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="138" who="S0465">yeah</u>
<u n="139" who="S0456">and yeah nobody else said it and you know this is why he was so upset he said well you know? why why don't you ask about those things? why don't you ask them? <event desc="sound of thigh slap"/></u>
