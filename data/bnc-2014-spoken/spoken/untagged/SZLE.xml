<u n="4" who="S0510" trans="overlap">wow</u>
<u n="5" who="S0509">yeah</u>
<u n="6" who="S0510">that's pretty</u>
<u n="7" who="S0509">that's a good take up isn't it?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0510" trans="overlap">that's pretty good isn't it?</u>
<u n="9" who="S0509">yeah that's what I thought so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> fancied giving it a go anyway she was asking me if I fancy it and I said you haven't heard me sing you wouldn't want if you if you'd heard me sing you wouldn't be asking me she's going oh no but you know? you don't have to kind of be amazing it's it's all part you know? it's more of a community thing and erm anyway I said probably not but I did tell her that although I I you know? other than singing at home and being told by my husband to stop singing you know? that's how bad it is</u>
<u n="10" who="S0510" trans="overlap">ah that's bad</u>
<u n="11" who="S0509" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="12" who="S0510">if you like? if you can like match pitch a few times then you can definitely do it</u>
<u n="13" who="S0509" trans="overlap">mm aw right</u>
<u n="14" who="S0510">but it's just effort</u>
<u n="15" who="S0509">yeah well I did say to her that you'd been having singing lessons she's going oh oh singing lessons I said yeah she's got a good teacher at the guitar school which doesn't sound quite right does it?</u>

<u n="18" who="S0509">erm and she's going oh well maybe your daughter would be interested then? I said no I think she's got rather a lot on</u>
<u n="19" who="S0510" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="20" who="S0509"><vocal desc="laugh"/> just a little bit erm but anyway it's nice of her to <trunc>invit</trunc> invite me along but er I was <trunc>re</trunc> recounting her my experience of erm the only kind of singing lessons if you like or singing group stuff that I've ever done other than the school choir but I think I got thrown out for being out of tune anyway</u>
<u n="21" who="S0510"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="22" who="S0509">I <trunc>do</trunc> well I didn't get thrown out but I remember</u>
<u n="23" who="S0510">you got gently nudged towards the door</u>
<u n="24" who="S0509" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> aw I remember the erm teacher sort of saying oh kept coming round by my group where I was sort of saying there's somebody out of tune you know? I don't remember lasting much longer after that but er</u>
<u n="25" who="S0510" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="misc"/> ah</u>
<u n="26" who="S0509">whether that was my choice or hers is lost in the mist of time but <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="27" who="S0510">ah</u>
<u n="28" who="S0509">but anyway erm I was telling her about yoga and singing</u>
<u n="29" who="S0510">mm I thought that was where this was going</u>
<u n="30" who="S0509" trans="overlap">mm and erm cos she was saying to me you don't have to be that good and it's amazing if you've got a good teacher and all the rest of it er and I said about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> being a brilliant yoga teacher and a brilliant singing teacher as well cos she does all those community choirs doesn't she? erm and just cos she thought it was a bizarre combination yoga and singing I said ah it's not that strange because</u>
<u n="31" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="32" who="S0509">what she used to do was you know loosen up the muscles in your neck and in your diaphragm and</u>
<u n="33" who="S0510">yeah what what's her book called Jumbala or something</u>
<u n="34" who="S0509">er Jumbalani</u>
<u n="35" who="S0510">Jumbalani</u>
<u n="36" who="S0509">Jumbalani yeah and erm and so that really helped prepare for getting sounds out and as I was saying to her you didn't have to well in fact you're sort of <trunc>deter</trunc> you know? deterred? what's the word? erm</u>
<u n="37" who="S0510">discouraged?</u>
<u n="38" who="S0509">went away from yeah not discouraged can't think can't think anyway</u>
<u n="39" who="S0510" trans="overlap">mm I know what you mean</u>
<u n="40" who="S0509">from singing something that was known to everybody because you kind of almost take on an affectation of how you think it should sound</u>
<u n="41" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="42" who="S0509">and so she was very clever in that what she did when she got us all singing together was erm get us singing in another language you know?</u>
<u n="43" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0509">so a lot of it was sort of African tribal folk sort of singing which you know? again you couldn't associate particular words with particular feelings or whatever so it was just more the sounds of the words</u>
<u n="45" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="46" who="S0509">and so it was getting the the voice and you know? everything working to get that sound erm <vocal desc="misc"/> and and then she'd be very canny about placing us once she got us all doing certain notes or certain phrases erm <pause dur="short"/> she'd listen and then she might mix us round a little bit because she'd figure out who were the you know?</u>
<u n="47" who="S0510" trans="overlap">oh</u>
<u n="48" who="S0509">baritones who were the sopranos and all the rest of it</u>
<u n="49" who="S0510" trans="overlap">sopranos <unclear/></u>
<u n="50" who="S0509">yeah and then get it so that we were all positioned where we could bounce off one another better</u>
<u n="51" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah nice</u>
<u n="52" who="S0509">and and it never failed to surprise me at the end of each session when we did our joint you know? number as it were erm even if it was just a chant of some kind</u>
<u n="53" who="S0510">yeah</u>
<u n="54" who="S0509">just the incredible depth and resonance of the sounds that were coming out of all of us really you know?</u>
<u n="55" who="S0510">mm</u>
<u n="56" who="S0509">well you must find that with your singing teacher and some of the exercises he teaches you</u>
<u n="57" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah <trunc>wh</trunc> <trunc>wh</trunc> yeah just some of them are so weird the exercises you have to do like monkey <unclear>hoos</unclear> like I can't do it sitting down</u>

<u n="410" who="S0509"><unclear>ah right</unclear></u>
<u n="411" who="S0510" trans="overlap">because there's kind of the play is like kind of almost <trunc>to</trunc> there's there's like the main bit but then there's like another like quarter of it that sort of slots in that's not really that much about the main bit</u>

<u n="422" who="S0509"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="423" who="S0510">probably <vocal desc="laugh"/> cos it's got to be short it's not it's not meant to be a long play</u>

<u n="426" who="S0509" trans="overlap">ah okay</u>
<u n="427" who="S0510">so I don't know what what order we're going to be in</u>

<u n="434" who="S0509">right mm</u>
<u n="435" who="S0510">yeah it's like I think there's only one other group though so there might be two of us so it's like two to four other plays apart from ours</u>

<u n="437" who="S0510" trans="overlap"><unclear/></u>
<u n="438" who="S0509"><unclear/> <vocal desc="yawn"/></u>
<u n="439" who="S0510">I <trunc>th</trunc> no it must it must just be two others cos they've made a set that has to work for three plays</u>
<u n="440" who="S0509">ah</u>
<u n="441" who="S0510" trans="overlap">like I'm genuinely impressed with what our teachers have well with what our main teacher at the moment has managed to come up with for that</u>
<u n="442" who="S0509" trans="overlap">really?</u>
<u n="443" who="S0510">cos to make the same set work for three plays is like a feat</u>

<u n="448" who="S0509">you know the scene changes in that I thought that was really inventive the way they put them on erm you know roller roller well rollers basically and just switched them you know so that it was</u>
<u n="449" who="S0510" trans="overlap">yeah yeah but we <trunc>do</trunc> I can't even do that really</u>
<u n="450" who="S0509">no so it's got to be <unclear/></u>
<u n="451" who="S0510" trans="overlap"><unclear>I think we might have some flats</unclear></u>
<u n="452" who="S0509">so how are they differentiating then between each play? are they just adding a little few props to sort of</u>

<u n="454" who="S0509">mm</u>
<u n="455" who="S0510">and we've got chairs that come up the sides but like we've got the chalk circle on the stage that's our bit</u>
<u n="456" who="S0509">right</u>
<u n="457" who="S0510">and then one of the other plays has fencing at the back and then one of the other plays has all these crates at the back but we use the crates in our play as well and we keep stuff inside of them</u>
<u n="458" who="S0509" trans="overlap">oh okay mm</u>
<u n="459" who="S0510">and then there's the archway which is for us and I think another play need it as well</u>
