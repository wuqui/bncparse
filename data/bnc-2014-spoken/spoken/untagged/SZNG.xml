<u n="354" who="S0013">they might do won't they?</u>
<u n="355" who="S0008">but the worst thing is it's at the food bank I mean it's bad enough stigma <pause dur="short"/> you know</u>
<u n="356" who="S0012">to have to go</u>
<u n="357" who="S0008"><unclear/> don't you? but other people</u>

<u n="367" who="S0008">yeah but see a lot of people they're either paying <unclear/> or even worse than that they lived with massive great debts</u>
<u n="368" who="S0012">yeah do yeah yeah</u>
<u n="369" who="S0013">mm yeah</u>
<u n="370" who="S0008">and er if their income source is suddenly cut off</u>
<u n="371" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="372" who="S0008">it doesn't matter if you've got a Range Rover and a big house and that you can still blooming starve to death</u>
<u n="373" who="S0012">you can yeah</u>
<u n="374" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="375" who="S0008">unless you sell your Range Rover or</u>
<u n="376" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="377" who="S0008">but then a lot of the time these Range Rovers are are on the never never anyway</u>
<u n="378" who="S0012">yeah that's true yeah</u>
<u n="379" who="S0008">and even if they handed them back they probably wouldn't get any money</u>
<u n="380" who="S0012">not get any money no</u>
<u n="381" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="382" who="S0012">no <pause dur="long"/></u>
<u n="383" who="S0008">I mean it's just <unclear/> like the man has got you</u>
<u n="384" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="385" who="S0008">yeah you know really you know unless you keep grafting and keeping your nose to the stone</u>
<u n="386" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="387" who="S0008">if you fall for all this advertising</u>
<u n="388" who="S0012">oh crikey yeah</u>
<u n="389" who="S0008">and you know all this two holidays a year and don't you deserve this? and you know this new car and stuff like this</u>
<u n="390" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="391" who="S0008">you know I mean you can I mean these people just walk blindly</u>
<u n="392" who="S0012">they do</u>
<u n="393" who="S0008">you know their head is in the noose and you know one thing they can't kick against the system because they are rely they need the job</u>
<u n="394" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="395" who="S0008">you know to get the income</u>
<u n="396" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="397" who="S0008">and so that keeps them quiet that way and the other thing is is that the people who own these companies you know they can have a board meeting in America oh we'll close that company that and close that down</u>
<u n="398" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="399" who="S0008">and suddenly you get you know three or four hundred people on the you know with nothing</u>
<u n="400" who="S0012">well it's like Tesco's and BP now innit?</u>
<u n="401" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="402" who="S0012">huh? look what they're now done I mean they're now BP has now sacked loads of people</u>
<u n="403" who="S0008">mm</u>
<u n="404" who="S0012">because <trunc>ho</trunc> oil price has gone down and Tesco's are now not building what they said they were going to build and Wolverhampton I think is one of the places they'll go</u>
<u n="405" who="S0008">they're closing down big stores and that</u>
<u n="406" who="S0012">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="407" who="S0008">and you know no matter what people say about these stores they do provide a good income for a lot of people who wouldn't necessarily get a job anywhere else</u>
<u n="408" who="S0012">that's right yeah I mean the</u>
<u n="409" who="S0008">if you look at the sad acts who live in who work in Morrison's</u>
<u n="410" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="411" who="S0008">you know they'd never work anywhere else would they?</u>
<u n="412" who="S0012">no they wouldn't no no <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but the problem is I mean they brought it on their selves Tesco's and Sainsbury's and all these other people who haven't deliveries you just <trunc>ph</trunc>phone up phone up or put em on the net they deliver it to you next day for three or four quid well that saves you going to the shop and spending two or three hours shopping</u>
<u n="413" who="S0008">that's right I don't think these companies someone like Tesco's I don't yeah they reckon they've got masses massive land bank</u>
<u n="414" who="S0012">they have land bank and <unclear/> Sainsbury's isn't it?</u>
<u n="415" who="S0008">like bought up land with the the idea of maybe they'll build stores on them</u>
<u n="416" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="417" who="S0008">but I don't think that they're worried at all cos they can turn that into a housing for even more money</u>
<u n="418" who="S0012">well of course they can even more yeah</u>
<u n="419" who="S0008">and I think even like you know when they're sort of building stores and that I think half the company is is interested in expanding the stores and the stuff like that</u>
<u n="420" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="421" who="S0008">and the other half of the company</u>
<u n="422" who="S0012">just in it for the money</u>
<u n="423" who="S0008">are building up real estate</u>
<u n="424" who="S0012">money money money</u>
<u n="425" who="S0008">you know because they're not gonna lose out are they?</u>
<u n="426" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="427" who="S0008">you got all that real estate</u>
<u n="428" who="S0012">that's right</u>
<u n="429" who="S0008">and they you can turn it you know look at <trunc>Sains</trunc> er Tesco's in <anon type="place"/> right?</u>
<u n="430" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="431" who="S0008">if they close that down they could build massive great industrial estate there</u>
<u n="432" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="433" who="S0008">in that same area</u>
<u n="434" who="S0012">and look at the housing they could get there?</u>
<u n="435" who="S0008">or houses or anything I mean</u>
<u n="436" who="S0012">yeah yeah I mean it's a huge car park innit?</u>
<u n="437" who="S0008">it is absolutely massive</u>
<u n="438" who="S0012">massive car park</u>
<u n="439" who="S0008">yeah and where they build the stores they're only built out of tick tack aren't they?</u>
<u n="440" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="441" who="S0008">they're like you know steel sheds</u>
<u n="442" who="S0012">yeah with a with a roof on <unclear/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="443" who="S0008">I mean when we used to build erm you know units work units</u>
<u n="444" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="445" who="S0008">you knew you knew that they're only being built for the short term</u>
<u n="446" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="447" who="S0008">you know cos of how cheap they're built you know it's just like frames with a bit of metal cladding that you can unbolt and you can take them down in a day</u>
<u n="448" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="449" who="S0008">unbolt and take them offsite</u>
<u n="450" who="S0012">that's right yeah</u>
<u n="451" who="S0008">cos it's only nuts and bolt holding them together</u>
<u n="452" who="S0012">there's there's a <anon type="place"/> green they've still got them units up there hadn't they?</u>
<u n="453" who="S0008">they've got plenty of units up <anon type="place"/> green</u>
<u n="454" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="455" who="S0008">keep expanding it as well</u>
<u n="456" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="457" who="S0008">but yeah I was sort of thinking you know <pause dur="short"/> you know it's sort of you know when we were you you know like in our twenties and that you looked at houses what were built at the turn of the century</u>
<u n="458" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="459" who="S0008">and they were sort of like getting pretty old weren't they?</u>
<u n="460" who="S0012">they were yeah</u>
<u n="461" who="S0008">they were sort of falling to bits and that</u>
<u n="462" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="463" who="S0008">and er so that'd be that'd be about seventy year old then</u>
<u n="464" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="465" who="S0008">whereas now seventy year old houses are the ones built after the war</u>
<u n="466" who="S0012">just after the war yeah</u>
<u n="467" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="468" who="S0008">you know and but you'd think oh that's quite a new house but I mean</u>
<u n="469" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="470" who="S0008">well so the one built just off ever since then the the the materials have been of poorer quality haven't they?</u>
<u n="471" who="S0012">that's right yeah yeah</u>
<u n="472" who="S0008">I mean the admittedly there's a lot of houses built in the nineteen hundreds were not very good</u>
<u n="473" who="S0012">right then the thirties were supposed to be the best best built houses and of course they became</u>
<u n="474" who="S0008">I mean I mean you know they put all the drains are you know plastic piping now</u>
<u n="475" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="476" who="S0008">well who's to say that in a hundred years' time they had to all sort of go and get you know just sort of crumble away into nothing</u>
<u n="477" who="S0012">that's right</u>
<u n="478" who="S0008">they're just assuming that plastic was gonna last forever</u>
<u n="479" who="S0012">they are yeah</u>
<u n="480" who="S0008">and you're thinking well they don't know because it hasn't been invented that long</u>
<u n="481" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="482" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="483" who="S0013">right</u>
<u n="484" who="S0008">you know what I mean? and what would happen if like all the plastic parts in all the houses</u>
<u n="485" who="S0012">the plastic plumbing yeah</u>
<u n="486" who="S0008">all started you know like decaying</u>
<u n="487" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="488" who="S0008">due to you know I don't know</u>
<u n="489" who="S0012">the lead did years ago didn't it?</u>
<u n="490" who="S0008">yeah that's right it crumbles away</u>
<u n="491" who="S0012">that crumbled away doesn't it? and people's people's water <trunc>sy</trunc>systems were built on lead pipes</u>
<u n="492" who="S0008">that's right</u>
<u n="493" who="S0012">it's scary that</u>
<u n="494" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="495" who="S0012">no wonder there's a lot of mental people in the world</u>
<u n="496" who="S0008">yeah well they reckon this area's alright cos of the calcium</u>
<u n="497" who="S0012">the hard water yeah</u>
<u n="498" who="S0008">the hard water would put a layer of calcium on the inside</u>
<u n="499" who="S0012">that's right</u>
<u n="500" who="S0008">to protect it</u>
<u n="501" who="S0012">yeah</u>

<u n="503" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="504" who="S0008">then like the soft water actually makes the lead <trunc>di</trunc>dissolve in the water</u>
<u n="505" who="S0012">yeah that's right yeah</u>
<u n="506" who="S0013">oh dear yeah</u>

<u n="525" who="S0012">I see yeah</u>
<u n="526" who="S0008">so this meter was off and apparently there's some new system where they've got to take the top corrugated pipe out and put a solid pipe in so it's rigid like</u>
<u n="527" who="S0012">oh right</u>
<u n="528" who="S0008">god knows why anyway he did this and made a right mess of sort of soldering up and this sort of stuff</u>

<u n="534" who="S0008">and er nothing much you couldn't smell it outside but if you opened the door to read the meter mm smells a bit of gas</u>

<u n="579" who="S0012">was in <anon type="place"/> point?</u>
<u n="580" who="S0013">there's been a street something</u>
<u n="581" who="S0012">well it collapsed and oh no that was at the it collapsed and</u>
<u n="582" who="S0008">yes it was wasn't it? yes</u>
<u n="583" who="S0012">not not the one down it was <anon type="place"/> point wasn't it? that got blown up</u>

<u n="587" who="S0012">was all collapsed yeah</u>
<u n="588" who="S0008">yeah but I think anyway he comes along and er he checked it with all this sort of super fine stuff and oh yeah there was this pinhole leak in this bit of pipe and he took it out and I said oh can I have a look at it yeah what for? I said I just want to see what's wrong you know and this bit of corrugated pipe is sort of the you know</u>
<u n="589" who="S0013">yes</u>
<u n="590" who="S0008">it's stainless steel right</u>
<u n="591" who="S0012">well</u>
<u n="592" who="S0008">and what had happened is is that some solder and some flux from the connection at the top had dripped down and stuck on a bit of this corrugation and rotted straight through it</u>
<u n="593" who="S0012">wow</u>
<u n="594" who="S0013">ooh</u>
<u n="595" who="S0012">rotted through the stainless steel</u>
<u n="596" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="597" who="S0013">that's not good is it?</u>
<u n="598" who="S0012">wow</u>
<u n="599" who="S0008">and I said he he said oh yeah it's someone made a messy joint there you know that the flux come down and rotted through and I'm thinking well that can't have been that guy in August cos no way would flux go through a bit of stainless steel in <trunc>the</trunc></u>
<u n="600" who="S0012">no</u>
<u n="601" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="602" who="S0008">in you know such a short time</u>
<u n="603" who="S0013">mm</u>
<u n="604" who="S0008">and you think well it's stainless steel anyway you'd have thought yeah it should be impervious to a bit of I mean flux is acid but I mean yeah there's isn't that much acid there and once the acidic properties are used up there's got to you know it's just limited innit?</u>
<u n="605" who="S0013">yeah</u>
<u n="606" who="S0012">no you you talk about stainless steel I read on the internet that er you should only buy you should only use American or British or European stainless steel right because they don't they buy from China and that doesn't contain the amount of chromium that it's supposed to contain</u>
<u n="607" who="S0008">oh yeah</u>
<u n="608" who="S0012">to <trunc>st</trunc> to call it stainless still so they get little pit marks of rust in them</u>
<u n="609" who="S0008">right</u>
<u n="610" who="S0012">because it's done a lot cheaper</u>
<u n="611" who="S0008">mm yeah I can believe that so I mean if you if you're getting a place like British Gas buying all their stainless steel from China</u>
<u n="612" who="S0008">yeah they have these things made in China</u>
<u n="613" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="614" who="S0008">which they probably would have done</u>
<u n="615" who="S0012">which they probably would have done yeah</u>
<u n="616" who="S0008">yeah but it's but then that's their fault for not specifying it properly innit?</u>
<u n="617" who="S0012">yeah that is yeah</u>
<u n="618" who="S0008">you know if they just specify the stainless steel it probably is stainless on the</u>
<u n="619" who="S0012">that is yeah that's right</u>
<u n="620" who="S0008">stainless in China</u>
<u n="621" who="S0012">yeah</u>
<u n="622" who="S0008">it's just very susceptible to</u>
<u n="623" who="S0012">that's right certain types of hazard</u>
<u n="624" who="S0008">I mean stainless steel you see it's a funny thing it's you can make an infinite variety of stainless steels</u>
<u n="625" who="S0012">yes you can</u>
<u n="626" who="S0008">well depending on what proportion of what metals you're add to it</u>
<u n="627" who="S0012">you use yeah</u>
<u n="628" who="S0008">yeah</u>
<u n="629" who="S0012">and that was stainless steel was only made by a mistake wasn't it? it was a mistake</u>
<u n="630" who="S0008">yeah yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u n="631" who="S0012">which was you know lots lots of brilliant inventions were made by a mistake aren't they? you know people leave something</u>
<u n="632" who="S0008">well that was on that materials programme wasn't it?</u>
<u n="633" who="S0012">yeah that's right yeah</u>

<u n="1969" who="S0008">yeah I'm sure they have</u>
<u n="1970" who="S0012">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I mean the British the British productivity has gone up a lot since a a few years ago</u>
