<u n="134" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">so you really should practise them I just never can be bothered to practise them because scales are so always the boring</u>
<u n="136" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="137" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">bit of playing a clarinet</u>

<u n="140" who="S0325" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">awful at aural</u>
<u n="141" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">I always used to be really good at the aural cos then it was just the easy questions like</u>
<u n="142" who="S0325" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">mm <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="143" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">sing back and clap back</u>

<u n="146" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="147" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">and it's <trunc>s</trunc>sight sing and</u>
<u n="148" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">yeah but I I was always really nervous and so they'd be like sing and I would just be like oh</u>
<u n="149" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low"><shift new="singing"/> <unclear/> <shift new="normal"/></u>

<u n="152" who="S0325" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/> but then I was really annoyed because in grade six I didn't even get the clapping right and the clapping</u>

<u n="154" who="S0325" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">was the bit I could always rely on and I'd be like</u>
<u n="155" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0325" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">if I don't get anything right in this aural the clapping I've got the clapping and then it was like clapping was incorrect</u>
<u n="157" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="158" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">it was so sad <vocal desc="laugh"/> so oh</u>

<u n="160" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="161" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">because well I always used to be fine in the earlier grades but like in my grade five the clapping is longer</u>
<u n="162" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">and I always forget the middle so I just make it up</u>
<u n="164" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">mm</u>
<u n="165" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/> and then end</u>
<u n="166" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">I don't actually think I'm gonna be able to take grade eight because if you look at the like the pieces are fine because you just learn to do the pieces like you can practise them</u>
<u n="167" who="S0324" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="168" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">until you can do them and like scales but when it comes to the aural and stuff and the sight reading it's so hard</u>
<u n="169" who="S0324" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">yeah then in grade eight aural is</u>
<u n="170" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">er even in grade seven it's</u>
<u n="171" who="S0324" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">it's</u>
<u n="172" who="S0325" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">impossible all the stuff that I need to know he was like you need to know you need to be able to tell like what cadence it is? so if you say it's a perfect cadence you need to be able to say two to five or like whatever it is and then <vocal desc="laugh"/> you need to be able to like right right there you just need to be like oh yeah perfect one to five and then you need to be able to say like erm what else was it? you need to be able to need to <trunc>s</trunc> know the progression so they play a piece and it progresses and so it either progresses like diminished or major or minor and you need to be able to tell like</u>
<u n="173" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="sigh"/></u>
<u n="174" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">how it's progressed <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="555" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">yeah how are you <trunc>su</trunc> because then at least with the creative task you get like a beginning</u>
<u n="556" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">or something to work on with that</u>

<u n="565" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">I'll just end up like accidentally copying a piece that I always play</u>
<u n="566" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low"><vocal desc="laugh"/> yeah</u>
<u n="567" who="S0324" trans="overlap" whoConfidence="low">on my <unclear/> yeah</u>
<u n="568" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">but surely you could just a do a piece</u>
<u n="569" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">yeah</u>
<u n="570" who="S0325" whoConfidence="low">and nobody would notice actually they would notice as long as you don't do a famous piece or just get him to compose a piece for you and you can play it</u>
<u n="571" who="S0324" whoConfidence="low">yeah yeah</u>
