<u n="28" who="S0058">um <pause dur="short"/> but you know that was fairly standard Magnum fair but then he dropped her off at her house and um like the nice twin sister he dropped her off at her house <pause dur="short"/> and um then you <trunc>re</trunc> like <trunc>y</trunc> you you sort of had a view of like from behind like a wall like that so you could see them <pause dur="short"/> so there was someone in the house and you're like oh my God <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> And then you left her there in the house <pause dur="short"/> um and <trunc>sh</trunc> and then the end er so it ended with her ringing him going I think I've <trunc>k</trunc> er I think I've killed someone <pause dur="short"/> can you come round and like help? Um and you were like oh my God <pause dur="short"/> um but they search the house and there's no trace of any blood <pause dur="short"/> any body <pause dur="short"/> anything at all <pause dur="short"/> and it was like uh what's happened? You know <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and it kind of oh you know the tension ramped up and ramped up <pause dur="short"/> and then there's a scene you know the <trunc>per</trunc> er the er you <trunc>c</trunc> you knew there was someone in a cupboard watching Magnum in the shower through this cupboard <pause dur="short"/> and it was properly scary and horrible <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but then it transpired just to make matters worse that the the other twin the nasty twin well the the the second twin sister had actually been killed when they were kidnapped <pause dur="short"/> and this other the first twin had multiple personality disorder and had been sort of doing both of them <pause dur="short"/> and it was just <trunc>h</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> really horrible <pause dur="short"/> er you know <pause dur="short"/> and sort of quite dark <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but not at all</u>

And then watched the next episode and we were like oh it's alright <pause dur="short"/> he's back <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> But it was such a tour de force <pause dur="short"/> it was great <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> it was really good <pause dur="short"/> couldn't sleep <vocal desc="laugh"/> that night <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="43" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0058">half an hour everything happens type thing</u>
<u n="45" who="S0120">yeah <pause dur="short"/> twenty hours</u>
<u n="46" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="47" who="S0120">everything happens</u>

<u n="52" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="53" who="S0120">they're not gonna be making any more series</u>

<u n="58" who="S0058">oh <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0120">but um yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was quite traumatic <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> I quite like stuff like that though <pause dur="short"/> where you <trunc>wa</trunc> you at the end of it you're just like oh my God <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh</u>
<u n="61" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="62" who="S0058">er it's it's it's always good if it's actually had an effect on you rather than being like oh it's okay <pause dur="short"/> next</u>
<u n="63" who="S0120">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="64" who="S0058">which is a tendency with a lot of <trunc>t</trunc> like cos er yeah Friends is a classic example <pause dur="short"/> doesn't you know you turn it off and you never think about it ever again <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="65" who="S0120">well</u>
<u n="66" who="S0058">well</u>

<u n="72" who="S0058">have you seen Let Me In? <unclear/> or Let The Right One In? It's a vampire film <pause dur="short"/> but it's um it's so not a typical vampire film <pause dur="short"/> and that's the <trunc>s</trunc> another sort of one of these things where just <vocal desc="laugh"/> really really disturbing it wasn't even that scary it was just it's about this you know young girl vampire</u>
<u n="73" who="S0120">and it's called Let Me In?</u>
<u n="74" who="S0058">um um yes it's it's a it's an American remake on Let Me In it's an American remake of the Swedish film which has the title um Let The Right One In <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="75" who="S0120">oh right</u>
<u n="76" who="S0058">which is <unclear/> Um</u>
<u n="77" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="78" who="S0058">the basic premise being that a vampire can't enter your house unless you invite them in</u>
<u n="79" who="S0120">which I know because I watched one episode of Being Human ever</u>
<u n="80" who="S0058">I haven't seen that</u>
<u n="81" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="82" who="S0058">bBC3 isn't it? Yeah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0120">it wasn't bad with one er from that one episode <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="84" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="85" who="S0120">but er I'm not gonna get into it</u>

<u n="88" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="89" who="S0120">hm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0058">no it's</u>
<u n="91" who="S0120">another one</u>
<u n="92" who="S0058">I won't spoil it <pause dur="short"/> but that's just massively upsetting <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="93" who="S0120">right <pause dur="short"/> more Scandinavian TV</u>
<u n="94" who="S0058">it's a</u>
<u n="95" who="S0120">film</u>
<u n="96" who="S0058">film rather than</u>
<u n="97" who="S0120">film</u>
<u n="98" who="S0058">yeah but it's um</u>
<u n="99" who="S0120">okay <pause dur="short"/> but still</u>
<u n="100" who="S0058">it's er apparently it's an almost if you er well I've we I've only seen the American one <pause dur="short"/> but apparently it's an almost shot for shot remake <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="101" who="S0120">oh that's good <pause dur="short"/> unlike all other</u>
<u n="102" who="S0058">so</u>
<u n="103" who="S0120">american remakes</u>
<u n="104" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> which kind of begs the question why remake it? But I guess because Americans <trunc>w</trunc> a lot of Americans won't watch films with subtitles</u>
<u n="105" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="106" who="S0058">slash Peter <vocal desc="laugh"/> won't watch films with subtitles <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Slash</u>

<u n="116" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="117" who="S0120">thirty seconds <pause dur="short"/> and then for the rest of the film</u>
<u n="118" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="119" who="S0120">you just take it in</u>
<u n="120" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="121" who="S0120">as speech <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="122" who="S0058">exactly</u>
<u n="123" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0058">I think there's associations of work <pause dur="short"/> you know having to  you know having to  think er more than you should have to <pause dur="short"/> but you know</u>
<u n="125" who="S0120">depends how easily you can read</u>
<u n="126" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="127" who="S0120">I suppose</u>
<u n="128" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="129" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="130" who="S0058">if you're watching subtitles in a language other than your own then yes it's probably quite difficult</u>
<u n="131" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="132" who="S0058">oo <pause dur="short"/> but um <pause dur="short"/> I quite</u>
<u n="133" who="S0120">it's sometimes helpful to have German subtitles</u>
<u n="134" who="S0058"><unclear/> On?</u>
<u n="135" who="S0120">my my dad definitely finds it helpful having subtitles <pause dur="short"/> even if they are in German <pause dur="short"/> for German</u>
<u n="136" who="S0058">oh</u>
<u n="137" who="S0120">watching German films</u>
<u n="138" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> I see</u>
<u n="139" who="S0120">Cos er</u>
<u n="140" who="S0058"><unclear/></u>
<u n="141" who="S0120">cos <trunc>i</trunc> if you just can't then catch <unclear/></u>
<u n="142" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's true</u>
<u n="143" who="S0120">catch the words</u>
<u n="144" who="S0058">it's easier to to read than er</u>
<u n="145" who="S0120">than yeah <pause dur="short"/> rather than having a continuous line of sound <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="146" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="147" who="S0120">you can see the separate words</u>
<u n="148" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I guess if someone's got quite a strong regional accent</u>
<u n="149" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="150" who="S0058">or <pause dur="short"/> I often think about that if um if there's like you know an English film where someone's got a very strong Yorkshire accent or a very strong London accent <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> subtitling it must be er must be fun</u>
<u n="151" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="152" who="S0058">is your dad like fluent in German then or? Er you know is it kind of</u>

<u n="160" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="161" who="S0120">Cos that requires a bit more <pause dur="short"/> that requires you to</u>
<u n="162" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="163" who="S0120">be used to putting the words in the right order <pause dur="short"/> whereas</u>

<u n="527" who="S0120">my desk</u>
<u n="528" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I don't know how they're gonna arrange it <pause dur="short"/> whether they're gonna give like the important people the windows <pause dur="short"/> or whether they're just gonna <pause dur="short"/> or whether because we're slightly miscellaneous we'll end up on an edge</u>
<u n="529" who="S0120">ah</u>
<u n="530" who="S0058">also known as by the window <pause dur="short"/> which is what has happened at the minute I think <pause dur="short"/> which is really good <pause dur="short"/> it's the best seats in the house</u>
<u n="531" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="532" who="S0058">so I'm kind of got my fingers crossed for that <pause dur="short"/> but Anne's like really <unclear/> er so she's you know looking round and talking to people and finding out what's going on <pause dur="short"/> and making sure we've got enough cupboards <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> Being really useful about the whole thing <pause dur="short"/> so I don't need to er worry <vocal desc="laugh"/> too much about it <pause dur="short"/> I know I'll get the storage space</u>
<u n="533" who="S0120"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="534" who="S0058">ah <pause dur="short"/> oh I'm I'm actually heating up <pause dur="short"/> this is lovely <pause dur="short"/> right <pause dur="short"/> that is staying at home tomorrow</u>
<u n="535" who="S0120">I should've worn a black shirt</u>
<u n="536" who="S0058">A what shirt?</u>
<u n="537" who="S0120">I should've worn a black shirt</u>
<u n="538" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yes</u>
<u n="539" who="S0120">my legs are heating up more than my body</u>
<u n="540" who="S0058">uh</u>
<u n="541" who="S0120">hm <pause dur="short"/> so er yeah there are murmurings <pause dur="short"/> admittedly coming from the er unit managing director <pause dur="short"/> so probably quite um <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="542" who="S0058">quite loud <trunc>mur</trunc></u>
<u n="543" who="S0120">er authoritative</u>
<u n="544" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="545" who="S0120">murmurings <pause dur="short"/> that er we might be our building might be getting a strip-down and rebuilt</u>
<u n="546" who="S0058">oh you did tell me this</u>
<u n="547" who="S0120">in like several years</u>
<u n="548" who="S0058">er leaving the outside up but stripping it</u>
<u n="549" who="S0120">well not necessarily even the outside</u>
<u n="550" who="S0058">or completely</u>
<u n="551" who="S0120">they're just leaving the structural elements <pause dur="short"/> like the frame</u>
<u n="552" who="S0058">oh okay</u>
<u n="553" who="S0120">or whatever</u>
<u n="554" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> and taking all the walls out?</u>
<u n="555" who="S0120">um <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and extending the floors so that it's a wider building</u>
<u n="556" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="557" who="S0120">which means a <trunc>f</trunc> lower percentage of people get window space I I guess</u>
<u n="558" who="S0058">if er yeah</u>
<u n="559" who="S0120">but</u>
<u n="560" who="S0058">if it's wider and shorter then yeah</u>
<u n="561" who="S0120">the idea would be to basically make it all new energy-efficient et cetera  et cetera</u>
<u n="562" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="563" who="S0120">and it would be they'd add a floor on the top <pause dur="short"/> and they'd fill in the ground floor <pause dur="short"/> which is currently cos the building's on stilts</u>
<u n="564" who="S0058">right <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="565" who="S0120">basically <pause dur="short"/> it's currently car park down there <pause dur="short"/> they'd fill in the ground floor</u>
<u n="566" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="567" who="S0120">um</u>
<u n="568" who="S0058">with just <unclear/>?</u>
<u n="569" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="570" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="571" who="S0120">um <pause dur="short"/> so then we'd have six floors <pause dur="short"/> they'd be wider floors</u>
<u n="572" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="573" who="S0120">and you could get all of Mott's staff into that one building rather than split across three buildings</u>
<u n="574" who="S0058">oh okay</u>
<u n="575" who="S0120">um</u>
<u n="576" who="S0058">what just like are they further down the road or something do you mean or?</u>
<u n="577" who="S0120">well there's we've got one floor in twenty Station Road</u>
<u n="578" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Right</u>
<u n="579" who="S0120">and we've got er it's not quite so comparable but <anon type="place"/> right next to the station</u>
<u n="580" who="S0058">yes</u>
<u n="581" who="S0120">you know where the steps up</u>
<u n="582" who="S0058">yes <pause dur="short"/> I do <pause dur="short"/> yes there's er yeah</u>
<u n="583" who="S0120">next to the roundabout?</u>
<u n="584" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="585" who="S0120">er we've er got all of that <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="586" who="S0058">oh</u>
<u n="587" who="S0120">with the er buildings and infrastructure and health and education units</u>
<u n="588" who="S0058">aha</u>
<u n="589" who="S0120">um</u>
<u n="590" who="S0058">isn't <anon type="place"/> in there?</u>
<u n="591" who="S0120">not <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="592" who="S0058">is it not?</u>
<u n="593" who="S0120">it's <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="594" who="S0058">oh right</u>
<u n="595" who="S0120">which is the education division of <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="596" who="S0058"><unclear/> I'm sure <anon type="place"/> has something to do with</u>
<u n="597" who="S0120">so <anon type="place"/> yeah <anon type="place"/> I'm not sure how <anon type="place"/> started up</u>
<u n="598" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="599" who="S0120">but it's been er it it's now part of <anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="600" who="S0058">right</u>
<u n="601" who="S0120">um</u>
<u n="602" who="S0058">so it's probably connected to <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> hence connected to CUP <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="603" who="S0120">I'm not sure</u>
<u n="604" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> I'm sure we talked about this before and found that it was actually <unclear/></u>
<u n="605" who="S0120">I might have to</u>
<u n="606" who="S0058">I can't remember</u>
<u n="607" who="S0120">wikipedia it</u>
<u n="608" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="609" who="S0120">or something</u>
<u n="610" who="S0058">there might be no connection at all</u>
<u n="611" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="612" who="S0058">I suppose</u>
<u n="613" who="S0120">but yeah <pause dur="short"/> so maybe in about a year's time they</u>
<u n="614" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="615" who="S0120">will get around to implementing that plan</u>
<u n="616" who="S0058">where will you all go?</u>
<u n="617" who="S0120">I don't know</u>
<u n="618" who="S0058">Cos that's the  that's the  kind of</u>
<u n="619" who="S0120">temporary locations</u>
<u n="620" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="621" who="S0120">they'll like probably have to cram more of us into <anon type="place"/> <pause dur="short"/> because there's</u>
<u n="622" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="623" who="S0120">space <pause dur="short"/> there's some empty rooms there</u>
<u n="624" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Oh right</u>
<u n="625" who="S0120">um <pause dur="short"/> and yeah I'm not sure about the rest</u>
<u n="626" who="S0058">mm</u>
<u n="627" who="S0120">find somewhere temporary</u>
<u n="628" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="629" who="S0120">work from home?</u>
<u n="630" who="S0058">I was just about to say yeah <pause dur="short"/> presumably anyone who can will work from home <pause dur="short"/> save them money</u>
<u n="631" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="632" who="S0058">that'd be good</u>
<u n="633" who="S0120">um <pause dur="short"/> that'll be weird</u>
<u n="634" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="635" who="S0120">and for that long might present some problems</u>
<u n="636" who="S0058">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="637" who="S0120">dunno <pause dur="short"/> organizationally</u>
<u n="638" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it would be um it's er a lot easier not to work at home I think</u>
<u n="639" who="S0120">mm</u>
<u n="640" who="S0058">or you could have er</u>
<u n="641" who="S0120">but er</u>
<u n="642" who="S0058">you could have er sort of um like <trunc>t</trunc> er sort of some days a week you work from home some days you come into the office</u>
<u n="643" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="644" who="S0058">which I think is maybe the easiest way <pause dur="short"/> so you don't need to be like über organized and have all your stuff <pause dur="short"/> cos you can go in and you know occasionally and get stuff and just keep swapping round <pause dur="short"/> but then you only need half the desks</u>
<u n="645" who="S0120">yeah <pause dur="short"/> hm</u>
<u n="646" who="S0058">hm <pause dur="short"/> oh that's exciting</u>
<u n="647" who="S0120">and then it'll probably er take about a year for them to do it</u>
<u n="648" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="649" who="S0120">and we'd have a brand new fancy building <pause dur="short"/> everybody'd fit in one building <pause dur="short"/> we only have to pay one rent</u>
<u n="650" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="651" who="S0120">even though that rent would be then higher because it's higher value</u>
<u n="652" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but and then of course the energy savings and stuff</u>
<u n="653" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="654" who="S0058">if it's er you know all jazzy and shiny and new would</u>
<u n="655" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="656" who="S0058">presumably it's gonna save money in the long run</u>
<u n="657" who="S0120">yeah <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> the MD was saying um people people get the impression we don't spend much on this building <pause dur="short"/> cos you know we haven't fixed the</u>
<u n="658" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="659" who="S0120">fixed the windows</u>
<u n="660" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="661" who="S0120">and that kind of thing <pause dur="short"/> but we actually spent a huge <vocal desc="laugh"/> amount on the <trunc>w</trunc> just to keep the building going</u>
<u n="662" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> once it gets to a certain point they probably presumably just decided yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="663" who="S0120">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and it's it's partly because</u>
<u n="664" who="S0058">stop throwing money away</u>
<u n="665" who="S0120">because this might be on the horizon that they're not prioritizing small <trunc>bi</trunc> smaller repairs</u>
<u n="666" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="667" who="S0120">like replacing carpet tiles</u>
<u n="668" who="S0058"><vocal desc="laugh"/> Yeah</u>
<u n="669" who="S0120">or <unclear/></u>
<u n="670" who="S0058">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's like um <anon type="address"/> um <anon type="address"/></u>
<u n="671" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="672" who="S0058">and twenty-five <pause dur="short"/> they just stopped repairing it <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="673" who="S0120">yeah</u>
<u n="674" who="S0058">it got manky <pause dur="short"/> because they were like well we're not gonna spend a penny on it <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="675" who="S0120">but <anon type="address"/>?</u>
<u n="676" who="S0058">yeah</u>
<u n="677" who="S0120">have you seen it?</u>
<u n="678" who="S0058">I've been in  I've been in  one of them <pause dur="short"/> and it's all guesty and nice</u>
