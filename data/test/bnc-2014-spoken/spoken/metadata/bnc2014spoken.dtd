Document Type Definition for 

   =======================================
   The SPOKEN BRITISH NATIONAL CORPUS 2014 
   =======================================

This DTD draws on several examples and best practices. The two primary sources
are (a) the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and (b) the variation of TEI that
is used by the original 1994 British National Corpus.

However, the practices codified in this DTD differ from those in TEI in a 
number of ways. Most notably, the XML markup of the BNC2014 is dramatically
simplified relative to TEI/BNC1994. This is in line with the recommendations
of Hardie (2014), who argues that a small subset of the features of XML and
TEI are more than sufficient for most corpus linguistic analysis.

Reference:

Hardie, A (2014) Modest XML for Corpora: Not a standard, but a suggestion. 
   ICAME Journal 38: 73-103. http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/icame-2014-0004

For that reason, while much of what follows will be familiar to anyone who has
used TEI, it does not actually use a TEI definition. Nor are any of the
advanced features of XML/DTD used.
