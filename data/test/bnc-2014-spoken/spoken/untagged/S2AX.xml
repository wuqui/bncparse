<u n="107" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I don't know if it's I maybe <trunc>sim</trunc> oversimplified but that was his argument</u>
<u n="108" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well <pause dur="short"/> no I'm just saying</u>
<u n="109" who="S0037">so</u>
<u n="110" who="S0115">if he's talking about the the old classes but I mean working class uh <pause dur="short"/> but well they've had different types of classes but <pause dur="short"/> no there are clearly different  there are clearly different  classes and you know culture cultures and classes I mean <pause dur="short"/> they they it's about social networks isn't it I mean</u>
<u n="111" who="S0037">well</u>
<u n="112" who="S0115">there are clearly <trunc>di</trunc> sets of people that are detached from others like you know they live in</u>
<u n="113" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="114" who="S0115">like if you're in the sort of uh in the urban uh urban sort of inner city then then that's gonna be that's a certain kind of class isn't it and then if you're in sort of a <trunc>de</trunc> a declined uh <trunc>e</trunc> estate thing then that's another sort of like a <trunc>m</trunc> but it's not urban so that's a  that's a  different sort of class and different</u>
<u n="115" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah I mean</u>
<u n="116" who="S0115">but yeah it's it's cultures yeah I mean <pause dur="short"/> but I don't <pause dur="short"/> he he's just he just specializes in selling books doesn't he I mean?</u>
<u n="117" who="S0037">well <pause dur="short"/> I dunno if I like him that much <pause dur="short"/> I think he's a bit smarmy</u>
<u n="118" who="S0115" trans="overlap">like you were saying he said something it's just  it's just  a sensational thing to say <pause dur="short"/> that that if you're saying that we now have the the urban poor but we also have the the more <trunc>de</trunc> decaying uh estate poor</u>
<u n="119" who="S0037">decaying?</u>
<u n="120" who="S0115"><trunc>De</trunc> <trunc>de</trunc> decaying estate like</u>
<u n="121" who="S0037">sorry I was thinking about like their teeth or something</u>
<u n="122" who="S0115">no uh <pause dur="short"/> like if you have the poor from say like an estate in Doncaster or something then if you have the poor from more urban um from from the inner city of London</u>
<u n="123" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="124" who="S0115">or I mean the the the cities the urban city poor have things in common I suppose like</u>
<u n="125" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="126" who="S0115">if you're from the inner city of Birmingham or Nottingham or Leicester or London then you probably have things in common</u>
<u n="127" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>
<u n="128" who="S0115" trans="overlap">but I guess what what he would what he's trying to say is that people with the same amount of money have different cultures and not part of a single class but then I don't know if there ever if it was ever that simple anyway</u>
<u n="129" who="S0037">no I don't think it was I think he's</u>
<u n="130" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> cos he</u>
<u n="131" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I read a really interesting um interview with him where like reviewer was like just picking holes at him like saying Hey but you said this <pause dur="short"/> d'you really think this? And yeah it was just <pause dur="short"/> he'd sort of was quite spiky about it <pause dur="short"/> did I showed it yeah?</u>
<u n="132" who="S0115" trans="overlap">oh um I think you might have uh might have showed me <pause dur="short"/> I think it was the or was it the Guardian uh complaining about his class thing?</u>
<u n="133" who="S0037">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it was quite funny</u>
<u n="134" who="S0115">clearly there are rich people there's an elite <pause dur="short"/> there's there's obviously in Britain in in Britain we've got <pause dur="short"/> I dunno who that is</u>
<u n="135" who="S0037" trans="overlap">alright Trenton <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> You do it's the swimming boat race swimming guy</u>

<u n="137" who="S0037">trenton<vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="138" who="S0115">so he I mean now now we can't <pause dur="short"/> no offence to him you know it's like can't even you can't even mention the elite any more people will just accuse you of like spoiling a boat race or whatever <pause dur="short"/> I mean what's the point?</u>
<u n="139" who="S0037" trans="overlap">doesn't matter I was only teasing</u>
<u n="140" who="S0115">uh <pause dur="short"/> there's um there's a global elite <pause dur="short"/> there's there's aristocracy in in different countries <pause dur="short"/> um and I guess they they sort of blow into the global elite <pause dur="short"/> then there's you know then there's wealthy people</u>
<u n="141" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="142" who="S0115">then there's  then there's  sort of medium <pause dur="short"/> and then there's you know then and then there are the poor aren't there and then there are the  there are the  tramps</u>
<u n="143" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I don't suppose I'm that interested in</u>
<u n="144" who="S0115">and you know it's not that easy to get from one you know from a tramp to the global super rich <pause dur="short"/> um because of the disconnectivity you know like</u>
<u n="145" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well I know people are born into different</u>
<u n="146" who="S0115">because you you <trunc>m</trunc> you don't have that many great influences in your social network or whatever</u>
<u n="147" who="S0037">no I know I know <pause dur="short"/> people are born into different things</u>
<u n="148" who="S0115">and you don't have the money uh at your disposal you know to to just  to just  afford to make mistakes you know</u>
<u n="149" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="150" who="S0115">if you're rich you you make a few mistakes and you get a maybe you get a</u>

<u n="158" who="S0115">if you haven't got money obviously then you know I mean everybody uh has a life in which to make something of it but if you're in a different class that's gonna make it a lot harder or easier depending on what class you're in</u>
<u n="159" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah it is but I think you should <pause dur="short"/> you've gotta do your own thing though haven't you you've gotta do what you think's the right thing <pause dur="short"/> and I think you can't make too much of it either way like <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>th</trunc> I think that everyone should have the same opportunities <pause dur="short"/> and I don't think you should be proud or ashamed of what your you know what your situation is whether you <pause dur="short"/> what your  what your  race is whether you're a woman or a man whether you live from this <trunc>pl</trunc> whether you're in this place whether you were born here or there or everywhere like it doesn't matter <pause dur="short"/> I think everyone should have the same</u>

A lot of people have complained about elitism it it's frequently complained about from from a lot of different <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>t</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> I <trunc>t</trunc> one person who complained about it was Rupert Murdoch</u>

<u n="222" who="S0115">rhetoric from him <pause dur="short"/> he was born into a very <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>s</trunc> wealthy background but you know and he inherited a newspaper <pause dur="short"/> but he he <trunc>w</trunc> he would often talk about the the elitism of uh British of British Establishment cos he went to Oxford</u>

<u n="224" who="S0115">and also of uh of um of the BBC as well he he's always hated the BBC</u>

<u n="232" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> uh well uh obviously it's about whether or not there is elitism <pause dur="short"/> I mean presumably we're talking about in Britain</u>
<u n="233" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="234" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> bearing in mind what what Murdoch's done I guess he's proved that he's actually become the elite himself so</u>
<u n="235" who="S0037">mhm</u>
<u n="236" who="S0115">uh <pause dur="short"/> uh is it  is it  one of those things the ironic thing of you know you you topple the bully but in so doing you you have to be come you have to become the bully <pause dur="short"/> uh but Animal Farm is another thing about that uh</u>
<u n="237" who="S0037" trans="overlap">you have to be a bully yourself yeah <pause dur="short"/> but I read a interesting thing about um about the you know the boat race thing? And like someone was saying you know alright he was trying to topple elitism but like actually those people who row in the  who row in the  boat race aren't like necessarily these elite like not all rowers are from public schools any more I mean there was only like two well there was only one in the Cambridge boat <pause dur="short"/> british guy and there was only a couple in the Oxford boat <pause dur="short"/> they're just like they're international athletes they're not really  they're not really  like</u>
<u n="238" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="239" who="S0037">public schoolboy rowers are they I mean? I mean I know it wasn't a target it wasn't targeted at those rowers it was targeted at Oxford and Cambridge but um <pause dur="short"/> not everyone who goes to Oxford and Cambridge are posh are they? Just most of them I suppose <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="240" who="S0115" trans="overlap">uh no no well it was said that uh that they only used to take from um from uh private schools but they've expanded now anyway I mean I'm sure they take a substantial percentage of uh</u>
<u n="241" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="242" who="S0115">but it was pointed out uh I think it was John Prescott mentioned some some percentage about you know the the private schools produces a a very high percentage of uh</u>
<u n="243" who="S0037" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="244" who="S0115">you know so it's more about <trunc>pr</trunc> it's more about the school than the university <pause dur="short"/> by the time you're at university you know you you've you've been you've sort of grown up and you've had your upbringing but uh</u>
<u n="245" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="246" who="S0115">but at um <pause dur="short"/> yeah so private the private schools <trunc>produ</trunc> produce the the the great majority of of top uh British jobs <pause dur="short"/> uh and that was um you know that could be interpreted by some people to be</u>
<u n="247" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="248" who="S0115">uh elitism because before you've gone to private school you may well not have shown that level of uh skill</u>
<u n="249" who="S0037" trans="overlap">but I think the problem is in the <trunc>sch</trunc> in the school system though isn't it like why people wanna send their kids to private school why the normal schools aren't good enough <pause dur="short"/> or do you think that that people would always just send them to private school even if the schools were really good?</u>
<u n="250" who="S0115">uh some people do <trunc>u</trunc> would use a state school if it's a good one yeah</u>
<u n="251" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="252" who="S0115">um <pause dur="short"/> the the problem is uh there's a fear of um the children mixing <trunc>w</trunc> mixing with the wrong ones so they they wouldn't wanna send them</u>
<u n="253" who="S0037" trans="overlap">being ruffians? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="256" who="S0115" trans="overlap">if you're from a  if you're from a  successful family</u>
<u n="257" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="258" who="S0115">then uh you you you want your child children to be um successful so um that that would mean you'd wanna go to a successful school where the majority of them you have to pay full but but um <pause dur="short"/> but but not all I mean <pause dur="short"/> that's I think that is one of the big uh issues but <trunc>u</trunc> yeah cos on the debate they didn't really get</u>
<u n="259" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="260" who="S0115">I don't think they really discussed the sort of like the the hardest the the sort of strongest arguments about it like <pause dur="short"/> I think the main  the main  point is if private schools <trunc>giv</trunc> given that private schools <trunc>c</trunc> provide the most top jobs in the UK uh it's a shame that that you'd have to pay to get that quality because that excludes people who don't have access to that money from getting into that thing</u>
<u n="261" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I dunno if you're really excluded from anything if you were the sort of person that wants to do that I think you you you'll always find a way though</u>
<u n="262" who="S0115" trans="overlap">so they the the the answers are uh uh <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah but as a child <pause dur="short"/> you mean  you mean  to get into public</u>
<u n="263" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I dunno I just think <pause dur="short"/> I think part of it's in</u>
<u n="264" who="S0115" trans="overlap">no but the <trunc>pr</trunc> problem is that the public schools are <trunc>g</trunc> producing that high percentage and and therefore you could help it by getting more uh talented children from in freely into public schools</u>
<u n="265" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="266" who="S0115">using scholarships</u>
<u n="267" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah yeah</u>

<u n="270" who="S0115">but if you're saying that that doesn't matter uh we'll we'll we'll just forget we'll forget the school bit we'll just go from the age sixteen or age eighteen entry point and then  and then  say so we could improve all the schools as well yeah</u>
<u n="271" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I dunno because I just think like <pause dur="short"/> I dunno <pause dur="short"/> I just <pause dur="short"/> no I I I suppose that's not what I'm saying <pause dur="short"/> what I'm saying is like I think that sometimes it's just in you <pause dur="short"/> like if if you're the sort of person who wants to do something then you'll do it like <pause dur="short"/> I don't know how much the school counts <pause dur="short"/> surely not everyone who goes to a public school comes out with a good job <pause dur="short"/> surely not everyone who goes to a public school ends up doing something good <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure loads of them end up doing normal things like <pause dur="short"/> I'm sure there's loads of people who went to private school who are just doing jobs that that <trunc>th</trunc> like anyone's doing you know?

<u n="428" who="S0115" trans="overlap">that's a legend isn't it? Yeah</u>
<u n="429" who="S0037">but um wouldn't it be good like if you could like if <trunc>s</trunc> go back to your great great great grandfathers and like then like amass all your relatives like there'd be so many people that you didn't know?</u>
<u n="430" who="S0115">yeah well we we were I mean we were looking at uh at our uh like bit of our <trunc>hi</trunc> family backgrounds um</u>
<u n="431" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="432" who="S0115">we realized that uh that that if you the further back in time you</u>
<u n="433" who="S0037" trans="overlap">it's totally different now isn't it like? Everything can be recorded</u>
<u n="434" who="S0115">that it at a certain point you know <trunc>e</trunc> each generation the the number of relatives would increase</u>
<u n="435" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="436" who="S0115">um by a certain amount and then there would be an exponential increase I suppose so um it as you go back <pause dur="short"/> the further back in time you go the the more relatives you you'd have</u>
<u n="437" who="S0037" trans="overlap">you'd have now yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's true</u>
<u n="438" who="S0115" trans="overlap">uh <pause dur="short"/> the higher proportion of the globe would be related to you I think</u>

<u n="441" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no that's right like <pause dur="short"/> the further back the more people are related</u>
<u n="442" who="S0115">yeah I <trunc>th</trunc> I thought that made sense although <pause dur="short"/> but that's actually sounds that sounds like that sounds contradictory because</u>
<u n="443" who="S0037">how?</u>
<u n="444" who="S0115">Cos if if they're <trunc>rela</trunc> <pause dur="short"/> if they're related back then they'd they'd also be related forward as well like it depends how direct you're talking about</u>
<u n="445" who="S0037" trans="overlap">there are more people now <pause dur="short"/> what d'you mean?</u>
<u n="446" who="S0115">like like um</u>
<u n="447" who="S0037">well we are all related aren't we I mean? Of course</u>
<u n="448" who="S0115">no yeah I meant  I meant  like direct ancestors so like</u>
<u n="449" who="S0037">you mean like grandparents grandparents grandparents grandparents or?</u>
<u n="450" who="S0115" trans="overlap">um <pause dur="short"/> if you keep going on back in time yeah you you get to a point where like masses of the proportion of the population at at that point would be your ancestors so</u>
<u n="451" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="452" who="S0115">your direct ancestors because of course uh it's basic I mean like obviously I've got two ancestors from the previous generation <pause dur="short"/> four from the one above that</u>
<u n="453" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="454" who="S0115">so it's going up exponentially and sort of</u>
<u n="455" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="456" who="S0115">um <trunc>t</trunc> <trunc>t</trunc> two to the  two to the  power of <pause dur="short"/> two to the power of N isn't it so? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="459" who="S0037">yeah</u>
<u n="460" who="S0115">alive <pause dur="short"/> and they have to all be different of course they can't be like <pause dur="short"/> I suppose in certain situations maybe there might've been a bit of crossing over but</u>
<u n="461" who="S0037" trans="overlap">you don't know <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="462" who="S0115">uh so you go back no I think it's it's four generations in a hundred years <pause dur="short"/> you go back ten thousand years <pause dur="short"/> you've got <trunc>ten</trunc></u>

<u n="464" who="S0115" trans="overlap">well I thought <pause dur="short"/> well say say four <trunc>h</trunc> four generations four hundred years <pause dur="short"/> then that's uh obviously four four thousand would be forty generations</u>

<u n="470" who="S0115">Don't wait four uh four in a hundred years <pause dur="short"/> forty then</u>

<u n="473" who="S0037" trans="overlap">I dunno I've lost the <pause dur="short"/> I've the thread</u>
<u n="474" who="S0115">so yeah four hundred two to the power of four hundred out of the population would've been your uh ancestors</u>

<u n="479" who="S0037">well</u>
<u n="480" who="S0115">so it means like <pause dur="short"/> you know what I mean like? I dunno what two to the four hundred is but I  but I  guess it's like it's over like it's over six billion</u>

<u n="759" who="S0115">we've got  we've got  enough uh <pause dur="short"/> I mean you've gotta have bacon anyway but yeah <pause dur="short"/> oh you mean you wanna <trunc>m</trunc> you wanna make it more special but less you said like less <pause dur="short"/> cos you had cos of all the fact you had like five vegetables or something</u>
<u n="760" who="S0037">there was more than five vegetables</u>
<u n="761" who="S0115">that's a lot of <pause dur="short"/> more than five a day <pause dur="short"/> well I think it went really well <pause dur="short"/> I think the fact there was a lot of vegetables was actually a really good aspect of it but yeah yeah you well you can take each vegetable and do like a little little party with each vegetable like <pause dur="short"/> could make like a  like a  soup yeah</u>
<u n="762" who="S0037" trans="overlap">yeah exactly that's what I thought <pause dur="short"/> I though like maybe <pause dur="short"/> I don't mean like have less necessarily I just mean like put more into like</u>
<u n="763" who="S0115" trans="overlap">cauliflower <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> broccoli and <pause dur="short"/> I think broccoli's pretty good on its own actually <pause dur="short"/> with salted broccoli's pretty good</u>
<u n="764" who="S0037" trans="overlap">well broccoli's pretty good on its own but like maybe I don't know sort of thinking more about like <pause dur="short"/> like roasting some different things like butternut squash is really nice roasted</u>
<u n="765" who="S0115" trans="overlap">yeah also you have your <trunc>ba</trunc> your sprouts and <pause dur="short"/> roast parsnips <pause dur="short"/> parsnip</u>

<u n="770" who="S0037" trans="overlap">no what I said was I said that the um I didn't <trunc>th</trunc> I ran out of time with the potatoes like all the rest of the dinner was cooked and my potatoes could've done with an extra fifteen minutes but I didn't wanna like hold up the dinner <pause dur="short"/> it's about timing isn't it like making a giant Christmas dinner <pause dur="short"/> with like all them vegetables? It's not about good cooking really <pause dur="short"/> it's about  it's about  timing</u>
<u n="771" who="S0115" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah the timing yeah I mean or the ability to keep things um to get things ready yeah uh</u>
<u n="772" who="S0037">and I think like do more different stuff like make <trunc>di</trunc> <trunc>t</trunc> different stuffings like <pause dur="short"/> like not just I mean like last year I made like a a sausage meat stuffing <pause dur="short"/> all very nice but like why don't we make something? You know what I mean?</u>
<u n="773" who="S0115">yeah</u>
<u n="774" who="S0037">just do like more different things <pause dur="short"/> although your mam will just want a hundred million thousand vegetables to pour pour all on her plate a big mountain with like a massive turkey on the top but <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I think if I was <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I just think uh I think it would be good to do different things <pause dur="short"/> like I dunno what about like <pause dur="short"/> okay I don't like asparagus but</u>
