<u n="7" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> What did she say? She'd er sold it on eBay?</u>
<u n="8" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but that only worked because I didn't have the answer machine message on the phone</u>
<u n="9" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0024">otherwise it would have just rang three times like <trunc>be</trunc> because I kept ringing it and ringing it and ringing it somebody had to pick it up eventually because like they couldn't stop it from ringing</u>
<u n="11" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0024">that's the only reason it got picked up because otherwise it would have just kept going on to answer machine and they would never have found it underneath the seat or whatever they found it</u>
<u n="13" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> who found it?</u>
<u n="14" who="S0024">they must have found it on the back of the bus and run it up to the bus driver cos she was still driving</u>
<u n="15" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="16" who="S0024">well she wasn't still driving she was paused at a roundabout or something <pause dur="short"/> she shouldn't have picked it up really</u>
<u n="17" who="S0144">well it was nice they gave it then cos</u>
<u n="18" who="S0024">I don't understand how I dropped it in the first place</u>

<u n="25" who="S0144">mm mm</u>
<u n="26" who="S0024">around the <anon type="place"/> bit <pause dur="short"/> I got really confused actually cos when when I walked up there I thought I could cut through the <anon type="place"/> and walk round the back way but of course that's the way I used to go when I went to school there</u>
<u n="27" who="S0144" trans="overlap">right</u>
<u n="28" who="S0024">and you go through the <anon type="place"/> school and go round the back of the sixth form and end up in the fields where we used to do cross country</u>
<u n="29" who="S0144">right</u>
<u n="30" who="S0024">but of course that's the way I went when I went to school <pause dur="short"/> so I walked up there and I was like I can't get through that footpath anymore because you have to <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>bas</trunc> I think it is a public footpath but you have to walk through the school to get to the back <pause dur="short"/> so I walked all the way back again and around and eventually caught up with them <pause dur="short"/> and Lucky had run <pause dur="short"/> Lucky ran away again <pause dur="short"/> she hadn't taken him off the lead since last time</u>
<u n="31" who="S0144" trans="overlap">did he? Is he not very er? He's not very trained</u>

<u n="33" who="S0144" trans="overlap">he comes back with a pheasant doesn't he?</u>
<u n="34" who="S0024">well no he started chasing rabbits because we went past this field and there was there was just rabbits running about everywhere and then he started running miles away <pause dur="short"/> miles away <pause dur="short"/> and there's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> running back and forth <pause dur="short"/> Lucky <pause dur="short"/> Lucky</u>
<u n="35" who="S0144">oh no</u>

<u n="37" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="38" who="S0024">I don't know why</u>
<u n="39" who="S0144">well</u>
<u n="40" who="S0024" trans="overlap">but last time they went for a walk they went for a walk and she ended up phoning erm <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s mum</u>
<u n="41" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0024">to come and help her get him because he'd literally gone in these woods</u>
<u n="43" who="S0144">what he just legs it does he?</u>
<u n="44" who="S0024">and it wouldn't come wouldn't come back <pause dur="short"/> couldn't get back</u>
<u n="45" who="S0144" trans="overlap">our dog used to do that <pause dur="short"/> he used to be he used to be a nightmare <pause dur="short"/> he used to erm like if a cyclist went past that was it <pause dur="short"/> he was off</u>
<u n="46" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="47" who="S0144">and he would he would like jump at the bike and</u>
<u n="48" who="S0024">oh that's not nice <pause dur="short"/> that's not nice at all</u>
<u n="49" who="S0144">it was horrible <pause dur="short"/> it was embarrassing taking the dog for the walk <pause dur="short"/> and he used to god he used like just crap everywhere <pause dur="short"/> like you'd take him for a walk around the block and he'd take a big dump outside someone's like driveway</u>
<u n="50" who="S0024">and then you have to just walk about with your plastic bags</u>
<u n="51" who="S0144">well this is in the nineties <pause dur="short"/> no-one did that</u>
<u n="52" who="S0024">oh that's horrible</u>
<u n="53" who="S0144">so I just had to kind of leave it</u>
<u n="54" who="S0024">no <unclear/></u>
<u n="55" who="S0144" trans="overlap">and if someone was <pause dur="short"/> well I had nothing on me you know</u>
<u n="56" who="S0024">oh no</u>
<u n="57" who="S0144">and if someone saw you the looks she gave <pause dur="short"/> quite rightly so as well</u>
<u n="58" who="S0024">quite rightly you don't want that on your door step</u>
<u n="59" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but it was I used to hate taking that dog for a walk <pause dur="short"/> I used to hate it <pause dur="short"/> he was just so out of control <pause dur="short"/> but you can I mean how old is Lucky?</u>
<u n="60" who="S0024">he's only young <pause dur="short"/> he's young</u>
<u n="61" who="S0144">I mean you <trunc>sh</trunc> you should be able to train him</u>
<u n="62" who="S0024">she was talking today about putting him towards some more training</u>
<u n="63" who="S0144" trans="overlap">but but because they found him though was a stray dog wasn't he?</u>
<u n="64" who="S0024">yeah but he was a puppy <pause dur="short"/> he was very little</u>
<u n="65" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah but no they're the dogs we got as well but because they'd had a a bad upbringing <vocal desc="laugh"/> they were difficult to train</u>
<u n="66" who="S0024" trans="overlap">but it was he was little <pause dur="short"/> he'd been abandoned</u>
<u n="67" who="S0144">yeah exactly <pause dur="short"/> I mean these these dogs are a bit messed up psychologically I think</u>
<u n="68" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="69" who="S0144">they're not <pause dur="short"/> you know if if they'd been brought up in a stable upbringing</u>
<u n="70" who="S0024">you'd have thought if they had been abandoned though they'd want to cling to their new owners quite well and not leave them</u>
<u n="71" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> they are more difficult to train</u>
<u n="72" who="S0024">it's his breed as well <pause dur="short"/> I mean he's a he chases everything</u>
<u n="73" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="74" who="S0024">I mean he's a hunting dog really</u>
<u n="75" who="S0144">hmm</u>
<u n="76" who="S0024">but hunting dogs get trained so that should be should be possible I don't know</u>
<u n="77" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah yeah you need to know what you're doing don't you</u>
<u n="78" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I think they should take him to a school</u>
<u n="79" who="S0144">we tried that with our dog and he was just useless man <pause dur="short"/> he was just useless</u>
<u n="80" who="S0024" trans="overlap">some dogs you just can't can you</u>
<u n="81" who="S0144">but also like our house because I don't know it was a bit of mess really <pause dur="short"/> I can understand why he didn't learn anything</u>
<u n="82" who="S0024">hmm</u>
<u n="83" who="S0144">because it was a bit of a dysfunctional kind of environment for him</u>
<u n="84" who="S0024">the thing is with with both both of <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s dogs <pause dur="short"/> they've kind of <pause dur="short"/> they've been a bit soft on them</u>
<u n="85" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="86" who="S0024">so er when <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> moved over from <anon type="place"/> she felt quite sorry for Lucky and losing the cat and everything <pause dur="short"/> losing his like little companion that he had all of his life <pause dur="short"/> she they started letting him sleep on the bed <pause dur="short"/> at the bottom of the bed <pause dur="short"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> did the same when when erm her other dog died she started letting Larry sleep on the bed <pause dur="short"/> and now both of them have got this massive problem of trying to get the dog off the bed</u>
<u n="87" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="88" who="S0024">like every night <pause dur="short"/> I mean can you imagine every night the dog comes and sleeps at the bottom of on your bed</u>
<u n="89" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah I've had the same thing <pause dur="short"/> not on the beds but on the on the sofas</u>
<u n="90" who="S0024">I just think no no <pause dur="short"/> yeah but on the sofas that's different <pause dur="short"/> that's not in your bed</u>
<u n="91" who="S0144">yeah he did used to come up on the bed though <pause dur="short"/> but only when we were out the house and then you'd get back and he'd be like running down the stairs looking really sheepish</u>
<u n="92" who="S0024" trans="overlap">well there you go <pause dur="short"/> he knows that he's done wrong whereas they've kind of let him</u>
<u n="93" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah and he'd have his tail between his legs</u>
<u n="94" who="S0024">and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> says you know when they change house and stuff when when everything's a bit more settled for him they'll change it but I I don't think you can</u>
<u n="95" who="S0144" trans="overlap">no  you can't  you can't teach an old dog new tricks</u>
<u n="96" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0144">you can't you have to  you have to  really put it in them when they're young</u>
<u n="98" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I think they've yeah they've made a bit of a mistake there</u>
<u n="99" who="S0144" trans="overlap">he's a nice dog though <pause dur="short"/> he is a nice dog</u>
<u n="100" who="S0024">yeah but can you imagine every night having the dog on the bottom of your bed?</u>
<u n="101" who="S0144">no I wouldn't want that <pause dur="short"/> cos it stinks as well and you get the hairs</u>
<u n="102" who="S0024" trans="overlap">and then <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> goes out and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> fancies a little cuddle with the dog <pause dur="short"/> and like you know has a little cuddle <pause dur="short"/> oh come here Lucky <pause dur="short"/> in the bed <pause dur="short"/> no I don't like that idea at all <pause dur="short"/> it's horrible</u>
<u n="103" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="104" who="S0024">it's bad habits like what are they going to do when they've got kids? They'll have the kids in the bed and the dog in the bed and urgh <pause dur="short"/> no it's not nice</u>
<u n="105" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> well they're thinking about living in a caravan so</u>
<u n="106" who="S0024">oh they were talking more about caravans today</u>
<u n="107" who="S0144">were they?</u>
<u n="108" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> trying I I don't know if she knows all the laws because she was talking about the static static houses</u>
<u n="109" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="110" who="S0024">but I was saying now I think I think they changed the law so you've got to have planning permission for a static house now as well</u>
<u n="111" who="S0144">really?</u>
<u n="112" who="S0024">think so <pause dur="short"/> I think so</u>
<u n="113" who="S0144">you need planning <pause dur="short"/> hang on <pause dur="short"/> you need planning <trunc>per</trunc> permission for a static house?</u>
<u n="114" who="S0024">yeah I think so <pause dur="short"/> it's not how it used to be</u>
<u n="115" who="S0144">it depends on the dimensions <pause dur="short"/> depends how big it is</u>
<u n="116" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="117" who="S0144">when a shed becomes a house <pause dur="short"/> because you can have sheds with plumbing and electric</u>
<u n="118" who="S0024">well that's the <trunc>th</trunc> well</u>
<u n="119" who="S0144" trans="overlap">but you you've got these little sites though with the erm with the temporary homes on them</u>
<u n="120" who="S0024">yeah but I think those temporary homes <pause dur="short"/> I'm pretty sure now you have to have some sort of permission to go them <pause dur="short"/> you can't just put them up anywhere</u>
<u n="121" who="S0144" trans="overlap">do they have <pause dur="short"/> but you can <pause dur="short"/> but they're not built though are they? <trunc>Y</trunc> you can drag them around</u>
<u n="122" who="S0024" trans="overlap">no they're not attached <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> but you still <pause dur="short"/> I think you still need permission nowadays</u>
<u n="123" who="S0144">do you?</u>
<u n="124" who="S0024">oh I don't know but she's got all these romantic ideas about what to do and I don't</u>
<u n="125" who="S0144" trans="overlap">no she's got a great well they've they've both got great ideas <pause dur="short"/> they want to do the right thing</u>
<u n="126" who="S0024" trans="overlap">they are good ideas <pause dur="short"/> I'd love to do what they want to do but they're romantic ideas they're not practical to go</u>
<u n="127" who="S0144" trans="overlap">they are yeah <pause dur="short"/> well they they've got no kind of back up <pause dur="short"/> that's the problem <unclear/></u>
<u n="128" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I mean <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> thinks it's well funny <unclear/> cos there's these campsites that they want to go on and there's there's different kinds of camp <pause dur="short"/> different not campsites <pause dur="short"/> caravanish sites or trailer sites or something like that <pause dur="short"/> and like some of them you have to be over fifty-five and no pets to go on them <pause dur="short"/> like there's certain types</u>
<u n="129" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> right so they don't tick either of those boxes</u>
<u n="130" who="S0024" trans="overlap">well that's those types or the other type of site isn't the type of site they really want to go on because they're a bit rough <pause dur="short"/> they need like a <trunc>me</trunc> a middle one</u>
<u n="131" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well yeah they <pause dur="short"/> well maybe there's a market for that then <pause dur="short"/> because you've got your your old age pensioner sites and you've got your gyppo sites <pause dur="short"/> maybe there will <pause dur="short"/> I think they will <pause dur="short"/> that's a good idea actually</u>
<u n="132" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="133" who="S0144">especially at the moment <pause dur="short"/> there there's definitely going to be you know no one can buy a house</u>
<u n="134" who="S0024" trans="overlap">cheap accommodation sites <pause dur="short"/> hmm</u>
<u n="135" who="S0144">people who want to buy just a temporary residence or a</u>
<u n="136" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah but like in a nice</u>
<u n="137" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="138" who="S0024">but how how would you</u>
<u n="139" who="S0144">well you'd have to buy</u>
<u n="140" who="S0024">how would you test people on saying that whether they're nice enough or not? You can't can you? How do you test people in saying they're nice enough?</u>
<u n="141" who="S0144">no but you just need to market it a way that suggests that <pause dur="short"/> that's a really good idea actually</u>
<u n="142" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> it's not bad</u>
<u n="143" who="S0144">if you buy a bit of land and try and target the people that you'd like to live on it</u>
<u n="144" who="S0024">but I think you probably have to have planning permission</u>
<u n="145" who="S0144">what to turn it into a site? Yeah you would</u>
<u n="146" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0144">hmm <pause dur="short"/> I think</u>
<u n="148" who="S0024" trans="overlap">but yeah you target people like them and like us who who yeah can't afford a house or don't want to go into the mortgage just yet and just want to live together in a community but not in a commune <pause dur="short"/> kind of thing <pause dur="short"/> a community not a commune</u>
<u n="149" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I think that's the way forward though <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> no <pause dur="short"/> well  I think  I think a lot of people are getting turned off with mortgages as well and quite rightly I think</u>
<u n="150" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="151" who="S0144">I don't think <pause dur="short"/> again like what we were saying earlier you get this this way of conditioning where you think that's that's the only route to take</u>
<u n="152" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="153" who="S0144">like in France they don't buy their houses they they only erm they they only rent them</u>
<u n="154" who="S0024">what?</u>
<u n="155" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's</u>
<u n="156" who="S0024" trans="overlap">well some people must buy them</u>
<u n="157" who="S0144">but a lot of countries they don't actually buy their houses like they do in this country <pause dur="short"/> and you don't even now like you don't buy the house <pause dur="short"/> you've got your mortgage and you're just paying a long term rent aren't you?</u>
<u n="158" who="S0024">well what do they do in France? Just rent?</u>
<u n="159" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think so</u>
<u n="160" who="S0024">well who owns the land?</u>
<u n="161" who="S0144">I don't know but who who does own the land anyway?</u>
<u n="162" who="S0024">that's what <pause dur="short"/> yeah cos Rob was saying the other day that that scheme <pause dur="short"/> remember that scheme that scheme he was talking about? How they they wanted to sub-let land and they would help you buy land <pause dur="short"/> it was really confusing</u>
<u n="163" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="164" who="S0024">and I was saying Rob ultimately the queen owns all of the land and he was saying  he was saying  once this scheme is into place ultimately that company this new company would own the land</u>
<u n="165" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0024">and I was thinking what was the point of that? I don't</u>
<u n="167" who="S0144" trans="overlap">hmm <pause dur="short"/> you have to be careful because</u>
<u n="168" who="S0024">he he's got really caught up in all of that because it's a new age idea or something</u>
<u n="169" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="170" who="S0024">and it's trying to get away from the big companies and the big <pause dur="short"/> but <trunc>ul</trunc> that's going to become big company just owning all of the land</u>
<u n="171" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="172" who="S0024">so you can't get around stuff like that because even if it starts off having good intentions as soon as the money comes in people turn companies turn <pause dur="short"/> everything turns</u>
<u n="173" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="174" who="S0024">they get their big zombie eyes and start looking at those numbers going up in the bank and</u>
<u n="175" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="176" who="S0024">and start thinking oh we own all this land now</u>
<u n="177" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="178" who="S0024">and like might have starts it might start with good intentions but I don't believe that <pause dur="short"/> it's sad <pause dur="short"/> am I a realist? I'm a realist</u>
<u n="179" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah but is it not worth getting in on something that's starting with good intentions and then moving on later?</u>
<u n="180" who="S0024">well no I'd rather have my own land thanks <pause dur="short"/> I don't really want</u>
<u n="181" who="S0144">yeah but how do you have your own land? Like really</u>
<u n="182" who="S0024">you buy it</u>
<u n="183" who="S0144">what either you buy it like outright</u>
<u n="184" who="S0024">see also they think right <pause dur="short"/> they think you can dig dig a massive well <pause dur="short"/> get somebody to come around and dig a massive well and live off your water <pause dur="short"/> and I was saying no you can't because the water board still owns any water that runs under the ground</u>
<u n="185" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> no you can't do that <pause dur="short"/> well they say they will <pause dur="short"/> if if they know you've dug a well they will put a claim to it</u>
<u n="186" who="S0024" trans="overlap">exactly and they say they say you just keep it on the quiet <pause dur="short"/> no no no if you're not buying water from the water board and you've got a house they're going to</u>
<u n="187" who="S0144">well that's very well</u>
<u n="188" who="S0024">very well <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="189" who="S0144">saying that <vocal desc="laugh"/> No it's very well saying that but as soon as you if you get some sort of community developed the water board would be right on your back</u>
<u n="190" who="S0024" trans="overlap">no it won't work <pause dur="short"/> yeah the water board <pause dur="short"/> even if you've only got one house the water board will be why why aren't you buying water from us? There's no well in your area and then they'll just come around and they'll see that you've dug a well and then they'll say and then they'll charge you money</u>
<u n="191" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well they probably wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> yeah that's true yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm mm</u>
<u n="192" who="S0024">well I don't know that's according to my</u>
<u n="193" who="S0144">well</u>
<u n="194" who="S0024">well <pause dur="short"/> that's according my dad <pause dur="short"/> I do tend to trust what my dad says about those kind of things but you don't them for sure</u>
<u n="195" who="S0144">well no but but they looked into all that when they built their house so I mean they do know quite a lot about that kind of thing</u>
<u n="196" who="S0024" trans="overlap">hmm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="197" who="S0144">even though that was what twenty thirty years ago</u>
<u n="198" who="S0024">twenty</u>
<u n="199" who="S0144">twenty years ago <pause dur="short"/> so you know it would have changed since then but you have to be very careful</u>
<u n="200" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="201" who="S0144">but I think it it is a brilliant thing to do and I've got a respect for them doing that <pause dur="short"/> cos that is the way forward to get away from all this</u>
<u n="202" who="S0024" trans="overlap">hmm</u>
<u n="203" who="S0144">I mean god that Homes <trunc>un</trunc> Under the Hammer programme that does my head in <pause dur="short"/> like every person</u>
<u n="204" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I quite like <pause dur="short"/> I like it sometimes</u>
<u n="205" who="S0144">every person on there <pause dur="short"/> oh yeah this is going to add to my portfolio of twenty houses <pause dur="short"/> you know?</u>
<u n="206" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="207" who="S0144">that just <pause dur="short"/> every time I hear that it just kicks me in the balls</u>
<u n="208" who="S0024">yeah it's not nice is it? It's just like them buying more and more and more <pause dur="short"/> I think there should be a limit</u>
<u n="209" who="S0144" trans="overlap">like there's just this huge divide being driven this huge wedge being driven in this country between land owners and those who do not own land</u>
<u n="210" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="211" who="S0144">and that it's all very well if you if you've got some kind of property fine you're laughing <pause dur="short"/> and if you've paid for the mortgage you've paid it off</u>
<u n="212" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="213" who="S0144">but if you haven't like us you're screwed</u>
<u n="214" who="S0024">yeah that does get me as well <pause dur="short"/> I think they should have a limit on the number of properties one <pause dur="short"/> I don't know they should have some sort of limit on how many properties you can buy and rent out</u>
<u n="215" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> or there should be some sort of incentive incentives scheme for first time buyers</u>
<u n="216" who="S0024">Cos <pause dur="short"/> yeah well it's just</u>
<u n="217" who="S0144">even though that would be abused because people who earn loads of property would just put the other <trunc>p</trunc> their sons or daughters as the first time buyer you know so it's really complex <pause dur="short"/> it's a really difficult thing to get sorted but</u>
<u n="218" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah yeah they do that <pause dur="short"/> but they can't do like they can't say you're only allowed to buy three properties or something because then they just class it as a business and then if it's a business then it all turns out differently <pause dur="short"/> and that's your business is to have lots of house</u>
<u n="219" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="220" who="S0024">but I don't think people should be allowed that business to be honest <pause dur="short"/> I think three houses <pause dur="short"/> you can rent out two if necessary <pause dur="short"/> but no more <pause dur="short"/> no more than that</u>
<u n="221" who="S0144" trans="overlap">it is really <pause dur="short"/> it's difficult <pause dur="short"/> yeah but if it's a business that's their business</u>
<u n="222" who="S0024">yeah but that should be enough business <pause dur="short"/> that's enough business you don't need any more money coming in than two houses' worth</u>
<u n="223" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah but once you start saying that kind of thing though then you're kind of limiting progress aren't you <pause dur="short"/> or you've</u>
<u n="224" who="S0024" trans="overlap">no I think there should be a limit <pause dur="short"/> what kind of progress? Just progress on people buying houses</u>
<u n="225" who="S0144">in that sense but you have to apply that across the board <pause dur="short"/> I mean once you say okay that's enough you've done enough there you have to stop <pause dur="short"/> I mean that kind of stunts growth doesn't it?</u>
<u n="226" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> no I don't think it does</u>
<u n="227" who="S0144">it's <trunc>re</trunc> I I don't know what the solution is with that but I'm definitely not going to be buying a house</u>
<u n="228" who="S0024">I'd like to buy some land <pause dur="short"/> I really would</u>
<u n="229" who="S0144">I'd love to <pause dur="short"/> I'd love to but I won't be in the foreseeable future</u>
<u n="230" who="S0024">that's cos you don't want the mortgage at all</u>
<u n="231" who="S0144">yeah no I'd have to buy it outright</u>
<u n="232" who="S0024">yeah but you can't <pause dur="short"/> it's not possible</u>
<u n="233" who="S0144">well anything's possible</u>
<u n="234" who="S0024">it's not possible</u>
<u n="235" who="S0144">yeah it is <pause dur="short"/> I think I think the house market is going to crash further <pause dur="short"/> I don't I mean this revival in the housing market <pause dur="short"/> I don't  I don't  believe it because it if you look at the interest like say from the eighties <pause dur="short"/> what I was doing on the computer the other day</u>
<u n="236" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="237" who="S0144">how much a house cost now to how much it did cost <pause dur="short"/> and then</u>
<u n="238" who="S0024">what were you doing on the computer?</u>
<u n="239" who="S0144">I don't know I I I got the housing prices over like twenty years and then I looked at the interest rates and the inflation and put that into the house prices and they're still way way way over priced</u>
<u n="240" who="S0024" trans="overlap">oh yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah I know I don't understand how how like some people are saying oh wow the mortgages are really good now <pause dur="short"/> now is the time to buy <pause dur="short"/> And I'm thinking no it's not</u>
<u n="241" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah because because they've come down <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> no it's not <pause dur="short"/> because they've come down in price</u>
<u n="242" who="S0024" trans="overlap">the mortgages might be low but the house prices aren't</u>
<u n="243" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and the interest rate set near zero</u>
<u n="244" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="245" who="S0144">that's just to tempt people in <pause dur="short"/> but I think it's just to tempt people in before another crash to be honest <pause dur="short"/> it's going to wipe a lot of people out</u>
<u n="246" who="S0024">yeah? Well they are still too high <pause dur="short"/> I'm not going to buy one</u>
<u n="247" who="S0144" trans="overlap">they're not <pause dur="short"/> if you look at some of this crap</u>
<u n="248" who="S0024">they're high <pause dur="short"/> they are high</u>
<u n="249" who="S0144">what a hundred and sixty grand for a just a some really you know really tiny terraced house with no garden <pause dur="short"/> I'm not paying that <pause dur="short"/> no way</u>
<u n="250" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah for a rubbish <pause dur="short"/> I I was looking around here <pause dur="short"/> there's no <pause dur="short"/> no</u>
<u n="251" who="S0144">no</u>
<u n="252" who="S0024">no it's terrible <pause dur="short"/> I mean there's hardly any garden in it either and I'm really really against buying a flat</u>
<u n="253" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> if you look at the average wage price <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="254" who="S0024">I'm really against buying a flat</u>
<u n="255" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="256" who="S0024">how do people want to buy? Remember those people that we met? Who were they who was? Who was that who was erm buying some flat in some Eastern European country?</u>
<u n="257" who="S0144">yeah that was in Bulgaria</u>
<u n="258" who="S0024" trans="overlap">and they had never been there <pause dur="short"/> they had never seen it <pause dur="short"/> it was all over the internet</u>
<u n="259" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> well that was a big trend <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="260" who="S0024">and  they were just  they were just watching it on the internet being built</u>
<u n="261" who="S0144">yeah yeah <pause dur="short"/> the trouble is that's lease holding as well <pause dur="short"/> they don't own it <pause dur="short"/> they they get it for like a hundred years and then it gets given back to the erm estate or whoever</u>
<u n="262" who="S0024">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="263" who="S0144">so it's <pause dur="short"/> dunno <pause dur="short"/> I'm not into that <pause dur="short"/> that that's maybe short-term profit you could make</u>
<u n="264" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="265" who="S0144">but</u>
<u n="266" who="S0024">yeah you could make some money I suppose</u>
<u n="267" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="268" who="S0024">that's another thing <pause dur="short"/> we need to work out what we're going to do with that money</u>
<u n="269" who="S0144">what in erm?</u>
<u n="270" who="S0024">shares <pause dur="short"/> we've got to buy</u>
<u n="271" who="S0144">waterhouse <pause dur="short"/> tD Waterhouse</u>
<u n="272" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="273" who="S0144">erm yeah because in April they said if you haven't got five thousand something or other in the erm account you're going to get charged some administration fee</u>
<u n="274" who="S0024" trans="overlap">we need to work out <pause dur="short"/> so what are we going to do?</u>
<u n="275" who="S0144">well either we put <pause dur="short"/> I think you can put that money in the day before and then take it out the day after and it will be fine</u>
<u n="276" who="S0024">really?</u>
<u n="277" who="S0144">or we can just take it out and pay the fifty pound withdrawal fine <pause dur="short"/> erm or</u>
<u n="278" who="S0024">but we haven't even used it</u>
<u n="279" who="S0144">I know but I thought it would have crashed before <pause dur="short"/> that was the problem <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>wa</trunc> I was certain it was going to crash before two thousand twelve</u>
<u n="280" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="281" who="S0144">erm but I you know I I still really believe that it's going to the markets going to crash at least this year</u>
<u n="282" who="S0024" trans="overlap">well me too but we've got to be careful with that <pause dur="short"/> I mean what's what's that money doing <pause dur="short"/> I mean they've changed their and everything</u>
<u n="283" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well it's not doing much is it?</u>
<u n="284" who="S0024">no it's just sitting there</u>
<u n="285" who="S0144">yeah but if it was in a bank it wouldn't be doing much more with the zero point zero one percent interest</u>
<u n="286" who="S0024" trans="overlap">no it would still be sitting there but the thing is we're not <pause dur="short"/> I don't know I mean it doesn't seem like a bank it seems like something fictional</u>
<u n="287" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah I know what you mean <pause dur="short"/> so either I don't know <pause dur="short"/> maybe we should just put it into some mining companies</u>
<u n="288" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="289" who="S0144">or withdraw it</u>
<u n="290" who="S0024">I would like to <pause dur="short"/> I think we should look again</u>
<u n="291" who="S0144">you want to gamble it or? Because it is a gamble basically</u>
<u n="292" who="S0024" trans="overlap">we've got to really look and <pause dur="short"/> well I don't want to gamble it all</u>
<u n="293" who="S0144">but it's a gamble based on a bit of knowledge</u>
<u n="294" who="S0024">yeah but if you put all that money into something then that won't be included in the five thousand pounds that you need to have the</u>
<u n="295" who="S0144">yeah it will</u>
<u n="296" who="S0024">it will?</u>
<u n="297" who="S0144">yeah you have to have five thousand or so in your portfolio</u>

<u n="307" who="S0144">yeah</u>
<u n="308" who="S0024">and I don't know it was just like why did you know why were they asking for independence now? Is it because they found loads of gold?</u>
<u n="309" who="S0144"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="310" who="S0024">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> maybe</u>
<u n="311" who="S0144" trans="overlap">they wouldn't be able to keep that a secret</u>
<u n="312" who="S0024">oh they would if they wanted to</u>
<u n="313" who="S0144">they wouldn't <pause dur="short"/> they wouldn't</u>
<u n="314" who="S0024">well if it's a possibility isn't it?</u>
<u n="315" who="S0144">but I know the tin mines are reopening in Cornwall</u>
<u n="316" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="317" who="S0144">because the tin price has gone right up</u>
<u n="318" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="319" who="S0144">I think the gold mines yeah there were some in Scotland wasn't there?</u>
<u n="320" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah yeah</u>

<u n="322" who="S0024">and they're opening them up <pause dur="short"/> and they they want to <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if they found <unclear/> again <pause dur="short"/> it was gold because it was gold <pause dur="short"/> that there was a <trunc>g</trunc></u>
<u n="323" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah there was this guy <pause dur="short"/> I think I saw the same thing</u>
<u n="324" who="S0024" trans="overlap">no because I didn't watch it with you</u>
<u n="325" who="S0144" trans="overlap">there was a guy  on the  on the stream <pause dur="short"/> like sifting it</u>
<u n="326" who="S0024">yeah but I didn't watch that with you <pause dur="short"/> I watched that with mum</u>

<u n="332" who="S0024">yeah he was collecting his only little pieces</u>
<u n="333" who="S0144" trans="overlap">and that was his own project <pause dur="short"/> every day he would go down there and</u>
<u n="334" who="S0024">freeze</u>
<u n="335" who="S0144">but he'd made quite a bit I think <pause dur="short"/> the price of gold at the moment you know and it's only going to go up as well</u>
<u n="336" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="337" who="S0144">which is why I think</u>
<u n="338" who="S0024" trans="overlap">I was just wondering why you know why do they want? I don't know</u>
<u n="339" who="S0144">mm</u>
<u n="340" who="S0024">I can't think of any reason why they want to separate from us really</u>
<u n="341" who="S0144">well I don't know</u>
<u n="342" who="S0024">I think they get quite good benefits from being with us</u>
<u n="343" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I think they've got a very good deal actually from being part of the UK</u>

<u n="348" who="S0024" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> they seem to have a good deal <pause dur="short"/> I don't <pause dur="short"/> but maybe they don't <pause dur="short"/> I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I don't blame them <pause dur="short"/> if they want independence fair enough <pause dur="short"/> give them independence but I just I don't know maybe it's to do with their gold that they've found in some random place</u>
<u n="349" who="S0144" trans="overlap"><vocal desc="laugh"/> They've found all of these millions of ounces of gold</u>
<u n="350" who="S0024">yeah <pause dur="short"/> so then I was thinking well we should look into some Scottish companies and see if there is any that we would like to invest in</u>
<u n="351" who="S0144" trans="overlap">well I <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> and I know some</u>
<u n="352" who="S0024" trans="overlap">because then it's kind of investing close to home and it's not</u>
<u n="353" who="S0144">I know some of the UK mining companies</u>
<u n="354" who="S0024">yeah?</u>
<u n="355" who="S0144">yeah I wrote them down somewhere</u>
<u n="356" who="S0024">so we'll have a look at them <pause dur="short"/> that will be  that will be  funny to have a look at them</u>
<u n="357" who="S0144">yeah?</u>
<u n="358" who="S0024">yeah why not?</u>
<u n="359" who="S0144">yeah cos when you're investing in gold you need to look at the politics of a country to see how stable it is</u>
<u n="360" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="361" who="S0144">the safety of their mining operations</u>
<u n="362" who="S0024">and they are very safe <pause dur="short"/> there I've I looked at all of their safety</u>
<u n="363" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah well yeah Europe would be okay <pause dur="short"/> I mean when you go to places like Chile or China</u>

<u n="377" who="S0144">manufacturing is our biggest export <pause dur="short"/> are you kidding me?</u>
<u n="378" who="S0024">that's what they said on the BBC news <pause dur="short"/> yeah</u>
<u n="379" who="S0144">and what manufacturing is that then?</u>
<u n="380" who="S0024">I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I don't have any idea what kind <pause dur="short"/> what does that mean?</u>
<u n="381" who="S0144">manufacturing</u>

<u n="391" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> yeah <pause dur="short"/> that is crazy yeah <pause dur="short"/> the only the only reason why we're doing better than Brazil is because we're still raping Africa basically</u>
<u n="392" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="393" who="S0144">because we've still got all our finance <pause dur="short"/> the city of London the power is immense</u>
<u n="394" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="395" who="S0144">and they're basically just that's where we get most of out money from <pause dur="short"/> that's the only way we've got our standard of living the way it is</u>
<u n="396" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="397" who="S0144">is because we're fucking other countries over <pause dur="short"/> I mean the Empire is still alive <pause dur="short"/> people think the British Empire is dead</u>

<u n="407" who="S0144">he is <pause dur="short"/> he's a lizard</u>
<u n="408" who="S0024">he looks like a lizard <pause dur="short"/> he really does <pause dur="short"/> it looks oh I don't know <pause dur="short"/> I don't like it <pause dur="short"/> he walks with his head down just like Prince Charles <pause dur="short"/> you know like with his head stuck out</u>
<u n="409" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's horrible</u>
<u n="410" who="S0024" trans="overlap">with his beady eyes <pause dur="short"/> looks weird <pause dur="short"/> I don't like it</u>
<u n="411" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> and</u>
<u n="412" who="S0024">erm but anyway what was I saying? They erm yeah he's over there trying to strengthen our relations but god knows how he's going to do that</u>
<u n="413" who="S0144" trans="overlap">strengthen our relations <pause dur="short"/> is he really doing that or is he just creating an illusion back here?</u>
<u n="414" who="S0024">no he's trying to save it because no but Jamaica was saying oh well we'll separate from you but  we do  we do like having your support so we'll still treat the Queen as exactly the same <pause dur="short"/> she can come and visit <pause dur="short"/> They said she can come and visit and she'll be treated exactly the same <pause dur="short"/> the Prime Minister of Jamaica said that</u>
<u n="415" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> but do you think the average Jamaican is there going oh brilliant Prince Harry's come over oh god I love England?</u>
<u n="416" who="S0024">no <pause dur="short"/> but they did they did say well having a relationship with England has helped us <pause dur="short"/> we get advice and we get this and you know we get support when we want it</u>
<u n="417" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="418" who="S0024">but seriously I mean so if they separate from us</u>
<u n="419" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah well that's over that's with them over a barrel with a gun to their head</u>
<u n="420" who="S0024">if they separate from us what's? Like everybody's separating from us</u>
<u n="421" who="S0144">everyone's splitting up <pause dur="short"/> this is the the trend at the moment <pause dur="short"/> all these countries are becoming smaller</u>
<u n="422" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="423" who="S0144">it it's quite interesting actually <pause dur="short"/> cos I thought it was going to become very erm because like globalisation things were just becoming into one big mass which is what I was scared of</u>
<u n="424" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="425" who="S0144">but a good thing at the moment is there seems to be a trend that countries are actually separating up into smaller groups and things are getting small and <trunc>de</trunc> devolving</u>
<u n="426" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> they are <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't call it devolving <pause dur="short"/> I would call it evolving</u>
<u n="427" who="S0144">well yeah evolving <pause dur="short"/> but that's what it's called devolution</u>
<u n="428" who="S0024">but it's not devolution in my eyes</u>
<u n="429" who="S0144">no no but it's a negative word given for that purpose</u>
<u n="430" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="431" who="S0144">but like Belgium has split in two hasn't it</u>
<u n="432" who="S0024">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="433" who="S0144">and I think this is going to be a</u>
<u n="434" who="S0024" trans="overlap">Sudan just split in two</u>
<u n="435" who="S0144">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think a lot of places <pause dur="short"/> even like you think of somewhere like China <pause dur="short"/> which is the the epitome of oneness <pause dur="short"/> you know when</u>
<u n="436" who="S0024">do you remember when we were in China?</u>
<u n="437" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah exactly</u>
<u n="438" who="S0024">and they they had that north south east west divide didn't they?</u>
<u n="439" who="S0144">they had a huge divide <pause dur="short"/> they hated each other</u>
<u n="440" who="S0024" trans="overlap">they were all just slagging each other off</u>
<u n="441" who="S0144" trans="overlap">they hated each other</u>
<u n="442" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="443" who="S0144">and you think China is just this big Communist kind of mass of working together as <trunc>k</trunc> like a machine but you've got Tibet you've got Taiwan Hong Kong <pause dur="short"/> and you've got all the different states <pause dur="short"/> you've got Outer Mongolia who are very unhappy with the regime <pause dur="short"/> you've got the whole of the the west which is not reaping any of the benefits that the east coast is getting</u>
<u n="444" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="445" who="S0144">and that that's you know that's a huge problem <pause dur="short"/> it's going to break up like Russian did I think <pause dur="short"/> in our lifetime</u>
<u n="446" who="S0024">really? I don't know it seems</u>
<u n="447" who="S0144" trans="overlap">which I think is good</u>
<u n="448" who="S0024">I don't I can't predict anything at the moment it all seems really here and there</u>
<u n="449" who="S0144" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> but then you've got you know there's that big debate who's going to be the next super power India or China? I always thought China because because of the oneness</u>
<u n="450" who="S0024">mm</u>
<u n="451" who="S0144">but I never really thought India because they've got so many religions and so many distinct variations in their country that</u>
<u n="452" who="S0024">they almost always have to stay together because of their differences don't they?</u>
<u n="453" who="S0144" trans="overlap">I mean they've they've got eight hundred and fifty odd languages</u>
<u n="454" who="S0024">yeah I know but they can't separate into little tribes <pause dur="short"/> they have to stick together</u>
<u n="455" who="S0144">well yeah but they <pause dur="short"/> it was such a dysfunctional country wasn't it? In a way</u>
<u n="456" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> well yeah <pause dur="short"/> in a way yeah</u>
<u n="457" who="S0144">in another way not <pause dur="short"/> I mean <trunc>s</trunc> very together in another way <pause dur="short"/> but when you've got that many languages and that many religions all conflicting with each other <pause dur="short"/> I mean they they were in harmony in some places but in other places they weren't</u>
<u n="458" who="S0024">yeah</u>
<u n="459" who="S0144">and I remember in erm Darjeeling you've got the whole Gorkhaland</u>
<u n="460" who="S0024" trans="overlap">oh god <pause dur="short"/> do you remember that?  Do you remember that?</u>
<u n="461" who="S0144">they're trying to get independence going on strikes</u>
<u n="462" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah independence</u>
<u n="463" who="S0144">I mean and that was <pause dur="short"/> and you've got that in Tamil as well in the south erm in the south east who were kind of together with Sri Lanka <pause dur="short"/> that's a completely different culture</u>
<u n="464" who="S0024" trans="overlap">we never went there did we? Never got there</u>
<u n="465" who="S0144">no no but you've got so many <pause dur="short"/> I mean the hill tribes basically <pause dur="short"/> well the people who live in the Himalayas are completely different to the people who live on the lowlands</u>
<u n="466" who="S0024">yeah well you've got</u>
<u n="467" who="S0144">just the mentality is completely different</u>
<u n="468" who="S0024">and because you've got so many Tibetans living there as well all changing the communities</u>
<u n="469" who="S0144" trans="overlap">yeah and you've got that <pause dur="short"/> yeah and then you've got the desert <pause dur="short"/> you've got Rajasthan</u>

<u n="471" who="S0144">and then you've got yeah down by Sri Lanka and then you've ah</u>
<u n="472" who="S0024" trans="overlap">yeah but isn't that what they they love their diversity there?</u>
<u n="473" who="S0144">yeah and so they should but it's not a great recipe for economic dominance <pause dur="short"/> do you know what I mean?</u>
<u n="474" who="S0024" trans="overlap">mm <pause dur="short"/> yeah I suppose <pause dur="short"/> yeah it's weird <pause dur="short"/> do you want to play the game again?</u>
