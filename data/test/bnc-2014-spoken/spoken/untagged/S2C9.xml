<u n="1" who="S0336">exactly <pause dur="short"/> never mind</u>
<u n="2" who="S0362">that's just that's unfortunately that's the nature of the beast innit?</u>
<u n="3" who="S0336">exactly or we</u>
<u n="4" who="S0362" trans="overlap">I have the same we have the same trouble with a with like a big group of us <pause dur="short"/> if a few of them can't make it you <trunc>fe</trunc> like we have we all try and push it like oh you know we'll still do it we'll still do it like</u>
<u n="5" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="6" who="S0362">there's only three of us <pause dur="short"/> in fact two of us really</u>
<u n="7" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="8" who="S0362">and there was another lad that we knew from uni that <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> knew more than I did but you know better</u>
<u n="9" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="10" who="S0362" trans="overlap">than I did but he was still my year but you know <pause dur="short"/> association a bit</u>
<u n="11" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="12" who="S0362">erm but we're like now I'm still gonna do it cos if you don't you just don't see each other</u>
<u n="13" who="S0336">exactly and that's like we go months and months and months without seeing each other so like <pause dur="short"/> we saw each other in December and that was the first time I'd seen them <pause dur="short"/> since like <pause dur="short"/> april that year because erm <pause dur="short"/> I asked them all to come down like a few times like when I bought the house and stuff like that and they just didn't make an effort and then erm <pause dur="short"/> they <pause dur="short"/> all went to <anon type="place"/> the weekend I was in Bestival but they invited me like two weeks beforehand and I was like <pause dur="short"/> either you guys have like <pause dur="short"/> somehow just winged it so that you're all free or this has been a plan for ages and you've only just invited me like it was really weird <pause dur="short"/> so I was like well I'm not free that weekend so <trunc>li</trunc> like</u>
<u n="14" who="S0362">sorry</u>
<u n="15" who="S0336">sorry <pause dur="short"/> erm <pause dur="short"/> but like <pause dur="short"/> I just I dunno like <pause dur="short"/> I'm the first one of us to buy a house and I'm not not not in a braggy kind of way but in a like <pause dur="short"/> if it was any of them</u>
<u n="16" who="S0362">you'd like try to see them</u>
<u n="17" who="S0336">yeah and not a single one like it's an hour on the train they've got no excuse <pause dur="short"/> like they they act like I live miles away and I don't</u>
<u n="18" who="S0362">an hour's really not that far is it?</u>
<u n="19" who="S0336">no and like I appreciate that everybody has their own thing going on but like to say that not a single one of them has given me a single weekend do you know what I mean? or even like popped up for the day like</u>
<u n="20" who="S0362">yeah</u>
<u n="21" who="S0336">pathetic <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="22" who="S0362" trans="overlap">and they could do couldn't they?</u>
<u n="23" who="S0336">they could so easily like</u>
<u n="24" who="S0362" trans="overlap">just have some lunch and go home</u>
<u n="25" who="S0336">exactly</u>
<u n="26" who="S0362">it's really cheap as well on the train</u>
<u n="27" who="S0336">that's what I've said to <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> I was like oh I will literally come and meet you for lunch like <pause dur="short"/> I'll get the train down <pause dur="short"/> we'll spend a couple of hours having lunch walking round shops maybe and then I'll get the train home like it doesn't have to be a a huge thing every time cos like that's the other thing now is like I on the on the days that I do go up it's like it has to be this whole day thing so you're going for breakfast when we first get there and then we're walking round all afternoon and then we're going for dinner and I'm getting like the last train home and I'm thinking like why? like <pause dur="short"/> why is it this whole day thing where all of us ending up having to spend a whole fortune?</u>
<u n="28" who="S0362">yeah</u>
<u n="29" who="S0336">cos that's the other thing you know like <pause dur="short"/> if they came here <pause dur="short"/> they'd have the expense of the train but I'd feed them and I'd put them up <pause dur="short"/> whereas <trunc>w</trunc> the other way round I have the expense of paying the train travel</u>
<u n="30" who="S0362">and then they'd say let's go out for dinner</u>
<u n="31" who="S0336">yeah and then I have to pay for dinner and everything as well so when I went in April last year I spent seventy pounds in one day just to go and see them and I'm like that's so expensive like <pause dur="short"/> the least you could do is say oh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> if you're coming here I'll host like afternoon tea or I'll make some lunch do you know what I mean? like there's just nothing like none of them do it</u>
<u n="32" who="S0362">it's the <anon type="place"/> way isn't it?</u>
<u n="33" who="S0336">it's stupid it's so expensive and like</u>
<u n="34" who="S0362" trans="overlap">I think it's the I think that's the mentality of the of people that live there isn't it?</u>
<u n="35" who="S0336">I know and I just think like <trunc>n</trunc> not one of them has ever offered to like buy me a drink or anything for like considering that I'd paid for like train travel and stuff like that</u>
<u n="36" who="S0362">yeah</u>
<u n="37" who="S0336">so</u>
<u n="38" who="S0362">it's yeah <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="39" who="S0336">but never mind</u>
<u n="40" who="S0362">that's like erm it's like I was up here having conversations with erm <pause dur="short"/> what I can't remember the root of it but like er <pause dur="short"/> right let me get it in my head cos I need to remember <pause dur="short"/> it's something happened</u>
<u n="41" who="S0336"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="42" who="S0362">er cos er if I remember who it is erm it might have a relevance but it might be anyway talking about how people are paying for things and like erm one of the or some of the one of the lads now got married in in America <pause dur="short"/> and he was like yeah boys come <trunc>ov</trunc> come over come over like it'll be class er for my wedding</u>
<u n="43" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="44" who="S0362" trans="overlap">you're gonna be the ushers yeah like sweet ushers like rock over rocked over made them pay for the suit hire suit hire <vocal desc="laugh"/> <pause dur="short"/> and he made them pay for the hotel that they were staying in like the night before the night before the wedding</u>
<u n="45" who="S0336" trans="overlap">even though they had flights to pay for as well</u>
<u n="46" who="S0362">and for all the way to er New York for him and one of them's a lecturer so he had to like wing work off <pause dur="short"/> ridiculous innit? and so I was <trunc>thi</trunc> oh I know what it was <pause dur="short"/> it was <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> telling me about her and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s bridesmaid dresses</u>
<u n="47" who="S0336">oh right yeah</u>
<u n="48" who="S0362">cos she <trunc>sai</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh"/> they told me that they <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> made made her pay for the dresses <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="49" who="S0336">er I don't really <trunc>understa</trunc> like I thought that was a bit of the thing of the past like expecting the bride to pay like if I could afford to buy the bridesmaid dresses I would but I'd like to feel I'd like to think that whoever it was my bridesmaid would understand if I needed them to pay for it do you know what I mean? like I feel like that's a that's a conversation that you should be prepared to have as bridesmaid but they're being a bit awkward about the whole thing anyway it's just</u>
<u n="50" who="S0362">is the er is the thing coming up? er oh yeah no I did hear actually about it</u>
<u n="51" who="S0336">yeah hen do is</u>
<u n="52" who="S0362" trans="overlap">the hen do</u>
<u n="53" who="S0336" trans="overlap">in June erm it's all a bit annoying to be honest I</u>
<u n="54" who="S0362" trans="overlap">it was going to be it's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> sounded said it was sounding like it was gonna be an absolute dead <vocal desc="laugh"/> dead er fish but that was clear but <trunc>th</trunc> when her sister that was like now we need to do more things</u>
<u n="55" who="S0336">yeah like it's a bit awkward cos like what's happened is that <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> have decided and like to be fair it sounds like the kind of thing <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> would like is that erm they've hired this cottage for the weekend which could be really really sweet but there's only fifteen of us which I don't think is a huge amount of people anyway erm and it's quite a big cottage from what I can gather and so and because they've picked this like top-notch cottage with a hot tub and all this kind of stuff</u>
<u n="56" who="S0362">expensive</u>
<u n="57" who="S0336">it's quite expensive so people are paying like a hundred quid a hundred and something quid for three nights in this place right? and obviously people are also having to book time off work and they're having to book the Friday and the Monday off work erm <pause dur="short"/> but what they haven't contemplated is if you are asking people to go to just like a house for the weekend you've got to put some serious planning into like keeping those people entertained for the entire weekend and people were kind of <trunc>s</trunc> sort of saying like oh you know like I'm on a budget I can't do loads I can't spend loads of money so <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> have been trying to come up with different ideas to like do things on the cheap <pause dur="short"/> erm but one of their activities that they were suggesting for us to do during the day was to go quad biking which most of us like were like oh that sounds quite cool but it was fifty pound per person which is quite a lot of money erm so a lot of people were like no I'm not gonna do it so before you know it they were like oh we're gonna have to we'll have to get rid of the quad biking so then people are like oh so what are we gonna do instead? and people start suggesting things and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> are getting really tetchy then cos people are kind of like <pause dur="short"/> taking over or sort of saying you know like one person will say something and if a few people like it you've suddenly got a whole group of people that are going oh yeah we should definitely do this</u>
<u n="58" who="S0362">like oh shit that's that's my idea <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="59" who="S0336">exactly so it's just a bit awkward so erm <pause dur="short"/> I don't know I think <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> have kind of taken the reins back a little bit now but I just don't know what <pause dur="short"/> it could be a really nice weekend <pause dur="short"/> but I think it's gonna be quite cliquey in that like people will stick to the people that they know</u>
<u n="60" who="S0362">yeah</u>
<u n="61" who="S0336">erm <pause dur="short"/> and I think it will I think it could be a bit boring at times so I think you will have people going off and like <pause dur="short"/> you know I can imagine <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s mum <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> maybe going off for a walk if they want to go and explore a little bit and they might have a couple of stragglers with them but then other people might wanna stay in and play games or do you know what I mean? I think it's gonna be a bit of a weird one but like</u>
<u n="62" who="S0362">that could be nice though</u>
<u n="63" who="S0336">I think so I mean what I don't really understand is like</u>
<u n="64" who="S0362">or <trunc>sh</trunc> <trunc>sh</trunc> or they should allow what I would do in that situation like right you know <pause dur="short"/> there's er this <trunc>m</trunc> morning or till three o'clock</u>
<u n="65" who="S0336">do what you like</u>
<u n="66" who="S0362">you can do what you like</u>
<u n="67" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="68" who="S0362">you you can go away and <trunc>s</trunc> and explore</u>
<u n="69" who="S0336" trans="overlap">and I think you need to do that for a whole weekend like you can't plan like forty-eight fifty-eight odd hours' worth of entertainment it's stupid you might as well say like oh so this morning like erm you can do whatever you like here's a couple of things you could do in the local area or you can just do whatever you want but like what they've done is they've picked the cottage because it's pretty and they've not really looked at the location so what they've done is booked the place and then looked at the location and thought oh</u>
<u n="70" who="S0362">shit there's nothing there</u>
<u n="71" who="S0336" trans="overlap">there's nothing here <pause dur="short"/> and it's you just wouldn't would you? like if you were gonna pick a nice cottage you'd probably make sure that A there's some either a nice walk or like there's some sort of activity that you could do <pause dur="short"/> but there's nothing</u>
<u n="72" who="S0362">but <trunc>li</trunc></u>
<u n="73" who="S0336" trans="overlap">apart from this quad biking yeah nothing <pause dur="long"/> and it's awkward as well cos like they've picked somewhere that's three hours away from here but kind of in the arse end of nowhere so everybody's got to drive <pause dur="short"/> and you've got fifteen people that don't all know each other like trying to coordinate lifts so like some are going down early some are some are going down late like <pause dur="short"/> and then because they're staying in a cottage they want to do a massive food shop and take food with us so they're charging everybody X amount for food but obviously they're gonna effectively dictate what people are eating for the weekend I'm just like oh <trunc>th</trunc> it's just awkward they've they've they've given themselves a really tough job</u>
<u n="74" who="S0362">in that situation again what I would do is I'd take I'd <unclear/> going I'd make sure I've got erm <pause dur="short"/> a cooked breakfast for every day che-che-che easy</u>
<u n="75" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="76" who="S0362">everyone can have what they want of that <pause dur="short"/> lunch I would just get loads of bread and</u>
<u n="77" who="S0336">sandwich fillings</u>
<u n="78" who="S0362">just sandwich filling</u>
<u n="79" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="80" who="S0362">and they can just make that and for and for tea you just do like buffet</u>
<u n="81" who="S0336">yeah or you could even like cos there's fifteen of us you could just like divide people into groups and sort of say right on night one these people are cooking so <trunc>betwee</trunc> between now and then like think about what you wanna cook and then send us a list and we'll add it to the shop or whatever so then every night you've got different people cooking <pause dur="short"/> it's just hard <pause dur="short"/> yeah I'm leaving them to me and <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> are staying well and truly out of it like it got so cringe cos like</u>
<u n="82" who="S0362"><vocal desc="laugh"/> oh no</u>
<u n="83" who="S0336">cos like</u>
<u n="84" who="S0362" trans="overlap">I can imagine them hating life</u>
<u n="85" who="S0336">yeah and like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was starting to like demand strippers and shit like that and you're just like oh that's so <trunc>ta</trunc></u>
<u n="86" who="S0362" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0336">yeah and you just think like it's <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>'s hen do I can't see <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> finding a stripper funny and also <pause dur="short"/> strippers are awkward at the best of times but more awkward when you have to like get them to come to your house like it's not as if you're like out in a club and it's a bit funny like <pause dur="short"/> they come into a cottage of fifteen girls like that's not enough of crowd for it to be the</u>
<u n="88" who="S0362" trans="overlap">not the most outgoing group of girls</u>
<u n="89" who="S0336" trans="overlap">no <pause dur="short"/> and I'm just like we're not</u>
<u n="90" who="S0362">with you lot with your girls</u>
<u n="91" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="92" who="S0362">then I would</u>
<u n="93" who="S0336">you could see it</u>
<u n="94" who="S0362" trans="overlap">cos it would just be bad like</u>
<u n="95" who="S0336">exactly</u>
<u n="96" who="S0362">they'd just they'd just like take the piss out of him</u>
<u n="97" who="S0336" trans="overlap">it's just not the right group of people at all and it's just</u>
<u n="98" who="S0362">is it gonna happen?</u>
<u n="99" who="S0336">I don't know I think they've actually opted for a butler in the buff which I think is actually more awkward so some mate who's gonna serve us cocktails naked or with a like a little apron on <pause dur="long"/> yeah</u>
<u n="100" who="S0362"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="101" who="S0336">it's so weird</u>

<u n="468" who="S0362">trouble is <pause dur="short"/> when you do all the like all do all the maths and blah-blah-blah you can literally get abroad</u>

<u n="470" who="S0362" trans="overlap">for a week for the same price</u>
<u n="471" who="S0336">yeah like we for five nights like when I first had a look for five nights like self-catered in <pause dur="short"/> in <pause dur="short"/> cornwall it was coming up at like five six hundred pounds which er which is how much we paid to go abroad last year</u>
<u n="472" who="S0362">it what five or six hundred pound for the couple?</u>
<u n="473" who="S0336">we yeah it's <trunc>fi</trunc> so yeah so we paid we paid <pause dur="short"/> five hundred and something pound each to go on that Neilson holiday last June and this Cornwall place was like five hundred pounds for like self-catered accommodation but then obviously you'd have food and all your activities on top of that whereas like we we were</u>

<u n="742" who="S0362" trans="overlap">no not at all</u>
<u n="743" who="S0336" trans="overlap">never like I I've never</u>
<u n="744" who="S0362" trans="overlap">I remember the time I remember a time when erm when <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> said to me like yeah people will bitch like at everyone but nobody's ever bitched to me about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/></u>
<u n="745" who="S0336">no and I</u>
<u n="746" who="S0362" trans="overlap">and that just says it all</u>

<u n="748" who="S0362">no</u>
<u n="749" who="S0336">like and like I know that sounds stupid because <trunc>t</trunc> talk behind people's backs but I honestly like I just don't know what they'd say about me like</u>
<u n="750" who="S0362">well er they clearly don't</u>
<u n="751" who="S0336">and erm I love having them around and I I like the fact that they're sounds really bad but they're there in the background so if I want them they're there</u>
<u n="752" who="S0362">yeah</u>
<u n="753" who="S0336">but if I don't have time for them then I don't have time for them but so I couldn't imagine just like cutting myself off from them completely and I actually really enjoy spending time with them</u>
<u n="754" who="S0362" trans="overlap">well that's good yeah</u>
<u n="755" who="S0336">but I'm just a bit I feel sorry for <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> because like</u>
<u n="756" who="S0362">she's their the <trunc>tar</trunc> or the target <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="757" who="S0336">yeah and also like I think she's almost it sounds really stupid but like by sort of saying like oh I can't be bothered with it but then turning up every so often she makes it almost worse for herself because like</u>
<u n="758" who="S0362" trans="overlap">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I agree</u>
<u n="759" who="S0336">the time that she does turn up like she'll like she and maybe rightly so she kind of expects people to care that she's there but the people are just a bit like why should we care the one time you decide to turn up?</u>
<u n="760" who="S0362">yeah I can understand</u>
<u n="761" who="S0336" trans="overlap">like it's <trunc>awkwar</trunc> it's really awkward and I'm like stuck in the middle of it because they always ask me about <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> like even last night like she hadn't bothered telling anybody else that she wasn't coming so like <pause dur="short"/> I basically said on the girl's group like oh erm dinner at <anon type="place"/> for my birthday let me know if you can make it and everybody else said yes and like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> just like rather than cos she doesn't wanna look bad she won't say like oh I can't make it so she just won't say anything but then it's even more noticeable so like erm today <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> was just like <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> question mark like asking like cos she said like oh <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> what are you doing for your birthday? and then nobody replied and then she put <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> question mark like to say like oh she's away <pause dur="short"/> and apparently <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> had to like <pause dur="short"/> like text her to say like are you coming tonight? do I need to play like lay an extra place? because she just doesn't say anything <pause dur="short"/> and then it just makes yourself it I dunno that's what makes her a target do you know what I mean? it's really bad</u>
<u n="762" who="S0362">yeah but like <pause dur="short"/> cos she's not been able to go to a few things she's probably thinking oh no I</u>
<u n="763" who="S0336">it looks bad</u>
<u n="764" who="S0362" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="f"/> knows I'm not going like</u>

<u n="1517" who="S0336">I know I went for my interview erm for my new job in and then I went drove straight on after that and I knew it was a big like huge like car warehousy type thing so it wasn't gonna be like a dodgy like <pause dur="short"/> second-hand place with like dodgy <unclear/> it was gonna be like a</u>

<u n="1714" who="S0362">yeah like <pause dur="short"/> but every six months</u>
<u n="1715" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="1716" who="S0362">it come in like <vocal desc="misc"/> fuck like three hundred quid</u>

<u n="1719" who="S0336">no <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="1720" who="S0362">as if you want <trunc>th</trunc> I don't think mine was that much</u>
<u n="1721" who="S0336">a hundred and eighty pounds yeah I could only ever afford to do six months at a time and it was still like ninety-five quid</u>
<u n="1722" who="S0362">that's outrageous <vocal desc="laugh"/> but obviously with direct debit <pause dur="short"/> you obviously do pay a little bit more</u>
<u n="1723" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="1724" who="S0362">but twelve pound a month</u>
<u n="1725" who="S0336">it's a lot more affordable</u>
<u n="1726" who="S0362">twelve pound a month is erm <pause dur="short"/> I <trunc>t</trunc> that's alright</u>
<u n="1727" who="S0336">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that would be about right <pause dur="short"/> that would be a hundred and forty-four yeah?</u>
<u n="1728" who="S0362">yeah that's right <pause dur="short"/> I dunno I I oh yeah I dunno hard decision obviously it can't be more than sixty quid a year obviously wasn't going twelve months was it?</u>
<u n="1729" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="1730" who="S0362">a long day</u>
<u n="1731" who="S0336">mm</u>
<u n="1732" who="S0362">yeah so obviously that's it's so much better doing it that way than getting chunked out cos you don't you don't see it you just do it</u>
<u n="1733" who="S0336" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="1734" who="S0362">it goes out and it goes</u>
<u n="1735" who="S0336">so what gym does <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> use at the moment?</u>
<u n="1736" who="S0362"><anon type="place"/></u>
<u n="1737" who="S0336">really? does she like it?</u>
<u n="1738" who="S0362" trans="overlap">mm loves it</u>
<u n="1739" who="S0336">cos I know like quite a lot of people are raving cos they've got good classes and stuff on and everything now as well isn't there?</u>
<u n="1740" who="S0362" trans="overlap">yeah she's gone to so many classes and I I'm I'm really <trunc>en</trunc> like appreciative of the way they they've run it and the way they've got it all set up it's <trunc>ver</trunc> they've clearly done their research</u>
<u n="1741" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="1742" who="S0362"><trunc>w</trunc> cos I know I know he has because I know er <anon type="name" nameType="m"/>'s dad is a big businessman</u>
<u n="1743" who="S0336">yeah</u>
<u n="1744" who="S0362">but I'd say <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> pays what does she pay? <vocal desc="misc"/> like thirty <pause dur="short"/> thirty quid a month?</u>
<u n="1745" who="S0336">it's not a lot</u>
<u n="1746" who="S0362">maybe? er I'm <trunc>th</trunc> that sounds about right <pause dur="short"/> and so basically you you can either buy a erm a gym membership or a classes membership so you what it's the <trunc>sa</trunc> same price right is this got really weird acoustics? like <vocal desc="misc"/> I can hear myself like ringing in the background</u>
<u n="1747" who="S0336">dunno</u>

<u n="1752" who="S0362">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I can hear me coming back to me erm <pause dur="short"/> so obviously that's really good <pause dur="short"/> so you pay either <trunc>ei</trunc> gym or classes and then whatever you want to pay <pause dur="short"/> so for example if she wanted to go to the gym so she's got a classes membership if she wanted to go to the gym it would cost her like three pound a time to do it <pause dur="short"/> or if it was the other way round it would just like cost you three pound a class whatever it would be <pause dur="short"/> so that's really good</u>
<u n="1753" who="S0336">yeah</u>
