<u n="11" who="S0680" trans="overlap">oh <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> used to do that</u>

<u n="13" who="S0680" trans="overlap"><anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> did VAX at <anon type="place"/> I think</u>
<u n="14" who="S0679">it all linked in and then</u>
<u n="15" who="S0680" trans="overlap">were they big <trunc>ca</trunc>big cabinets? did they have erm platters on them? whatever you call those like big <pause dur="short"/> or were they tape things? er what did they have going? you don't know? cos <anon type="name" nameType="m"/> used to work on VAXs like washing machines</u>
<u n="16" who="S0679">yeah yeah</u>
<u n="17" who="S0680" trans="overlap">yeah</u>
<u n="18" who="S0679">there were four cos there was one of them and then they got four of them</u>

<u n="29" who="S0680">these machines if there was a problem erm so you didn't <trunc>dam</trunc> so the whatever it was head of the thing or whatever didn't damage you had to switch it off really quick and there was a sequence</u>

<u n="111" who="S0680">erm but he wasn't academic but he was very bright</u>

<u n="134" who="S0679">whether they actually fix these things or even in the garage they clip the computer on now don't they?</u>

<u n="242" who="S0679">yes</u>
<u n="243" who="S0680">now that one you open it up and it clips into and it goes into a hook</u>
<u n="244" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="245" who="S0680">well if you pick it up</u>
<u n="246" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="247" who="S0680">unless you put your hand under and hold that it collapses</u>
<u n="248" who="S0679">I'm very nervous about moving this one actually</u>
<u n="249" who="S0680">well this one's alright cos it's got a peg</u>
<u n="250" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="251" who="S0680">it's got a peg in it as long as the peg's in it <unclear>well</unclear> it stands up without the peg in it</u>
<u n="252" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="253" who="S0680">but it has a little peg <unclear/></u>
<u n="254" who="S0679">I didn't go for these rubberwood ones because I just really wasn't <unclear>up to it</unclear></u>
<u n="255" who="S0680" trans="overlap">yeah it depends how high they are but that little one that's why</u>
<u n="256" who="S0679" trans="overlap">they look quite nice</u>
<u n="257" who="S0680">that little one's quite a nice just small size</u>
<u n="258" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="259" who="S0680">that's why I have it in the house</u>
<u n="260" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="261" who="S0680">but er that's why I tie string round the tops</u>
<u n="262" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm mm</u>
<u n="263" who="S0680">because</u>
<u n="264" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="265" who="S0680">you know you don't want it collapsing</u>
<u n="266" who="S0679" trans="overlap">you don't want it collapsing absolutely</u>
<u n="267" who="S0680">and my little table that's at the side of the settee with the drop leaves</u>
<u n="268" who="S0679">mm</u>
<u n="269" who="S0680">the small ones it's all very well cos you pull out these things that hold the flaps up</u>
<u n="270" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="271" who="S0680">but if you put something heavy on one side it tips up</u>
<u n="272" who="S0679" trans="overlap">yes</u>
<u n="273" who="S0680">it's alright if you put it on the sides where the solid bit is</u>
<u n="274" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm yeah</u>
<u n="275" who="S0680">but if you put it on the other side it tips up because it it <trunc>ch</trunc> hasn't got another gate leg</u>
<u n="276" who="S0679">mm mm</u>
<u n="277" who="S0680">which I didn't appreciate at the time</u>
<u n="278" who="S0679"><unclear>it's hard to though</unclear> I mean one assumes that <unclear>these</unclear> are made gonna be made in a sensible way</u>
<u n="279" who="S0680">well it's made it's nicely made</u>
<u n="280" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="281" who="S0680">it's got <trunc>ni</trunc> it's nicely made</u>
<u n="282" who="S0679">I think there were quite a few of those tables with a similar sort of problem</u>
<u n="283" who="S0680">but if you buy one with the <trunc>e</trunc> you know so you can get little ones with gate legs</u>
<u n="284" who="S0679" trans="overlap">mm</u>
<u n="285" who="S0680">but they're obviously more expensive because what I used to do with that one was put one leaf up you know and have a half circle table</u>
<u n="286" who="S0679">mm mm</u>
<u n="287" who="S0680">next to me but you can't put things on one side</u>
