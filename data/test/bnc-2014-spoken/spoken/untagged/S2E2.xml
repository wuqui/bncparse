<u n="1" who="S0030">hello <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I'm <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="2" who="S0096">and I'm <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> </u>
<u n="3" who="S0030">and we're careers consultants here at um the university <pause dur="short"/> so thanks for asking us to do this <anon type="name" nameType="n"/> <pause dur="short"/> um what we thought we'd talk about um for a short period of time um is about CVs <pause dur="short"/> because as careers er consultants or advisers we end up <trunc>l</trunc> spending a lot of our time thinking and talking about CVs <pause dur="short"/> um for people who are actually applying for jobs <pause dur="short"/> so um they consume a lot of our time and energy <pause dur="short"/> um and they're something that we know a lot about but also probably drive us mad on occasion</u>
<u n="4" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="5" who="S0030"><trunc>S</trunc></u>
<u n="6" who="S0096">I would agree</u>
<u n="7" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="8" who="S0096">at the end of the day they are the number one query if we had to kind of <trunc>p</trunc> er compile a list of everything that we do <pause dur="short"/> cVs are the number one query <pause dur="short"/> and I guess the thing about CVs is first and foremost there is no right or wrong answer is there</u>
<u n="9" who="S0030">mm <pause dur="short"/> I know  I know  And people come um and it's a very important thing actually <pause dur="short"/> your CV <pause dur="short"/> I can understand why people worry about it really <pause dur="short"/> because it is your calling card <pause dur="short"/> it is your your document which if you're applying for a job or anything you you really wanna make sure um it's good <pause dur="short"/> um I've probably in my time seen thousands of CVs <pause dur="short"/> and I'm always amazed about how very clever people can actually er sort of struggle sometimes to actually present themselves very well in a CV really <pause dur="short"/> so um so we spend a lot of our time sort of talking to people really <pause dur="short"/> and people talk about chronological CVs and skills-based CVs</u>
<u n="10" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="11" who="S0030">and infographic CVs and and so on <pause dur="short"/> um so a lot of time you know it's talking to people about what kind of CV um they like <pause dur="short"/> and er I mean my personal thing is huh I've got a <trunc>v</trunc> a kind of a view-point that I think actually doing the CV's really useful <pause dur="short"/> because it makes people think about themselves</u>
<u n="12" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="13" who="S0030">and er who they are <pause dur="short"/> and what they wanna say about themselves <pause dur="short"/> and and often sometimes people when they do their first draft of the CV it's very much like a list <pause dur="short"/> as er sometimes as careers advisers we're trying to kind of get them to think well you may have had as a student maybe a very ordinary job in a bar <pause dur="short"/> but what were your responsibilities? What skills did you develop? And um just people need quite a bit of coaxing to do that and to move away</u>
<u n="14" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="15" who="S0030">from just a check-list of little things they've done</u>
<u n="16" who="S0096">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think it's sometimes people just see it as quite an it's kind of not a natural thing to do <pause dur="short"/> and maybe it's er a British thing where we're a little bit more reserved about our achievements <pause dur="short"/> and it's changing your mindset</u>
<u n="17" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="18" who="S0096">about having to do that <pause dur="short"/> because</u>
<u n="19" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="20" who="S0096">for all the changes to recruitment CVs are still predominantly</u>
<u n="21" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="22" who="S0096">asked</u>
<u n="23" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="24" who="S0096">by a lot of the major sectors</u>
<u n="25" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="26" who="S0096">so people are still</u>
<u n="27" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="28" who="S0096">unsure of how to phrase them and what people</u>
<u n="29" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="30" who="S0096">look for</u>
<u n="31" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="32" who="S0096">and that's when we say there's so many wide and varied occupations <pause dur="short"/> it's doing your research first <pause dur="short"/> that's the thing <pause dur="short"/> don't produce a CV and then look for work</u>
<u n="33" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="34" who="S0096">look for the opportunities <pause dur="short"/> think about what suits your needs <pause dur="short"/> what you're looking for now <pause dur="short"/> be it part-time work or be it an academic position</u>
<u n="35" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="36" who="S0096">and then tailor</u>
<u n="37" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="38" who="S0096">your CV <pause dur="short"/> and I think it's trying to trouble-shoot some of the myths round CVs</u>
<u n="39" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="40" who="S0096">and</u>
<u n="41" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="42" who="S0096">and the questions people have <pause dur="short"/> and people struggle <pause dur="short"/> because they'll produce a CV</u>
<u n="43" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="44" who="S0096">and then just say what kind of work can I go for?</u>
<u n="45" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="46" who="S0096">so as a starting point it's the other way round <pause dur="short"/> think about what you're looking for</u>
<u n="47" who="S0030">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="48" who="S0096">you know <pause dur="short"/> what type of opportunity? Where are you now</u>
<u n="49" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="50" who="S0096">in terms of your career planning?</u>
<u n="51" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="52" who="S0096">and then</u>
<u n="53" who="S0030">mhm</u>
<u n="54" who="S0096">produce a CV to match that</u>
<u n="55" who="S0030">so Tahira do you think that people should always have an up-to-date CV?</u>
<u n="56" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="57" who="S0030">and have you got an up-to-date CV?</u>
<u n="58" who="S0096"><vocal desc="laugh"/> No</u>
<u n="59" who="S0030"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="60" who="S0096">this it's funny you should ask me that actually <pause dur="short"/> cos just recently I've been looking at my CV <pause dur="short"/> it's not completely done <pause dur="short"/> but yes</u>
<u n="61" who="S0030">and what does your CV look like? What kind of headings do you have on your CV?</u>
<u n="62" who="S0096">my CV has a personal profile <pause dur="short"/> so obviously my name and my contact details <pause dur="short"/> and then a personal profile <pause dur="short"/> which is basically the years of work experience I've had <pause dur="short"/> my professional qualification <pause dur="short"/> and the career opportunities I'd be looking for <pause dur="short"/> and then my work history <pause dur="short"/> and then my education and a skills section</u>
<u n="63" who="S0030">okay <pause dur="short"/> okay</u>
<u n="64" who="S0096">what about you</u>
<u n="65" who="S0030"><trunc>S</trunc></u>
<u n="66" who="S0096">Fiona? It's an interesting one isn't it?</u>
<u n="67" who="UNKMULTI"><vocal desc="laugh"/></u>
<u n="68" who="S0096">er to ask a careers adviser</u>
<u n="69" who="S0030">it is  it is  Um <pause dur="short"/> well I've not updated my CV very recently <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but my CV has got er my personal details at the top <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I very much have my name at the top rather than curriculum vitae <pause dur="short"/> I always tell students don't have curriculum vitae at the top of your CV <pause dur="short"/> put your name in big bold letters at the top of your CV <pause dur="short"/> I'll then have kind of what I call a personal profile stroke career objective where I try to convey what is my unique selling points</u>
<u n="70" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="71" who="S0030">and summary of who I am together with what it is that I'm seeking <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so that's my kind of <trunc>c</trunc> short career objective <pause dur="short"/> which would be probably no more than about three lines <pause dur="short"/> I then have a section which is um personal skills stroke strengths <pause dur="short"/> so I actually identify things that I think I'm very good at that I choose <trunc>t</trunc> which kind of capture my skills and my achievements together in one section</u>
<u n="72" who="S0096">oh that's er interesting <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="73" who="S0030">so I've got that next on my CV</u>
<u n="74" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="75" who="S0030">and then I've got um in reverse chronological order my employment</u>
<u n="76" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="77" who="S0030">um <pause dur="short"/> so um detailing my responsibilities um so far in different jobs that I've had <pause dur="short"/> as I've been working for a long time now I er I probably can lose some of the jobs that I did a long time ago <pause dur="short"/> and within that I try to interweave</u>
<u n="78" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="79" who="S0030">responsibilities and <trunc>s</trunc> skills within within the those section <pause dur="short"/> and then I'd have maybe a section which is achievements <pause dur="short"/> which is more kind of miscellaneous things <pause dur="short"/> it could be about maybe voluntary work that I've done <pause dur="short"/> currently or in the past <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> I might have a section as well which is more I've forgotten my education section needs to be in there <pause dur="short"/> what my qualifications</u>
<u n="80" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="81" who="S0030">are <pause dur="short"/> I'll also have a training section if I've participated in any kind of work-based training <pause dur="short"/> which isn't really a qualification as such <pause dur="short"/> not like having a masters or a degree <pause dur="short"/> it's more like having a qualification in psychometric testing or something <pause dur="short"/> and then I would have interests as well <pause dur="short"/> cos I think that interests do indicate you're a little bit of a rounded person <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> and then I'd have at the bottom references available on request</u>
<u n="82" who="S0096">ah</u>
<u n="83" who="S0030">and even though I've been working now for quite a long time over twenty years really I'd still probably try to get my CV on two pages <pause dur="short"/> with my with the view that it's two pages of my best bits</u>
<u n="84" who="S0096">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think yeah maybe it's worthwhile er actually then covering CV etiquette</u>
<u n="85" who="S0030">yeah</u>
<u n="86" who="S0096">Cos I think that's the other thing it's how long should a CV be?</u>
<u n="87" who="S0030">yeah</u>
<u n="88" who="S0096">and then I always sort of say well who's it aimed at?</u>
<u n="89" who="S0030">mhm</u>
<u n="90" who="S0096">and what type of opportunity?</u>
<u n="91" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="92" who="S0096">so what would you say for a part-time CV? How long? Part-time job CV</u>
<u n="93" who="S0030">um <pause dur="short"/> I think it depends <pause dur="short"/> if you're a brand new er um undergraduate and you've</u>
<u n="94" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="95" who="S0030">not worked very much and you've only got GCSEs or A-Levels then probably a page is long enough</u>
<u n="96" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="97" who="S0030">um <pause dur="short"/> so really I'd say a page or two pages <pause dur="short"/> but you know if you are a mature <trunc>s</trunc> student and you come in and you've got quite a bit of experience you might not want to lose some of that <pause dur="short"/> so you'd want two pages</u>
<u n="98" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="99" who="S0030">um <pause dur="short"/> I do really it's interesting I have <trunc>s</trunc> we have <trunc>s</trunc> I'm sure you're the same Tahira so many people who come with really quite long CVs <pause dur="short"/> and um huh they might have a whole half a page which is just their personal details</u>
<u n="100" who="S0096">yes</u>
<u n="101" who="S0030">you know nicely laid out and spaced out <pause dur="short"/> and um and I think there are cultural differences here <pause dur="short"/> but I do always say to people it's two pages of your best bits <pause dur="short"/> so</u>
<u n="102" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="103" who="S0030">it's not supposed to be like a comprehensive document of absolutely everything you've done <pause dur="short"/> um</u>
<u n="104" who="S0096">er it's interesting about cultural differences as well though isn't it</u>
<u n="105" who="S0030">yeah</u>
<u n="106" who="S0096">I think er from what I see from a lot of international students is the the er the information of of mm you know wanting to put more information on</u>
<u n="107" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="108" who="S0096">so obviously the</u>
<u n="109" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="110" who="S0096">I've seen a lot of CVs where they run</u>
<u n="111" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="112" who="S0096">to three or four</u>
<u n="113" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="114" who="S0096">pages <pause dur="short"/> I think the most I've seen is seven pages</u>
<u n="115" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="116" who="S0096">I don't know <vocal desc="laugh"/> how many</u>
<u n="117" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="118" who="S0096">pages you've seen</u>
<u n="119" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="120" who="S0096">for the most</u>
<u n="121" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="122" who="S0096">um <pause dur="short"/> but other things there that I wouldn't ordinarily</u>
<u n="123" who="S0030">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="124" who="S0096">see <pause dur="short"/> you know things like</u>
<u n="125" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="126" who="S0096">your health</u>
<u n="127" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="128" who="S0096">and whether you're a smoker or a</u>
<u n="129" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="130" who="S0096">non-smoker</u>
<u n="131" who="S0030">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="132" who="S0096">your marital status</u>
<u n="133" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="134" who="S0096">which I know we've not seen for a number of years</u>
<u n="135" who="S0030">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="136" who="S0096">um <pause dur="short"/> and things about signing off your CV as a declaration of</u>
<u n="137" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="138" who="S0096">the truth</u>
<u n="139" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="140" who="S0096">and I think there are a lot to be said in</u>
<u n="141" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="142" who="S0096">terms of cultural differences in the <anon type="place"/> CV</u>
<u n="143" who="S0030">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="144" who="S0096">photos</u>
<u n="145" who="S0030">that's right  that's right  Yeah <pause dur="short"/> it's funny isn't it <pause dur="short"/> people even after we've been doing this a long time <pause dur="short"/> people will still surprise me for their questions <pause dur="short"/> like I think only a couple of weeks ago a student said to me why do I need to put my address on my CV?</u>
<u n="146" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="147" who="S0030">and I was a bit surprised really cos I thought well well kind of because you want the employer to contact you <pause dur="short"/> so you want to give them as many ways as possible to contact you <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> so why wouldn't you put your address on it really? So it seemed um a strange question to me <pause dur="short"/> even though they may well have a point and actually really um give an e-mail address they're probably gonna be contacting you through e-mail <pause dur="short"/> through phone <pause dur="short"/> why do they actually need your address?</u>
<u n="148" who="S0096">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I know</u>
<u n="149" who="S0030">so it's quite</u>
<u n="150" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="151" who="S0030">it's a reasonable point <pause dur="short"/> even though I would always tend to assume you should put your address</u>
<u n="152" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="153" who="S0030">on a CV really</u>
<u n="154" who="S0096">I would agree with you <pause dur="short"/> because I think it depends on the type of employer doesn't it</u>
<u n="155" who="S0030">yeah</u>
<u n="156" who="S0096">and the opportunity</u>
<u n="157" who="S0030">yeah</u>
<u n="158" who="S0096">but as we know if it's a council on the <trunc>e</trunc> I mean CVs might be the first</u>
<u n="159" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="160" who="S0096">thing they accept</u>
<u n="161" who="S0030">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="162" who="S0096">you might be sent an application form</u>
<u n="163" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="164" who="S0096">or you might be sent additional</u>
<u n="165" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="166" who="S0096">literature</u>
<u n="167" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="168" who="S0096">things that they need to</u>
<u n="169" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="170" who="S0096">to cover <pause dur="short"/> so it's it's useful like you say to give them all avenues to cover <pause dur="short"/> but interestingly what do you think about putting more than one contact number down? Or more than one address? Or more than one e-mail?</u>
<u n="171" who="S0030">um <pause dur="short"/> okay <pause dur="short"/> alright <pause dur="short"/> well my view would be that um you want to make it er easier for the employer</u>
<u n="172" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="173" who="S0030">to contact you <pause dur="short"/> so if you want to give them more than one phone number <pause dur="short"/> like a landline and a mobile number <pause dur="short"/> or two e-mail addresses <pause dur="short"/> one your own e-mail and one your student e-mail <pause dur="short"/> then then do it <pause dur="short"/> but obviously don't go over <trunc>t</trunc> over the top</u>
<u n="174" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="175" who="S0030">um <pause dur="short"/> don't if you are  if you are  gonna include a few contact details try and make sure that doesn't kind of then take up a load of space on your page really</u>
<u n="176" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="177" who="S0030">so I I would be fairly um relaxed about kind of contact details <pause dur="short"/> I wouldn't be saying to people you only should put one on</u>
<u n="178" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="179" who="S0030">what about you <anon type="name" nameType="f"/>?</u>
<u n="180" who="S0096">you see I I kind of take a different view</u>
<u n="181" who="S0030">do you? Okay</u>
<u n="182" who="S0096">I I do say make it easy for the employer <pause dur="short"/> so put one on that you know you're gonna check all the time</u>
<u n="183" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="184" who="S0096">and same for students <pause dur="short"/> if you're living in shared accommodation or student</u>
<u n="185" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="186" who="S0096">accommodation and you're worried about your mail then have it to a secure address</u>
<u n="187" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="188" who="S0096">whether it's your</u>
<u n="189" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="190" who="S0096">family or somebody else</u>
<u n="191" who="S0030">yeah</u>
<u n="192" who="S0096">then then</u>

<u n="241" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="242" who="S0096">is lack of self-awareness</u>
<u n="243" who="S0030">but do you not think that it's better to interweave your skills into your um achievements or your jobs? Rather than having a separate skills section <pause dur="short"/> that's what some people think</u>

<u n="248" who="S0096">mm er the I think one of the things that really also I find frustrating on CVs is when you know people have copied and pasted the same job duties for like three or four different job roles</u>

<u n="250" who="S0096">and as an employer you would guess okay well they've not</u>

<u n="256" who="S0096">and I think you can show that <pause dur="short"/> so I think that's what you need to do is to aim for <unclear/> um demonstrating your responsibilities but having a separate section <pause dur="short"/> so you can still say you planned or you coordinated or you have <trunc>exper</trunc> experience in</u>
<u n="257" who="S0030">mm</u>

<u n="259" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="260" who="S0096">but then also have a skills section</u>

<u n="271" who="S0030">and um do you put your date of birth on your CV?</u>
<u n="272" who="S0096">yeah <pause dur="short"/> that's an interesting one <pause dur="short"/> see I I would say follow the guidelines for CVs or applications from the advert <pause dur="short"/> but I wouldn't put it on there <pause dur="short"/> I mean it's very few circumstances that you need that <pause dur="short"/> unless the employer is asking you to work with vulnerable people</u>
<u n="273" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="274" who="S0096">I mean it might be recruitment agencies that</u>
<u n="275" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="276" who="S0096">actually ask you for that detail <pause dur="short"/> if you're working for social care or</u>

<u n="284" who="S0096">for you to put your date of birth <pause dur="short"/> especially given the Equality Act</u>

<u n="286" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="287" who="S0030">yeah <pause dur="short"/> how about nationality? Would you put nationality on your CV? Or would you encourage your international students to put nationality on their CV?</u>
<u n="288" who="S0096">see that's a hot potato isn't it <pause dur="short"/> I mean how many careers advisers can you put in a room to discuss that? <vocal desc="laugh"/></u>

<u n="292" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="293" who="S0096">um <pause dur="short"/> no I er personally I would say there's things that are gonna give you away <pause dur="short"/> I mean I'm a British citizen <pause dur="short"/> but my name isn't your standard English name <pause dur="short"/> so I put my nationality on <pause dur="short"/> because other things will be indicators to employers <pause dur="short"/> you know <pause dur="short"/> your name <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> your education <pause dur="short"/> work experience <pause dur="short"/> especially if you're an international student</u>
<u n="294" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="295" who="S0096">so I do believe there will be elements of that that will already make an</u>

<u n="297" who="S0096">employer</u>
<u n="298" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="299" who="S0096">question whether you're a British student <pause dur="short"/> a home student <pause dur="short"/> eU</u>
<u n="300" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="301" who="S0096">or international</u>
<u n="302" who="S0030">mhm</u>
<u n="303" who="S0096">in which case if they're already asking those questions by you putting in your status or your rights to work</u>
<u n="304" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="305" who="S0096">your visa status</u>
<u n="306" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="307" who="S0096">you can make it much clearer</u>
<u n="308" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="309" who="S0096">for an employer</u>
<u n="310" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="311" who="S0096">so my personal take is yes put it on there</u>
<u n="312" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="313" who="S0096">but I know others <vocal desc="laugh"/> would disagree</u>
<u n="314" who="S0030">mm <pause dur="short"/> mm</u>
<u n="315" who="S0096">what do you feel?</u>
<u n="316" who="S0030">yeah <pause dur="short"/> I think actually um er er sometimes especially you know we we see international students who are looking for part-time work and they're allowed to work twenty hours a week while they're here <pause dur="short"/> you might make it might make sense to put Nigerian er nationality Nigerian and permission to work in the UK twenty <trunc>s</trunc> twenty hours a week</u>
<u n="317" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="318" who="S0030">um as a student <pause dur="short"/> and actually straight away you've allayed any fears or anxieties that employers may have about</u>
<u n="319" who="S0096">exactly</u>
<u n="320" who="S0030">employing international um people really</u>
<u n="321" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="322" who="S0030">so it's pragmatic <pause dur="short"/> probably me I've got a British sounding name <pause dur="short"/> I probably wouldn't put British on my CV</u>
<u n="323" who="S0096">mhm</u>
<u n="324" who="S0030">unless I was applying for like er potentially a job um <trunc>outsi</trunc> you know outside Britain where my nationality may be relevant</u>
<u n="325" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="326" who="S0030">um <pause dur="short"/> so um I think this is interesting <pause dur="short"/> I think that that's the beauty of CVs actually <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but um even though there's some very general guidelines um and some rules in a way er it's also very you've got to judge it each on each situation <pause dur="short"/> huh <pause dur="short"/> there was interestingly</u>
<u n="327" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="328" who="S0030">there was a discussion <pause dur="short"/> I don't know if you saw it <anon type="name" nameType="f"/> <pause dur="short"/> on um a LinkedIn group about should we have a um should in Britain we adopt a kind of more standard CV type <pause dur="short"/> a bit like the Europass CV</u>
<u n="329" who="S0096">ah <pause dur="short"/> no I missed that</u>
<u n="330" who="S0030">there was a discussion er on the LinkedIn UK HE careers professionals LinkedIn group <pause dur="short"/> and somebody started that um because I think they worked with they were working with college students <pause dur="short"/> and they were saying that CVs were so bad that they always thought it would be a lot better to say look this is your structure follow it <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but it generated quite a lot of debate <pause dur="short"/> and um I think kind of I I think actually for candidates and recruiters actually having a bit more huh general guidelines but some flexibility <pause dur="short"/> cos it means you as a candidate can make your CV your own</u>
<u n="331" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="332" who="S0030">your own sales document</u>
<u n="333" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="334" who="S0030">um <pause dur="short"/> and then also as recruiter sometimes if everybody's filling in a standard thing then it might make it harder for you to to kind of um sort of differentiate kind of the the different personalities <pause dur="short"/> er you know kind of</u>
<u n="335" who="S0096">yeah</u>
<u n="336" who="S0030">that might be applying <pause dur="short"/> so it's er it's an interesting one</u>
<u n="337" who="S0096">it is <pause dur="short"/> because I mean er what I say to students is don't assume that your CVs the first one</u>
<u n="338" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="339" who="S0096">in front of that recruiter</u>
<u n="340" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="341" who="S0096">or that indeed they're looking at it at first thing in the morning when they're sort of likely to be awake <pause dur="short"/> <vocal desc="laugh"/> You know <pause dur="short"/> and fresh and and you know your CV might be something that they're <trunc>r</trunc> <trunc>r</trunc> reviewing on a train</u>
<u n="342" who="S0030">mm</u>
<u n="343" who="S0096">it might be something that they've sort of</u>

<u n="465" who="S0096">that it's just worthwhile as a courtesy to kind of explain a little bit more <pause dur="short"/> and the cover letter is your chance again to really demonstrate your knowledge and</u>

<u n="480" who="S0030">and I completely I would er completely um agree huh with that <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but I think often the real tailoring is done is an er in any letter that goes with the CV <pause dur="short"/> that er sometimes you can have a CV that may be fairly similar</u>
<u n="481" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="482" who="S0030">actually <pause dur="short"/> <trunc>t</trunc> you know you might tweak it slightly depending on what you're applying for <pause dur="short"/> um <pause dur="short"/> but it could be a fundamentally very similar document <pause dur="short"/> but the real tailoring of your application is going in your covering letter <pause dur="short"/> so sometimes I think as careers advisers we may overplay the your CV must be really tailored</u>
<u n="483" who="S0096">er yeah</u>
<u n="484" who="S0030">when in actual fact yes you can tailor it a bit <pause dur="short"/> it might mean changing the objective or the <trunc>c</trunc> the the order of things and how you <trunc>f</trunc> you've kind of played around with the CV a little bit</u>
<u n="485" who="S0096">mm</u>
<u n="486" who="S0030">but the er the real tailoring can <trunc>m</trunc> may be in the <trunc>c</trunc> the letter</u>
