text_id,u_n,u_who,text
S2FQ,55,S0261,it is not crass in any sense
S2FQ,36,S0262,yeah that's really big and he looked like that
S2FQ,218,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,190,S0262,yeah 
S2FQ,170,S0262,yeah but also 
S2FQ,156,S0262,that's the topic
S2FQ,37,S0261,mm
S2FQ,144,S0262,yeah you do but I think you know you've got to talk to the right people and suss out your ideas a bit more as well because like honestly it hadn't occurred to me until today and it obviously had to you but you hadn't discussed it with me
S2FQ,39,S0261,mm
S2FQ,99,S0261,what is it that you like? 
S2FQ,129,S0261,and so they had that problem and so they sent out another another way of doing it and after three weeks they actually got to their target market which were er business women yeah who would be paying two hundred bucks for a pair of shoes 
S2FQ,50,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,154,S0262,the topic I think I understand though the question is one thing but the topic is another and it is true like what 
S2FQ,198,S0262,mm
S2FQ,54,S0262,no
S2FQ,172,S0262,alright but what I am interested in is the topic that it is the mix of the people 
S2FQ,178,S0262,mm
S2FQ,15,S0261,okay let's just for example say talk let's say car mechanics okay just for the sake of it and you've got erm Johnny who's just left school and he wants to be a car mechanic and he's got an interest and he's been doing some stuff himself and he has a problem 
S2FQ,180,S0262,mm mm
S2FQ,69,S0261,and so if if you can pin this together in such a way that there is a real community that's meeting
S2FQ,184,S0262,yeah but it's fudging it
S2FQ,183,S0261,so they are not miles ahead they are not angel investors they are not 
S2FQ,14,S0262,mm 
S2FQ,166,S0262,which is what 
S2FQ,65,S0261,so do you think they are going to pick up on threads like erm 
S2FQ,194,S0262,no 
S2FQ,60,S0262,mm
S2FQ,150,S0262,so from what we put on the board I was running with this very general kind of sense of things
S2FQ,33,S0261,now we find a a synonym for solving yeah
S2FQ,169,S0261,we don't have we don't have we don't intrinsically have a track record that is enough to speak with authority
S2FQ,8,S0262,yeah but what?  what should we start with? I mean what's the sort of thing that's going to be the most compelling?
S2FQ,197,S0261,but you get the point erm these communities er er are quite disparate there are several groups
S2FQ,242,S0262,I don't have the time lady
S2FQ,57,S0261,it is supposed to be educational and and if people don't get the sense of 
S2FQ,89,S0261,yeah it is already behind the times
S2FQ,139,S0261,they they have a different enough idea that it is disruptive to an existing industry
S2FQ,48,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,152,S0262,yeah but I think you will get
S2FQ,126,S0262,wow
S2FQ,231,S0261,mm
S2FQ,94,S0262,well yeah but nowadays we can have quite a lot of you know immediate publishing you know in terms of news 
S2FQ,51,S0261,where either the storyline is defined by some outside source or the likes of Big Brother where people vote on who survives and who doesn't
S2FQ,137,S0261,and the reason why it is is because there are enough 
S2FQ,31,S0261,so it's it's crowd solving
S2FQ,113,S0261,mm
S2FQ,204,S0262,well that's alright that's a networking session I don't mind that it is not a learning session though
S2FQ,217,S0261,but we are moving into a society where everybody is expected to be more open and transparent
S2FQ,131,S0261,so that just shows through using a different mechanism how and and there's nothing complicated about what they've done 
S2FQ,79,S0262,and they all 
S2FQ,19,S0261,no no no I am not I am just all I've I am not talking about finding a job all I'm doing is using that as an example that that this person wants to go forward in some context in this case I said he wanted to jump forward in doing what he is passionate about
S2FQ,216,S0262,it's a bit silly
S2FQ,148,S0262,they are you know not really related to each other
S2FQ,160,S0262,are just questions I asked but the topic is entrepreneurs so I can't really say the topic is university students I would prefer to have something that's got a little bit more bite to it than that
S2FQ,222,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,223,S0261,and the start-up and tech community in 
S2FQ,67,S0261,and what I believe in is that it needs to be balanced
S2FQ,207,S0261,and and then they can see well erm naturally these people get together and do this kind of networking solving problem stuff anyway
S2FQ,92,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,28,S0262,the only reason why I kind of I know what you mean but 
S2FQ,32,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,241,S0261,okay that's there what's the time?
S2FQ,64,S0262,yeah so you've got a couple of academics thrown in 
S2FQ,168,S0262,well what about if we put
S2FQ,119,S0261,and erm that's what intrigued me so much about this 
S2FQ,59,S0261,and and if we can demonstrate to people erm 
S2FQ,220,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,10,S0262,and how much of it has got a kind of teaching not teaching but an educational kind of slant to it? 
S2FQ,112,S0262,so if you are young you are thinking about making a start-up
S2FQ,16,S0262,mm mm
S2FQ,227,S0261,that's what I am seeing
S2FQ,100,S0262,okay that erm 
S2FQ,102,S0262,and validated
S2FQ,125,S0261,right 
S2FQ,211,S0261,and that's why they think it is all special because I'm all part of the team
S2FQ,225,S0261,yeah well that's the way it is kind of working around the around the world erm and I bet that the people who are going forward here now have been watching what's been going on in the US for a long time yeah they simply 
S2FQ,88,S0262,he's kind of got a point because the more I'm thinking about it the more I like it because even the latest research from academics that would be put into a curriculum won't be nearly as up to date oh no no current as some of the things that we would discuss
S2FQ,43,S0261,so what you are trying to demonstrate is er as an outcome of this thing is over a very short period of time you are demonstrating comparative er progress that it is significant progress
S2FQ,95,S0261,yeah but once it is published it is old news
S2FQ,228,S0262,well yeah I mean you know fair enough erm
S2FQ,235,S0261,people will have an interest and try and make something go forward with progress
S2FQ,147,S0261,mm
S2FQ,171,S0261,yeah but what you didn't know until today is is that before he got into that he had built a forty million dollar company when he was twenty-three
S2FQ,5,S0261,er however that might be formed and 
S2FQ,97,S0261,okay so carry on what is it that you like?
S2FQ,73,S0261,and that can have representatives who come from other places who join there and so they become part of a like community
S2FQ,44,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,2,S0262,to do with social storytelling and how to teach someone how to problem solve 
S2FQ,233,S0261,the potential is you're going to get a lot more positive stories out of it because of the nature of it being a start-up
S2FQ,230,S0262,I like it I like it as a topic I think it's it's it's a good way to at least run with something to start with I think we needed to define what we were going to run with
S2FQ,114,S0262,you think maybe I should go to university and study this oh no crap I am not going to study this at university I am going to find another way and this is a complementary way of looking at things
S2FQ,24,S0262,goal
S2FQ,181,S0261,erm that they're still learning but they're a few steps ahead of where other people are going
S2FQ,202,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,46,S0262,mm
S2FQ,101,S0261,mm
S2FQ,25,S0261,the race track
S2FQ,151,S0261,and that's fine as long as you block all of those things under the guise of they're all students
S2FQ,71,S0261,and like some other models that are working around the world at the moment you can set up satellite communities in different places around the world which are doing exactly the same model as you you are that the inputs can be international but the local community base is of the local ilk
S2FQ,82,S0262,so start-ups now what's a definition of a start-up?
S2FQ,3,S0261,okay so one of the key things is about erm ensuring that we operate within a certain niche
S2FQ,96,S0262,yeah I'm talking about curriculum in universities
S2FQ,103,S0261,yeah
S2FQ,128,S0262,mm
S2FQ,141,S0261,so 
S2FQ,212,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,7,S0261,well you could certainly pick anything and you can go I am going to run through this process with the same 
S2FQ,93,S0261,because it takes time to be able to publish it
S2FQ,72,S0262,mm
S2FQ,26,S0262,let me speak it is all about 
S2FQ,30,S0262,but solving isn't solving like a riddle or solving a situation whatever isn't a problem I think solving things finding ways to solve things is very useful for people 
S2FQ,203,S0261,and they say they are going to do something but they are not doers and then you have got the real people who are doers who go there to network to find people to partner with yeah 
S2FQ,191,S0261,I know
S2FQ,12,S0262,I don't know I don't know whether you bring in as an interviewer whether I'm you know bringing in some erm say external reading from different authors or I am just really keeping everything on track just being an interviewer and focusing right onto the person whose er 
S2FQ,124,S0262,wow
S2FQ,237,S0261,yeah
S2FQ,34,S0262,yeah crowd solving yeah
S2FQ,4,S0262,mm mm
S2FQ,35,S0261,something like that yeah and 
S2FQ,122,S0262,mm mm
S2FQ,70,S0262,yeah 
S2FQ,120,S0262,mm
S2FQ,205,S0261,no but my point is if you join all that together as you're picking these people out of these groups within the groups the people know the people right so that's your niche that's your crowd
S2FQ,196,S0262,mm
S2FQ,83,S0261,erm there's actually a proper definition of it erm a lot of people think it's just kind of starting up a company but erm there is a formal definition of it let me just find out erm 
S2FQ,239,S0261,I mean the nice idea for these people to become connected through 
S2FQ,187,S0261,do it backwards
S2FQ,49,S0261,and that gets the community involved in you know and you would have seen examples of that on telly I think with with programming and stuff
S2FQ,123,S0261,and they said we would like to use you to promote our products we have got custom design your own shoe and they ended up having to pay her money because she had a Hollywood agent and so on and so on they paid her some money she did it 
S2FQ,21,S0261,which is car mechanics
S2FQ,121,S0261,erm they simply came across a Youtube video of sixteen year olds who were teaching each other how to put on makeup and so they contacted a girl in the US who was teaching this to other students and making money out of it
S2FQ,143,S0261,and what is it that's holding you up at the moment? what's your hurdle? yeah so you would go through that you would discover what the hurdle is 
S2FQ,199,S0261,people go to different groups erm talking to a couple of people last week they kind of go along to these things and say that sometimes they are a bit hit-and-miss
S2FQ,213,S0261,and everybody else is out there you know
S2FQ,146,S0262,that it was going to be on a certain kind of niche I hadn't got got that from what we put up on the board those problems are three very very different types of problems
S2FQ,41,S0261,effectively to do something efficiently
S2FQ,108,S0262,that if you are a student
S2FQ,153,S0261,well they are all problems that students could learn
S2FQ,133,S0261,well they've just used things 
S2FQ,86,S0262,actually you know what
S2FQ,135,S0261,to to create a viral story
S2FQ,159,S0261,mm
S2FQ,109,S0261,yes
S2FQ,224,S0262,it is interesting what 
S2FQ,17,S0261,and too often what happens is you know there's all this formal bullshit HR I need a good person I need to apply for a job a thousand ways using shitty CV interview approach with some a lot of people don't know how to interview and I am not given the opportunity to demonstrate myself or to show how valuable I can be to these people right and you will get people on all sorts of different levels but the reality is is that there is a comparative level and connection which goes together with personality and it goes together with skill base yeah
S2FQ,1,S0261,we've just been spending time talking with 
S2FQ,68,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,45,S0261,that's that's what you are showing people if 
S2FQ,243,S0261,the time old lady is quarter to nine
S2FQ,236,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,177,S0261,I I'm quite attracted to their thing erm I the reason why first they are in 
S2FQ,208,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,188,S0262,no I mean the people in 
S2FQ,87,S0261,can it continue to grow?
S2FQ,232,S0262,and I like it because I can see I could you know
S2FQ,142,S0262,mm
S2FQ,226,S0262,bugger
S2FQ,18,S0262,yeah but I don't want it to become just about finding a job for example
S2FQ,209,S0261,it is just that it is all kind of kept together nobody is learning from it it is just their little bubble
S2FQ,238,S0262,erm 
S2FQ,175,S0261,it is in the demographic where things do really kind of happen
S2FQ,185,S0261,well
S2FQ,56,S0262,no it is meant to be educational
S2FQ,117,S0261,yeah mm mm and the good thing with with with probably all of them is that they have a connection they had probably if you get them to distribute what they are talking about effectively and you somehow attach a product to it that by word of mouth you can get stuff out there fairly quickly
S2FQ,98,S0262,it's it's it's it's current
S2FQ,81,S0261,thing yeah
S2FQ,13,S0261,you see I've got this this thing about problem solving I don't I'm not convinced that's what it's about 
S2FQ,106,S0262,they are meant to have their lecturer do that for them by bringing in their own research and their research informs their teaching but it doesn't happen that way people say it happens like that but it doesn't
S2FQ,219,S0261,and with the way that information is spread anyway you can find out a hell of a lot without having a talk to these people in the first place
S2FQ,176,S0262,yeah so we could you know interview the the people from the shoes
S2FQ,138,S0262,mm
S2FQ,162,S0262,yeah the topic is education
S2FQ,118,S0262,mm
S2FQ,145,S0261,mm
S2FQ,127,S0261,on that site on that day and 
S2FQ,110,S0262,and you want to learn about start-ups you ain't get your needs satisfied at university unless you're incredibly lucky
S2FQ,107,S0261,right okay  alright so what is it that you like? you like that
S2FQ,105,S0261,so it is quite 
S2FQ,174,S0262,well then start-ups is great because it's around the demographic we're interested in
S2FQ,214,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,149,S0261,mm mm
S2FQ,29,S0261,mm
S2FQ,167,S0261,part of the problem I have with it is 
S2FQ,221,S0261,so 
S2FQ,161,S0261,the topic is education
S2FQ,215,S0261,but
S2FQ,173,S0261,oh they are 
S2FQ,27,S0261,yeah you could say that you could say that mm mm
S2FQ,23,S0261,he could he could go down
S2FQ,11,S0261,what's the education element?
S2FQ,58,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,200,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,53,S0261,or whatever yeah but it is not as crass as that
S2FQ,192,S0262,I was thinking how nice it would be to be tucked up in bed with a nice little cup of something hot
S2FQ,186,S0262,that's a really weird way of doing things
S2FQ,130,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,240,S0262,I think I am going to have to call it there tonight
S2FQ,90,S0262,but it means
S2FQ,234,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,193,S0261,mulled wine
S2FQ,62,S0262,well this is going to fascinate me on what niche we're 
S2FQ,40,S0262,how to really collaborate
S2FQ,75,S0261,yeah
S2FQ,66,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,80,S0262,entrepreneurial
S2FQ,22,S0262,yeah no I get that so it is more like
S2FQ,158,S0262,the questions I ask
S2FQ,155,S0261,mm
S2FQ,78,S0262,that's true it is just that it is about start-ups
S2FQ,111,S0261,yeah
S2FQ,104,S0262,and accredited
S2FQ,115,S0261,yeah 
S2FQ,63,S0261,it is a depression site yeah
S2FQ,76,S0262,mm
S2FQ,91,S0261,anything that's published is like that
S2FQ,42,S0262,mm
S2FQ,189,S0261,yeah okay I can run with that erm I haven't looked around the net erm at start-up types there must be 
S2FQ,77,S0261,erm 
S2FQ,182,S0262,mm
S2FQ,140,S0262,well I would say our idea is probably quite disruptive
S2FQ,74,S0262,mm
S2FQ,20,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,210,S0262,yeah that's true
S2FQ,61,S0261,but you are actually demonstrating how effective they can be in a very short period of time
S2FQ,206,S0262,yeah yeah
S2FQ,47,S0261,yeah which we kind of indicated up on the board the other day about how you really need this other input
S2FQ,157,S0261,mm
S2FQ,201,S0261,so you will get an element of people who go there just to be listeners
S2FQ,136,S0262,mm
S2FQ,85,S0261,I just said the most pizzery burp how burpy pizzery it was so I am just looking up the definition of start-up because 
S2FQ,116,S0262,in fact I can think of of already three people I could interview 
S2FQ,134,S0262,mm
S2FQ,165,S0261,yeah
S2FQ,132,S0262,they have yeah without much of a marketing budget by the sounds of things
S2FQ,229,S0261,it doesn't mean to say that you can't do anything it's just that
S2FQ,163,S0261,topic is learning topic is self-learning topic is self-directed learning topic is
S2FQ,52,S0262,yeah
S2FQ,179,S0261,and that he is now quite connected with er investors various 
S2FQ,6,S0262,yeah that will require a bit of market research
